            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE end of a thing</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Eccl. <hi>7, 8.) is better than the beginning thereof.</hi> Not that all things end better than they begin: ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons begin well, and ſome things are begun well, which end, and are ended not ſo well, that I ſay not very ill.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:48669:3"/>
            <p>Through the All-diſpoſing providence of God, and the importunate call of not a few worthy friends, I began this Work; and now, after twenty-four years travel, making twelve ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges (in ſo many parts, the whole is come forth) I am come to the end of it; And truly, I might juſtly be reproved, at leaſt, for dulneſs and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, or counted a very ſlow-paced Traveller, had I ſpent that twenty-four years (the beſt of my time and ſtrength) in meaſuring ſo ſhort a journey. But, as I have this to ſay towards an Apology for my over-long ſtay in this work, that I have had frequent diverſions, for a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble part of that time, quite from it; ſo the whole time which I have ſpent in it, hath been but a diverſion, or time (I hope, honeſtly) ſtoln, either from my reſt, or from that which was my more proper work</p>
            <p>And, now that <hi>I</hi> have, at last, ended what I began, all that I ſhall ſay of it, is, that <hi>I</hi> have ended it. Whether <hi>I</hi> began it well, or have ended it well, and whether or no the end be better than the beginning, is not for me to ſay. Should <hi>I</hi> ſay, that <hi>I</hi> began it well, and have ended it well, or that the end is better than the beginning, it were a piece of moſt immodeſt pride; and ſhould <hi>I</hi> ſay the contrary of both, or of either, it might
<pb facs="tcp:48669:3"/> deſervedly be called more than a piece of proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt modeſty. Such as it is, from the beginning to the end, 'tis what my weakneſs, with the ſtrength of Chriſt given in; what my ſmall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſneſs, with the bleſſing given down from above, could attain unto. And <hi>I</hi> humbly give thanks to the Father of lights, from whom every good gift, and every perfect gift cometh, for any light received or held out towards the underſtanding of this Book; in which (who ſees not?) there are many things (as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles) <hi>hard to be underſtood,</hi> ſo hard to be underſtood, that, though <hi>I</hi> am confident (through the grace of God with me) <hi>I</hi> have not <hi>wreſted</hi> them to my own hurt, or the hurt (much leſs deſtruction) of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, (as 'tis there ſaid, <hi>the ignorant and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable do the other Scriptures, to their own deſtruction</hi>) yet <hi>I</hi> am not aſhamed to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that <hi>I</hi> fear <hi>I</hi> have not attained ſo clear an underſtanding about ſome of them, as to clear them (which hath been my deſire) with ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to the underſtanding of others. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, if what <hi>I</hi> have attained to, may be in any meaſure ſerviceable to the Church of God, or helpful to any poor ſoul in an afflicted condition (ſuch was <hi>Jobs) I</hi> have reached one great end
<pb facs="tcp:48669:4"/> aimed at; and if God have any glory by it, <hi>I</hi> have reached the greateſt end which can be aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at. And though the work ſhould be found to have many defects, poſſibly miſtakes, in it, yet the ingenuous Reader will candidly interpret them, or charitably cover them, knowing that failings are common to humane frailty, in the beſt of men, how much more in the meaneſt of them! And <hi>I</hi> ſhall account it a great kindneſs, if <hi>I</hi> may be friendly minded of thoſe defects; that ſo, if ever any of theſe Pieces ſhall be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to come out again, an amendment may be made, and the Work grow up to more perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>This laſt Part, now coming forth, contains the whole tranſaction (from first to laſt) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and <hi>Job,</hi> none ſpeaking but they two, and <hi>Job</hi> but very little. <hi>Elihu</hi> having fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht his ſpeech in the cloſe of the thirty ſeventh Chapter, the Lord himſelf appeared at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of the thirty eighth, in a Majeſtick and tremendous manner, beſpeaking <hi>Job</hi> out of a vehement and tempeſtuous whirlwind; and tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the ſame argument which <hi>Elihu</hi> had ſo much inſiſted upon before, for the conviction of <hi>Job,</hi> carrieth him in diſcourſe, quite through the univerſe, thereby farther to convince him, by
<pb facs="tcp:48669:4"/> the view and conſideration of his mighty and admirable works of creation and providence, how ignorant and weak he was in himſelf, how altogether unable and incompetent to contend with God, and therefore how raſh and inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate he had been, in not ſubmitting (how great ſoever his ſufferings were) more quietly to him. And, as <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaid (Chap. <hi>35.11.) That God teacheth us more than the beaſts of the earth, and maketh us wiſer than the fowls of Heaven:</hi> ſo doubtleſs, one great ſcope which the Lord had in his eye throughout that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, was to teach <hi>Job,</hi> and with him us, that his care was much more over him, and is over us, than over the beaſts of the earth, or the fowls of heaven. And hereupon having ſhewed his own infinite power and wiſdom, as alſo his goodneſs and tender compaſſions, in providing for all ſorts of irrational living creatures, he left <hi>Job,</hi> and leaves us to make the Inference, how watchful he is over, how reſpectful to man, a rational as well as a living creature. Our bleſſed Saviour preaching upon the ſame ſubject to his Diſciples, expreſſeth the Inference <hi>(Mat. 6.26.) Behold the fowls of the air, for they ſow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns, yet y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> heavenly father feedeth
<pb facs="tcp:48669:5"/> them: are ye not much better than they?</hi> And again <hi>(verſ. 30.) Wherefore it God ſo cloath the graſs of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is caſt into the oven: ſhall he not much more cloath you, O ye of little faith?</hi> Jeſus Chriſt ſaw it neceſſary to make theſe expreſs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications to his Diſciples, who, at that time, were both of little faith, and of little under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. But here the Lord left <hi>Job</hi> (a wiſe and knowing man) to pick or ſpell out his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and make application to himſelf, while he told him ſo particularly, how his providence at once over-ruled &amp; maintained, <hi>The roaring Lion, the wild Goat, the wilde Aſs the ſtubborn Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corn, the ſtrong Horſe, the mighty Behemoth</hi> among the beaſts of the earth; <hi>the devouring Raven, the proud Peacock, the fooliſh Oſtrich, the ſwift winged Hawk, and the high-ſoaring Eagle,</hi> among the fowls of the air; as alſo, <hi>the formidable Leviathan,</hi> among, or rather repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting all the fiſhes of the Sea.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Job</hi> having with ſteddy, yet trembling atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, heard all theſe words ſpoken to him, with irrefragable authority, by the Lord himſelf out of the whirlwind, ſate down convinced, that ſurely the great God, the Creator of the ends of the earth, who had ſo exact an eye upon all thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:48669:5"/> creatures, both for the continuance of their ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies or kinds, and the preſervation of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals or particulars, could not poſſibly caſt off the care of man-kind, nor of him in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, no nor put any man to any hardſhip or ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but for ſome great end or ends, glorious al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to himſelf, and in the iſſue good for the wiſe and patient ſufferer. He was alſo convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that himſelf not well underſtanding the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of providence (nor indeed could any more fully underſtand them, than he did the myſteries of creation, or the manner how God laid the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the earth, and ſhut up the ſea with doors; he, I ſay, not well underſtanding the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of providence, was convinced that he) had done very ill, to make ſuch long and loud complaints about it, that is, about the ſeverity of Gods dealings with him; as if like an enemy he intended him nothing but pain and ſorrow, by the pains and ſorrows which he endured.</p>
            <p>Thus, at laſt, <hi>Job</hi> began to ſee, that as being himſelf Gods creature, God might do with him what he pleaſed; and, that God, being his abſolute Soveraign, could not wrong him, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he was pleaſed to do with him: ſo that, foraſmuch as God was ſo careful of, and kind to thoſe inferior, reaſonleſs creatures, there was
<pb facs="tcp:48669:6"/> no ſhadow of a reaſon, why he ſhould have the leaſt jealouſie of Gods kindneſs to him and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of him, much leſs make ſuch an out-cry, that God was unkind to, and regardleſs of <hi>Him,</hi> whom he had not only ennobled, as the reſt of mankind, with reaſon, but renewed by grace, and filled with the holy fear of his great and glorious name.</p>
            <p>Theſe impreſſions being made upon <hi>Job,</hi> by the mighty power of God ſpeaking to him out of the whirlwind, he preſently cryed out as faſt againſt himſelf, and againſt his own ignorance and raſhneſs, as he had done before concerning the harſhneſs of his ſufferings under the hand of God; confeſſing <hi>(chap. 40.4.) Behold, I am vile, what ſhall I anſwer thee?</hi> And <hi>(chap. 42.3, 6.) I have uttered that I underſtood not, things too wonderful for me, which I knew not; wherefore, I abhor my ſelf and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent in duſt and aſhes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Job</hi> being thus humbled and melted down, <hi>Job</hi> who was lately in the duſt of diſhonour and almost in the duſt of death, being thus brought to the duſt of repentance; the Lord ſuffered him not to lye long there, but quickly raiſed him up out of all his ſufferings; and, paſſing by all his miſpeakings, while ſufferings lay heavy upon him, he (The Lord) paſſed ſentence upon, or
<pb facs="tcp:48669:6"/> gave judgment againſt <hi>Eliphaz</hi> and his two friends, as not having <hi>ſpoken of him the thing that was right, as his ſervant</hi> Job: and not only ſo, but commanded them to <hi>do him right,</hi> by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging that they had wronged him; why elſe were they ordered by the Lord to go unto him as a mediator for their peace? why elſe were they ordered by the Lord to bring their ſacrifice unto him, that he offering it up, and praying for them, the wrath of God which was kindled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, might be quenched, and they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into favour? All theſe offices of love <hi>Job</hi> freely did for them; and no ſooner had he done them, but God heaped favours upon him, dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling his former ſubſtance, and cauſing all his former friends, who had carried it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friendly, unhandſomely towards him, and would not own him in the day of his diſtreſs, to haſten their addreſſes, to bring him honourable preſents, and redintegrate their broken friendſhip with him. In all theſe things God <hi>bleſſed the latter end of</hi> Job <hi>more than his beginning,</hi> and he found by comfortable experience (which was men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned at the beginning of this prefatory Epiſtle out of <hi>Solomon's Eccleſiaſtes) that the end of a thing is better than the beginning of it;</hi> the latter end of his life being fuller of peace, riches,
<pb facs="tcp:48669:7"/> and honour, than the former; and he not ending his life in this world, till he was full of days, fuller of grace, and fully fitted for an endleſs life in glory.</p>
            <p>Thus, as in the foregoing parts of this book, <hi>we have heard of the patience of</hi> Job, ſo in this <hi>we may ſee</hi> (as the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>chap. 5.11.) the end of the Lord.</hi> But what was that end of the Lord? Any man of ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry capacity, reading the holy ſtory, may reſolve it in the common way, that, <hi>The Lord gave</hi> Job <hi>twice as much as he had before</hi> that (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſtored) his ſeven thouſand ſheep were multiplyed to fourteen thouſand, his three thouſand camels to ſix thouſand, his five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yoke of oxen to a thouſand, and his five hundred ſhe-aſſes to as many. This end of the Lord with <hi>Job</hi> is obvious, and runs in ſight to every Reader; nor can it be denied, but that this was a very good and an honourable end: yet, behold, the Lord made a much better, and more honourable end for <hi>Job</hi> than this. This was the end of <hi>Jobs</hi> croſs; that, was not only ſo, but alſo of his controverſie. Satan charged <hi>Job</hi> as an <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> his friends joyned with Satan in that, yet ſtayed not there, they charged him like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe as <hi>Hetorodox,</hi> as a man not only unſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
<pb facs="tcp:48669:7"/> in his profeſſion of religion, but unſound in the principles of it. The Lord made an end for <hi>Job</hi> in this matter alſo, abetting his opinion in that great and difficult probleme of providence rather than theirs, giving him the day, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the crown of victory upon his head in that diſpute, while he ſaid to <hi>Eliphaz</hi> and his two friends, <hi>Ye have not ſpoken of me the thing that is right, as my ſervant</hi> Job. <hi>This, this</hi> was <hi>The end of the Lord.</hi> To hear this gracious determination from the mouth of the ſupream and infallible moderator of all controverſies, was (without controverſie) a thouſand times more pleaſing and ſatisfactory to <hi>Jobs</hi> ſpirit, not only than the double cattle, which the Lord gave him, but, than if the Lord had given him all the cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle upon a thouſand hills; or than if all the fowls of the air, and fiſhes of the ſea, had been given to him.</p>
            <p>In this end of the Lord for <hi>Job,</hi> we may ſee not only that the Lord is infinitely <hi>wiſe and juſt,</hi> but (as it followeth in that place of the Apoſtle <hi>James) very pitiful and of tender mercy.</hi> The Lord ſhews himſelf very pitiful and of tender mercy, when he puts an end to the croſſes of his ſervants, by doubling their outward comforts; he doth ſo too, when he puts an end to the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies
<pb facs="tcp:48669:8"/> of his ſervants, by vindicating their credit, and making it appear, that they have ſpoken of him, and of his ways, the thing that is right, or more rightly than their oppoſers and reproachers. This example of the Lords pity and tender mercy in doing both for <hi>Job,</hi> may ſtrengthen our faith in believing that he will, and lengthen out our patience in waiting, till he doth make both theſe deſirable ends for all thoſe, who like <hi>Job</hi> have lay'n long under the preſſing burdens of hard afflictions, and harſh conſtructions.</p>
            <p>Now, that the Lord would finiſh this work of mercy, and cut it ſhort in righteouſneſs, <hi>wip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tears from off all faces, and taking away the rebuke of his people from off the earth,</hi> by a timely reſtitution of them to their loſt enjoyments, and blaſted credits (which yet will not be fully done, until <hi>the times of the reſtitution of all things, which God hath ſpoken by the mouth of all his holy Prophets ſince the world began; that the Lord (I ſay) would finiſh this work)</hi> ſhould be our unceſſant cry to God in prayer, for all his ſorrowing <hi>Jobs,</hi> even for all thoſe, who are any where <hi>companions in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> To his bleſſing, and the effectual working of his
<pb facs="tcp:48669:8"/> holy Spirit, I commend you in the peruſal of this enſuing commentary, that, reading ye may underſtand, believe, and profit to ſanctification, conſolation, and ſalvation, according to the will of God, and the hearts deſire of,</p>

We have heard <hi>Jobs</hi> three Friends ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly charging him: We have heard <hi>Job</hi> ſtiffely defending himſelf: We have heard <hi>Elihu,</hi> though moderating the matter between them, yet ſharply reproving him. <hi>Elihu</hi> was indeed a quick,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48669:10"/> but a neceſſary reprover, provided and ſent by God:</p>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ut the dealings of God, to a better and more ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive temper of ſpirit towards him, as alſo to lower thoughts of himſelf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Elihu</hi> fell upon the uſefull point, and hit (as I may ſay) the Nail on the head, he ſtruck the right Vein, and met with the pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant Humour: yet being young, and wanting gravity to ſet all home, and make it work; or, to make the impreſſion deep enough upon <hi>Job,</hi> it was but need that God himſelf ſhould ſecond him, and he did it to purpoſe, or with full effect; preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the ſame Arguments, for the main, which <hi>Elihu</hi> had begun; yet ſo, that we may manifeſtly diſcern a wide difference, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we reſpect words or things, matter or manner, between men, how much ſoever aſſiſted by the ſpirit of God, and God himſelf in ſpeaking.</p>
                  <p>Here <hi>the Eternal God Jehovah,</hi> having ſeen his faithful ſervant, and ſtout Champion <hi>Job,</hi> contending and wraſtling long with Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, his profeſſed enemy, and with his harſh and cenſorious, though both profeſſed and real Friends, foreſeeing alſo that if <hi>Job</hi> and his Friends (who had alſo been provoked by <hi>Elihu</hi>) ſhould have proceeded to anſwer him, a new broil muſt needs begin; God (I ſay) who never fails, nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſakes his in their extreamity, or in time of their greateſt need, ſeeing and fore-ſeeing all this, ſtept in moſt ſeaſonably, and moſt graciouſly to undertake the deciſion of this great Controverſie between <hi>Job</hi> and his Friends, in perſon, raiſing a ſtormy Wind, as a witneſs of his mighty preſence, or to teſtifie who was there, as alſo (though with a Fatherly love and affection, yet) impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially and plainly to convince <hi>Job</hi> of his errour, ſhewing him wherein he had offended, and bringing him at laſt upon his knees, in a ſelf-abhorrence and repentance in duſt and aſhes.</p>
                  <p>Thus God the chief Judge, the great Arbitrator, and Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miner of all doubts and queſtions, and of all matters and things; the great God (I ſay) declared himſelf, to whom <hi>Job</hi> had made
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48669:10"/> ſo many appeals, whom he ſo earneſtly deſired to take further and fuller cogniſance of his Cauſe, He, even He comes forth as a juſt and righteous Judge, and lets him and his Friends know his mind and judgement in the caſe. So then,</p>
                  <p>The Queſtion ventilated in this Book, is not ſtated according to the judgement of a man, who is ſubject to errour, but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the infinite wiſdom and underſtanding of the great God, who ſearcheth the heart, and knoweth all ſecrets, who is light, and in whom there is no darkneſs at all.</p>
                  <p>And indeed, in the latter part of this Book, we may well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive God himſelf ſpeaking, he ſpeaks ſo like himſelf: For here the underſtanding Reader may perceive a wonderful copiouſneſs of ſpeech, and largneſs of diſcourſe, ſtrengthened with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acteſt and weightieſt reaſons, ſet forth with ſuch variety of matter, with ſuch gravity of expreſſions, with ſuch preſſing queries and and interrogations, that it very much excells all that had been ſpoken either by the Diſputants or the Moderator.</p>
                  <p>And ſuch was the condeſcention of God, that he ſeems to take the words out of <hi>Elihu</hi>'s mouth, and urge over his Arguments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new, before he would give the final ſentence in this caſe; from which, as there could be no appeal, ſo, in which, there could be no miſtake. All this the Lord contracts into two Orations, or Speech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, each to of which <hi>Job</hi> Anſwers, and ſubſcribes by an humble ſubmiſſion.</p>
                  <p>The firſt of theſe Speeches, is contained in this thirty-eighth Chapter, and to the end of the thirty-ninth: To which God calls for an Anſwer in the two firſt Verſes of the fortieth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and <hi>Job</hi> gives his Anſwer in the third, fourth, and fifth ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of that Chapter.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Speech or Diſcourſe of God with <hi>Job</hi> begins at the ſixth verſe of the fortieth Chapter, and is continued to the end of the one and fortieth Chapter; to which we have <hi>Jobs</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer at the beginning of the forty ſecond Chapter, to the end of the ſixth verſe; and then the Chapter cloſeth with Gods ſpecial and irrefragable Judgement upon, or determination of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion between <hi>Job</hi> and his Friends, as alſo with a deſcription of <hi>Jobs</hi> bleſſed reſtauration after his fall, to a higher condition of outward proſperity and tranquility than ever he enjoyed before. Thus you have the ſumme of what's behind of the whole Book.</p>

                  <p>This Chapter with the next hold out the Lords firſt Argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation or di courſe with <hi>Job,</hi> and in it we may conſider three things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The Preface or Introduction, in the firſt, ſecond, and third Verſes of this Chapter.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Speech it ſelf, to the end of the thirty-ninth Chapter.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Gods demand of an Anſwer, or that <hi>Job</hi> ſhould give him an account of himſelf, or of what he had ſaid at the beginning of the fortieth Chapter.</p>
                  <p>The words under preſent conſideration are a Preface or Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, leading to the whole buſineſs, and in them we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider three things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The Hiſtorians tranſition, or, an Hiſtorical tranſition, (verſ. 1.) <hi>Then the Lord anſwered Job out of the Whirl-wind, and ſaid.</hi> This the Hiſtorian or Pen-man of this Book inſerts to connect the matter of this Chapter with that which went before; he connects the diſcourſe of <hi>Elihu,</hi> which ended at the thirty-ſeventh Chapter, with the diſcourſe of God at the beginning of this: <hi>Then the Lord anſwered Job out of the Whirle-wind, and ſaid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, We have here what the Lord ſaid, in form of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, leading in the intended matter; and that,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, By way of reprehenſion, or by a chiding Queſtion about what <hi>Job</hi> had ſaid (verſ. 2.) <hi>Who is this that darkeneth counſel by words without knowledge?</hi> This is it which the Lord ſaid, when he began with <hi>Job; Who is this that darkeneth counſel, by words without knowledge?</hi> As if he had ſaid, let me ſee the man, or, who is the man that ſpeaketh thus? I know there is a Queſtion (and I ſhall ſpeak ſomewhat to it afterwards) Whether theſe words were directed to <hi>Job</hi> or <hi>Elihu;</hi> yea, ſome Queſtion, whether this whole Chapter be not intended to <hi>Elihu</hi> rather than to <hi>Job,</hi> (I ſhall anſwer that Queſtion alſo afterwards) but I give it now in the analyſis of the context, as I pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>poſe, God willing, to ſtate it when I come to the Anſwer of that Queſtion: And therefore I ſay the reproof falls upon <hi>Job,</hi> whom God thus beſpake, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with a chiding, <hi>Who is this that darkneth counſel, by words without knowledge?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, by way of provocation to anſwer; or, we have here
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48669:11"/> the Lords command given <hi>Job</hi> to prepare himſelf for an Anſwer, as well as he could, to what himſelf ſhould ſay (verſ. 3.) <hi>Gird up now thy loynes like a man, for I will demand of thee, and anſwer thou me.</hi> As the Lord reproved and chid him for what he had ſaid, ſo the Lord exhorted and encouraged him to ſet and fit himſelf the beſt he was able, to anſwer what himſelf had to ſay unto him.</p>
                  <p>Thus we have the intendment of theſe three Verſes; and if you would have in one word, a Proſpect of the whole following Diſcourſe, of God with <hi>Job,</hi> the Sum of it may be given and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken thus:</p>
                  <p>That as <hi>Elihu</hi> before, ſo now the Lord would have <hi>Job</hi> know and confeſs that no man muſt preſume to be ſo bold with him as to queſtion his doings; that's the great mark at which God aimed in all he ſaid to <hi>Job.</hi> And the confirmation or proof of it is taken up from this unqueſtionable ground; <hi>No man muſt Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion any thing which God doth to him or with him, for this very reaſon, Becauſe God doth it; or, becauſe God often alone, alwayes in chief, hath done and doth all things.</hi> God is the alone Creator of all things, he hath given all things their Being, he hath put all things into the Order in which they ſtand, and he preſerves them in their ſtanding; and if any evil befal man, the hand of God hath done it much more than the hand of any man: what then hath any man to do to queſtion his doings?</p>
                  <p>Now that God alone hath created and doth order all things, he himſelf proves, by calling <hi>Job</hi> to ſhew where he was <hi>When the Foundation of the Earth was laid, and Bounds were ſet to the Sea,</hi> &amp;c. and ſo proceeds to aſſert and hold forth his ſole Power in furniſhing the Earth with Beaſts, the Air with Fowls, and the Sea with Fiſh.</p>
                  <p>The Lord having thus given <hi>Job</hi> to underſtand, that the whole World is his Work, and that he gave Being to all the Creatures in the World for the help of man, without the help of man, would have him thereby alſo underſtand and be convinced, that he and all men ought to adore, and quietly ſubmit to his providential workings, or the products of his Providence all the world over.</p>
                  <p>That's (as was ſaid) the general Point carried through this whole Diſcourſe of God with <hi>Job,</hi> the particulars whereof yeeld much
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48669:12"/> matter both of Meditation and Admiration. I begin with the Preface:
<q>
                        <bibl>
                           <hi>Verſ. 1.</hi>
                        </bibl> Then the Lord anſwered Job out of the Whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind, and ſaid.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this Verſe we have three things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The Perſon anſwering.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Perſon anſwered.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The manner of his Anſwer.</p>
                  <p>The Perſon anſwering is, <hi>the Lord;</hi> the Perſon anſwered, is <hi>Job;</hi> the manner of the Anſwer is, <hi>out of a Whirle-wind; Then the Lord anſwered Job out of the Whirle-wind.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the firſt word of the Text, we have (that which our Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation makes emphatical) an intimation of the time or ſeaſon of this Divine interpoſition; <hi>then the Lord anſwered,</hi> &amp;c. The Hebrew Text doth not expreſſe this Adverb of time, there 'tis onely, <hi>the Lord anſwered,</hi> but we well ſupply it, rendering, <hi>then the Lord anſwered;</hi> as if the Penman had ſaid, at that very nick, inſtant or juncture of time, the Lord came in; the words were no ſooner out of the mouth of <hi>Elihu,</hi> he had no ſooner concluded his ſpeech with <hi>Job,</hi> but the Lord began, and anſwered <hi>Job;</hi> and if the Lord had not juſt then interpoſed, poſſibly <hi>Job</hi> might have replyed, and a new heat might have riſen, to the encreaſing of his troubles, and the inflaming of all their Spirits (as was hinted before) therefore the Lord to ſtop all further proceedings, or ſpeech between them two, began pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to ſpeak himſelf. <hi>Then the Lord anſwered.</hi> Take this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation from it;
<q>The Lord will appear in the fitteſt ſeaſon.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was time for the Lord to appear, leſt this poor man ſhould have been utterly ſwallowed up with ſorrows, and over-whelmed with his affliction, or leſt he ſhould have been drawn out too long and too far in his bitter complainings and impatiency. <hi>The Lord is a God of judgement; bleſſed are they that wait for him (Iſa.</hi> 30.18.) He is a wiſe God, and knows how to time every action; he knowes when to appear, when to ſhew himſelf. As he himſelf <hi>will not contend for ever (Iſa.</hi> 57.16.) ſo neither will he let others contend overlong, leaſt the Spirit ſhould ſail before him,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48669:12"/> and the ſoules which he hath made. This is a comfortable truth with reſpect both to Nations, and Perſons, both to the caſe of the Church of God in general, and of every believer in particular. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> having counſelled the afflicted to <hi>humble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under the mighty hand of God</hi> (1 Pet. 5.6.) addes this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement (in the next words) to do ſo, <hi>that he may exalt you in due time:</hi> though not in your time, nor at your day, the day when you would have him do it; yet he will do it in time, and <hi>in due time,</hi> that is, when it ſhall be moſt fit and beſt for you. Thus he appeared to and for <hi>Job</hi> in the Text, when the ſorrowes of his heart were enlarged, and when he had moſt need of ſuch an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance. The Lord knows how at any time, and when 'tis the moſt proper time, to relieve his ſervants. <hi>Then</hi>
                     <q>The Lord anſwered Job.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The word here uſed is <hi>Jehovah;</hi> and ſeveral of the Learned take notice, that it is here uſed with a ſpecial ſignificancy: for in the diſcourſes of <hi>Job</hi> and his friends throughout this Book, other names of God are, if not univerſally, yet moſtly uſed, as <hi>Elſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dai, Eloah, &amp;c.</hi> In the firſt Chapter indeed, where God is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of by the divine Hiſtorian or ſacred Penman of this Hiſtory, he is named <hi>Jehovah,</hi> as alſo in ſome other ſuch like places; but in the body of the diſpute not ſo: And two reaſons may be given of it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The name <hi>Jehovah</hi> imports the Being of God; and therefore God himſelf, being about to ſpeak of his giving a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the whole Creation, and to ſeveral ſorts of creatures, he is moſt properly repreſented by his name <hi>Jehovah,</hi> which, as it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth that he is the Firſt Being, the Fountain of his own Being, or that he is of himſelf, ſo, that he gives a Being to all things, and that <hi>in him</hi> (as the Apoſtle told the great Philoſophers of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, Acts</hi> 17.) <hi>we live, and move, and have our being.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Lord (though he came in a Whirle-wind, yet) manifeſted himſelf in a clearer light to <hi>Job,</hi> than ever he had done before. Now, as in the third of <hi>Exodus,</hi> when the Lord ſent <hi>Moſes</hi> to the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to bring them up out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> to <hi>Canaan,</hi> (which was a great work, one of the greateſt that was ever done in the world, and in which the Lord made the moſt glorious diſcovery of his Power, Juſtice, and Mercy; when God
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48669:13"/> I ſay, ſent <hi>Moſes</hi> upon this ſervice) <hi>he ſaid unto him</hi> (Exod. 6.2, 3.) <hi>I am the Lord, I am Jehovah, and I appeared unto Abraham, unto Iſaac, and unto Jacob by the Name of God Almighty; but by my name Jehovah was I not known to them.</hi> God being about to make himſelf more known in the world, than he had been to that day, by his dreadful plagues upon <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and the miraculous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance of his people out of <hi>Egypt</hi> (as he ſaid (<hi>chap.</hi> 9.16.) <hi>And in very deed, for this cauſe have I raiſed thee up, for to ſhew in thee my power, and that my name may be declared in all the earth.</hi> The Lord, I ſay, being about to doe theſe great things for the manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his own greatneſs) gave this charge to <hi>Moſes</hi> at the ſixth verſe of the ſixth chapter before mentioned; <hi>Wherefore ſay unto the children of Iſrael, I am Jehovah, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians,</hi> &amp;c. Thus in this latter part of the book of <hi>Job,</hi> the Lord being about to looſen the bonds of <hi>Jobs</hi> affliction, and to eaſe him of his burden, as alſo to declare and manifeſt himſelf more clearly to him than formerly (as he confeſſed (<hi>chap.</hi> 42.5.) <hi>I have heard of thee by the hearing of the eare; but now mine eyes have ſeen thee)</hi> he therefore aſſumed his great name <hi>Jehovah. Then the Lord</hi>
                     <q>Anſwered Job, &amp;c.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But ſome may ſay, <hi>Job</hi> had not ſpoken lately, much leſſe laſt. <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpake out ſix whole Chapters ſince <hi>Job</hi> ſpake a word; and though <hi>Elihu</hi> gave him the liberty, yea almoſt provoked him to ſpeak, yet he laid his hand upon his mouth, he ſpake not a word. How then can it be ſaid, <hi>The Lord anſwered Job?</hi> To avoid this difficulty,</p>
                  <p>Some render, <hi>Then the Lord anſwered concerning, or about Job;</hi> And theſe turn the whole diſcourſe of God in this and the next Chapter upon <hi>Elihu,</hi> in favour of <hi>Job.</hi> I ſhall touch upon that opinion and interpretation (as was ſaid) afterwards: but at preſent affirm, that <hi>Job</hi> was the perſon to whom the Lord here directed his Anſwer; and to take off this doubt, how the Lord could be ſaid to anſwer <hi>Job,</hi> when <hi>Job</hi> had not ſpoken laſt, but <hi>Elihu,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer (as upon a like occaſion it hath been elſewhere ſhewed in this book <hi>ch.</hi> 3.2.) that ſometimes in Scripture, a Speech begun is called an Anſwer, where nothing had been ſpoken before, to which that ſpeech could be applied in way of anſwer, <hi>Matth.</hi>
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:48669:13"/> 11.25. <hi>Matth.</hi> 17.4. The reaſon of this Hebraiſme, is becauſe ſuch as begin to ſpeak, do either anſwer the neceſſity of the matter, or the deſire of the hearers; and ſo they give a real and vertual, though not a formal Anſwer. Yet there are two conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, in which we may apply the word Anſwer, formally and ſtrictly taken, to <hi>Job.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, If we conſider <hi>Job's</hi> wiſhes and requeſts.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If we conſider <hi>Job's</hi> complaints, and (though the word be ſomewhat hard) his murmurings: The Lord may be ſaid to anſwer <hi>Job,</hi> as to his wiſh, deſire, or requeſt; becauſe <hi>Job</hi> had earneſtly deſired and requeſted more than once, that God would take his Cauſe in hand, or that he would have the hearing of it. Thus he ſpake at the third verſe of the three and twentieth Chapter: <hi>O that I knew where I might find him, that I might come even to his Seat: I would order my Cauſe before him, and fill my mouth with arguments. Zophar</hi> alſo, one of <hi>Jobs</hi> friends, made the ſame requeſt concerning <hi>Job</hi> (Chap. 11.2.) <hi>O that God would ſpeak, and open his lips againſt thee:</hi> As if he had ſaid, <hi>Eliphaz</hi> hath been ſpeaking, and <hi>Bildad</hi> hath been ſpeaking, and I am now about to ſpeak, but O that God would ſpeak. It was the wiſh of <hi>Job</hi> that God would ſpeak, and it was the wiſh of this his friend, and now behold God appears, poſſibly beyond their expectation, though not beſide their wiſh; for 'tis like they had not faith enough to beleeve that God would anſwer thoſe wiſhes. So then, God may be ſaid here to anſwer, becauſe (as it was prayed) he now took the matter into his own hand, and in perſon (as I may ſay) argued the Caſe with <hi>Job,</hi> and finally determined his Cauſe.</p>
                  <p>Hence Note;
<q>The wiſhes, requeſts, and prayers of good men have ſometimes been heard, though they were over-bold in making them, or had no clear ground to make them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Job</hi> had no rule for ſuch a Petition, that he might preſently have a trial at the Tribunal of God; yet God was ſo gracious as to anſwer him in it, not onely to his reproof, but to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. The Name of God is, <hi>O thou that heareſt prayer,</hi> (Pſal. 65.2.) If carnal men have their extravagant prayers and wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es granted, 'tis in wrath; but if the Lord grant the paſſionate pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48669:14"/> and wiſhes of a godly man, it proves, though ſometimes a preſent affliction, yet alwayes, upon one account or other, a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in the iſſue. When the luſting <hi>Iſraelites</hi> wiſht for fleſh, the Lord heard their wiſhes; take Quails your bellies full, till they come out at your noſtrils; <hi>but while the meat was in their mouths, the wrath of God fell upon them.</hi> If the Lord grants what luſt asketh, ſuch pay dear for what they have for the asking. It hath been an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently ſaid,<note place="margin">Multi irato deo exaudiuntur.</note> 
                     <hi>many have their prayers heard in meer anger;</hi> ſo are all theirs who pray for what they have not, in meer diſcontent with what they have. The Lord heard <hi>Job,</hi> and not in anger, but in favour and condeſcention to him. Now if ſome not well grounded nor warranted requeſts of good men may be granted and anſwered (the Lord pitying their weakneſs, and eyeing their uprightneſs) in favour; how much more may they be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that their gracious and humble requeſts, ſuch requeſts as are every way ſutable to the Word and Will of God, ſhall be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly anſwered!</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Lord anſwered, as the Prayer and Wiſh, ſo the Complaints of <hi>Job;</hi> He had complained ſometimes (though he were a mirror of patience) impatiently. Theſe complaints the Lord anſwered, but it was with ſevere and ſharp reproofs, as we find in the next verſe.</p>
                  <p>To conclude this query, we may ſay, God had two great ends or deſigns in anſwering both the wiſhes and complaints of <hi>Job.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, That he might humble and convince him, that he might ſtop his mouth and ſilence his complainings for ever, as he did moſt effectually.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That after his humiliation, and repentance, he might juſtifie and acquit him, and alſo reſtore him to his former comforts and enjoyments, as he did moſt mercifully. This being the deſign of the Lord in ſpeaking to <hi>Job,</hi> what he ſaid, may well be called an Anſwer.</p>
                  <p>But how or in what manner did the Lord anſwer him? Surely, in ſuch a manner, as never man was anſwered. <hi>The Lord anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Job</hi>
                     <q>Out of the Whirlwind.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He anſwered him (as we ſay) to ſome Tune. A Whirlwind
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48669:14" rendition="simple:additions"/> makes ſtrange kind of Muſick. A Whirlwind is a ſudden mighty loud-bluſtring Wind, taking away, or bearing down all before it. A Whirlwind is a Wind which moves whirling, and gyring about all the points of the Compaſs, no man knows where to have it, nor how to ſhelter himſelf from it. I have had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſpeak of the Wind, and of the natural ordinary Whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind in the former Chapter. But here's a Whirlwind extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, if not ſupernatural. There's much queſtioning among ſome Interpreters how we are to conceive of this Whirlwind. I would anſwer that point a little, and then give ſome account, why the Lord ſpake to <hi>Job</hi> out of ſuch a Whirlwind.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Some affirm that it was onely a Viſional Whirlwind: As if the Lord appeared (as it were) in a Tempeſt or Whirlwind to <hi>Job</hi> in a deep ſleep, ſuch as was upon <hi>Adam</hi> (Gen. 2.21.) when the Lord took one of his ribs, and made the Woman. In ſuch a deep ſleep, ſay they, <hi>Job</hi> ſaw a Whirlwind, and heard the Lord ſpeaking to him out of it: As <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> who in a Viſion <hi>looked, and behold a Whirlwind came</hi> out of the North; as we read in the firſt Chapter of that Propheſie, (<hi>verſe</hi> 4.)</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Others conceive that it was not a Viſional, but a Metaphorical Whirlwind, or a Whirlwind in a figure; and we may give you a threefold Metaphor, or three things, to which this paſſage of Providence may allude to a ſpeaking out of a Whirlwind.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> God <hi>anſwered Job out of the Whirlwind;</hi> that is, when there was a great busſle or ſtorm among the Diſputants, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting about <hi>Jobs</hi> caſe; one moving this way, another thar, all being toſſed about (as it were) with the wind of their ſeveral opinions in ventitalating his condition. Out of this Whirlwind it was (ſay ſome) or while all were thus diſcompoſed in their ſpirits, and could not compoſe the matter in difference between them and <hi>Job,</hi> during this hurry or troubleſome ſtate of things and minds, the Lord aroſe and anſwered <hi>Job.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Lord may be ſaid to anſwer <hi>Job</hi> out of the Whirlwind, becauſe he ſpake to him angrily, diſpleaſedly, and reprovingly. Anger, eſpecially the Lords Anger or Diſpleaſure, is often in Scripture compared to a Storm or Tempeſt: As if this Whirlwind were nothing elſe but a ſharp angry chiding. When a man chides, we ſay, <hi>The man's in a ſtorm;</hi> and we may
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48669:15"/> ſay with reverence, when the Lord ſpeaks chidingly (as he did to <hi>Job</hi>) he is in a ſtorm, or (according to the Text) ſpeakes out of a Sto my Whirlwind: Thus alſo, when the Lord ſpeaks plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingly, and gently, then he may be ſaid to ſpeak in a calm. There's a truth in that.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Lord anſwered in a Whirlwind; that is, while <hi>Job,</hi> both as to his outward condition and inward diſpoſition, or the frame of his ſpirit, was evidently in a great ſtorm or toſs. For doubtleſs, his ſpirit was very ſtormy and toſſed up and down at that time, that is, much troubled and diſquieted, upon the with-drawings of God, and the unkindneſs of his friends. Now when <hi>Job</hi> had this Sto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>m, this Whirlwind in his ſpirit, the Lord appeared and anſwered him. Thus ſome conceive it, though not a Viſional Whirlwind, yet a Metaphorical Whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind in thoſe three ſenſes opened. But</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, (with others) I take the Whirlwind here in proper ſenſe, that is, for ſuch a Whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                     </note> One of the Rabbins calls it <hi>a dark cloud;</hi> ſeveral of the Moderns expreſs it by a rainy or watry cloud, out of which iſſued that dreadful Storm, called a Whirlwind. Doubtleſs, ſome ſudden extraordinary Wind, exceeding the conſtant order and common courſe of Nature, gathered the clouds at that time. Thus God at once hid the glory of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and teſtified it (much after the ſame manner as he did at the promulgation of the Law upon Mount <hi>Sinai) when he anſwered Job out of the Whirlwind.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But it may be queſtioned, why did God <hi>anſwer Job out of a Whirlwind?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, Such a way of anſwering was moſt proper to the diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of thoſe Old Teſtament Times, when the Covenant of Grace lay covered with Legal Shadows, and was uſually admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred in a clothing or ſhew of terror; eſpecially (as was ſaid before) at the giving of the Law on Mount <hi>Sinai (Exod.</hi> 19. <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.12.) when, <hi>ſo terrible was the ſight,</hi> that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid, <hi>I exceedingly fear and quake</hi> (Heb. 12.21.) And ſurely the Lord appeared and ſpake very dreadfully to ſome of the Prophets in thoſe Elder Times; eſpecially to the Prophet <hi>Habakkuk,</hi> who thus reports
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48669:15"/> the conſternation of his mind (<hi>chap.</hi> 3.16.) <hi>When I heard, my belly trembled, my lips quivered at the voice, rottenneſs entred into my bones, and I trembled in my ſelf, that I might reſt in the day of trouble.</hi> Now, Goſpel Times being more clear and calm, Chriſt ſpeaks more clearly and calmly; as it was phopheſied (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.2, 3.) <hi>He ſhall not cry nor lift up his voice in the ſtreet:</hi> (Chriſt did not ſpeak out of a Whirlwind) <hi>A bruiſed reed he ſhall not break, and the ſmoaking flax ſhall he not quench; he ſhall bring forth Judgement unto Victory:</hi> That is, he ſhall with all tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs condeſcend to the weakeſt ſouls, and deal with them moſt ſweetly, gently, and compaſſionately.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Lord ſpake in a Whirlwind, that he might ſhew the greater State and Majeſty, to awaken <hi>Job</hi> yet more, or to make him more attentive; as alſo to affect him yet more deeply with the apprehenſion of his Power and Glory; and to leave a greater impreſſion upon his ſpirit of his own vileneſs, weakneſs, and nothingneſs. <hi>Job</hi> was yet too big in his own eyes, the Lord would annihilate or make him nothing; the Lord would beat him out of all conceit with himſelf, out of an opinion of his own integrity and righteouſneſs, that he might ſee and confeſs there was no way but to lie at his foot, abhorring himſelf, and repenting in duſt and aſhes. Such to this day is the pride and ſtupidneſs of mans fleſh, that he hardly attends the Word or Works of God, unleſs awed by ſome extraordinary Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, We may conceive the Lord appeared and ſpake in this Whirlwind,<note place="margin">Aerumnoſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini conformem exhibens aſpo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ctum. <hi>Munſt.</hi>
                     </note> that he might therein ſuit his appearance to the ſtate and condition of <hi>Job</hi> at that time, or that he might (as it were) ſymbolize with <hi>Jobs</hi> troubled eſtate. <hi>Job,</hi> as I toucht be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, was in a Storm, and now God declares himſelf in a ſtorm: and that is the reaſon, which ſome give, why the Lord appeared to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> (Exod. 3.2.) in a burning buſh; it was (ſay they) that his appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rition might anſwer their preſent condition. The Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were then in the fire of affliction, and entangled in the buſh of cruel bondage, they were ſcratcht and torn with briars and thorns; and the Lord ſpake out of a burning buſh to <hi>Moſes,</hi> as here to <hi>Job</hi> out of the Whirlwind.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, and laſtly; I conceive the reaſon why the Lord ſpake o him in a Storm, or Whirlwind, was to let him know that he
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48669:16"/> was not well pleaſed with him, but purpoſed to reprove and chide him.<note place="margin">De turbine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignationis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice.</note> Though <hi>Job</hi> was a precious ſervant of God, yet God was not well pleaſed with many paſſages under his affliction, and therefore he would not flatter but humble him: For though <hi>Job</hi> ſpake from an honeſt heart, and what he ſaid was truth, yet God did not like his manner of defence and pleading for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: He was not pleaſed to ſee him hold up the Bucklers ſo long, when he ſhould have laid them down rather, and ſubmitted. <hi>David</hi> to ſhew how greatly the Lord was diſpleaſed with his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, tells us what dreadful effects followed the hearing and granting of his prayer againſt them, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.7, 8, 9, <hi>&amp;c.) Then the Earth ſhook and trembled, the foundations alſo of the hills moved and were ſhaken, becauſe he was wroth; there went a ſmoke out of his noſtrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured, coals alſo were kindled by it: he bowed the Heavens alſo and came down, and darkneſs was under his feet, &amp;c.</hi> Thus the Lord appeared in an Earthquake, in ſmoke, in fire, and darkneſſe, to make the proud oppoſers of his faithful Servant <hi>David,</hi> know how much his anger was kindled againſt them. Thus alſo when the Lord revealed himſelf to <hi>Elijah</hi> (1 Kings 19.11.) its ſaid, <hi>a great and ſtrong wind rent the mountains and brake the rocks; and after the wind, an Earthquake; and after the Earthquake, a fire,</hi> before the <hi>ſtill voice was heard:</hi> And why all this, but to ſhew that the Lord was highly diſpleaſed with the doings of the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> at that time, and with that idolatrous generation; therefore he appeared in ſuch a dreadful manner, while he purpoſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all in a ſtill voice. Though the Lord was not in the Wind, in the Earthquake, nor in the Fire, yet theſe were fore-runners of his appearance, and ſignified that the Lord would ſhake that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with a mighty Wind and Earthquake of Judgement, yea e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven conſume them with the fire of his wrathful jealouſie, for their ſuperſtitious following after <hi>Baal,</hi> and deſerting his appointed Worſhip. When the luſts of wicked men grow fiery and ſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, God will convince them with fire and ſtormes; and if his own ſervants grow too bold with him, he will make them ſenſible of it, as here he did <hi>Job,</hi> by ſpeaking to them out of a Whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind; though he be intended to ſpeak to them at laſt as he did to <hi>Elijah,</hi> in a <hi>ſtill voice,</hi> and to <hi>Job,</hi> with favour and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation.</p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:48669:16"/>
                  <p>Thus much for the opening of theſe words, <hi>Then the Lord an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered Job out of the Whirlwind, and ſaid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence Obſerve;
<q>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> The great goodneſs of God, who condeſcends or lets himſelf down to ſpeak and treat with duſt and aſhes!</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>What a wonder is it, that the Lord of Heaven and Earth, ſhould admit, and enter into a parly with man, who is but a well-ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped clod of Earth! <hi>Solomon</hi> was in a kind of amazement at the mercy, when he ſaid at the Dedication of the Temple (1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.22.) <hi>But will God indeed dwell on Earth!</hi> And may not we, that God ſhould come down to confer with an afflicted bed-rid man on Earth! I know ſome are of opinion, that the Lord ſpake by an Angel to <hi>Job;</hi> however, here was the Lords preſence, it was <hi>Jehovah,</hi> who manifeſted himſelf to <hi>Job,</hi> what Miniſtry ſoever he uſed: Thus the Lord is pleaſed often to interpoſe in the caſe and cauſe of his afflicted ſervants, though we ſee him not, nor have ſuch formal apparitions, as here in the Text. <hi>The Lord, the high and lofty One, who dwelleth in the high and holy Place, dwelleth alſo with him that is of a contrite and humble ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;</hi> and be dwelleth with him <hi>to revive him, (Iſa.</hi> 57.15.) Therefore ſurely he manifeſts himſelf to him in his loving-kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which is better than life, and the very life of our lives. <hi>The Lord who hath Heaven for his Throne, and the Earth his foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtool,</hi> ſaith by the ſame prophet (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.1, 2.) <hi>To this man will I look,</hi> (and leſt any ſhould take this man to be one of the mighty ones of this world, he giveth us both a ſignal ſpecification, and clear character of this man to whom he looketh) <hi>even to him that is poor, and of a contrite ſpirit, and that trembleth at my Word.</hi> And if the Lord look to ſuch a man, if he vouchſafe him his gracious <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ye, doubtleſs he alſo reveals himſelf graciouſly and freely to him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Lord came here to inſtruct and teach <hi>Job.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral perſons had dealt with him before, and they very worthy, good, and learned perſons, and they came with a purpoſe to do him good; yet all would not do: All that his three friends ſaid, who undertook him firſt in their turns, was to little purpoſe in appearance. And though <hi>Elihu,</hi> a ſpritely young man, diſcours'd him with much life and heat, yet neither could he do the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48669:17"/> 
                     <hi>Jobs</hi> ſpirit began indeed to yeeld upon the laſt engagement of <hi>Elihu</hi> with him; yet he did not convince him fully. God came at laſt, and he prevailed, he did the deed; <hi>Then the Lord anſwered Job.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence Note,
<q>We need the teachings of God, beſides all the teachings of men, that we may rightly know him, and our ſelves, together with the intendment of his dealings with us, and our own duty un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis <hi>the</hi> mercy of the New Covenant, that we ſhall be taught of God, and not by man onely nor alone. As here <hi>Job</hi> had three or four, ſo we may have thrice three men toyling with us a long time in vain. The work is never well done, till God comes; and though we have not ſuch appearances of God now, yet he doth the ſame thing in effect to this day. This and that man, a thouſand men, yea a man who is an Interpreter, one of a thouſand (as <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpake) may be labouring upon the conſcience of a ſinner, and never bring things home either to convince or comfort him, till God is pleaſed to come in by the power of his bleſſed Spirit, and then who can but be convinced and comforted! Hence our Lord Chriſt had no ſooner reported the Covenant Promiſe out of the Prophet, <hi>They ſhall be all taught of God</hi> (John 6.45.) but preſently he makes this inference from it, <hi>Every man therefore that hath heard and hath learned of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, cometh unto me.</hi> We may ſay to all who are ſavingly wrought upon, as Chriſt to <hi>Peter,</hi> upon that Confeſſion which he made (<hi>Matth.</hi> 16.16. <hi>Thou art Chriſt, the Son of the Living God) Fleſh and blood hath not revealed this to you, but your Father which is in Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Impoſſibile eſt deum diſcere ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne deo. <hi>Iraen.</hi> l. <hi>4. adverſus Haret.</hi> c. <hi>10.</hi> A deo diſcendum quicquid de deo intelligendum. <hi>Hilar.</hi> l. <hi>5. de Trin.</hi>
                     </note>It was ſaid by one of the Ancients, <hi>it is impoſſible to know God without God.</hi> And ſo ſaid another, <hi>We muſt learn all that from God which we underſtand of God.</hi> Unleſs God be our Tutor, we ſhall never be good Scholars. We know neither God nor our ſelves, any further than God teacheth us. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Be not called Maſters, for one is your Maſter, even Chriſt</hi> (Matth. 23.8.) There are two ſorts of Maſters. 1. Ruling or Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Maſters. 2. Teaching Maſters. To the former we are Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, to the latter we are Scholars. In the eighth verſe Chriſt
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48669:17"/> ſpeaks of Teaching Maſters, as of Ruling Maſters at the tenth verſe. Now, when Chriſt would not have any man take upon him, or own the Title of Maſter or Teacher, his meaning is, that no man ſhould arrogate to himſelf the honour of principal Teacher, which is the peculiar of God: but to acknowledge that all mans teaching is nothing without Gods; as the Apoſtle alſo ſaith (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.) We muſt learn from God whatever we know aright, either of God, or of our ſelves. <hi>Eliphaz, Bildad,</hi> and <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phar,</hi> ſpake much of God to <hi>Job,</hi> but <hi>Job</hi> was never effectually humbled, till God ſpake.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Note;
<q>As God here by his Word, ſo alwayes the Word of God, is the true determiner of controverſies, and reſolver of doubts.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>No queſtion can be truly ſtated, but by the Word of God.<note place="margin">Rectum eſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex ſui &amp; obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui.</note> As <hi>the ſtatutes of the Lord are right (Pſal.</hi> 19.8.) So they ſhew what is right, and what is not. A ſtrait Rule declares it ſelf to be ſtrait, and detects the crookedneſs of whatſoever is crooked. The laſt appeal in all things doubtful is to the Law, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.20.) <hi>To the Law, and to the Teſtimony; if they ſpeak not according to this Word, it is becauſe there is no light,</hi> or (as the Margin hath it) <hi>no morning in them.</hi> The Sun of righteouſneſs hath not riſen upon them who ſpeak and hold unrighteous things. <hi>Search the Scriptures,</hi> ſaith Chriſt (<hi>John</hi> 5.39.) or, as 'tis well rendred in the Indicative Mood, <hi>Ye ſearch the Scriptures, for in them ye think ye have eternal life.</hi> Nor did they think amiſs in thinking ſo; but that which Chriſt ſecretly reproved, while he ſaid ſo, was, that they did amiſs, or contradicted the Scripture in their lives, while they boaſtingly thought ſo. Not what this or that man ſaith, but what God ſaith, is the true ground of mans faith.<note place="margin">Sumamus exli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bris divinitus inſpiratis ſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num. <hi>Theod.</hi> l. <hi>1.

                     </note> It was a worthy ſpeech of <hi>Conſtantine in the Nicene Council, Let us take out of that Book divinely inſpired, the ſolution of our Queſtions.</hi> It is not what the Fathers ſay, nor what the Pope ſaith, nor what Councils ſay; but what the Word of God ſaith, that muſt be heard and relied upon for ſalvation. The Word is the Judge, that is the rule of Judgement. As here, God was the perſonal Judge of this, ſo his Word muſt ever be the Normal Judge of all controverſies.</p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:48669:18"/>
                  <p>Fourthly, Note;
<q>The Day of Judgment is like to be a terrible day.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here was a little day of Judgement, here God came to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine a matter between <hi>Job</hi> and his three friends, and that was a terrible day; in it we have an image or repreſentation of the laſt Judgement Day; God appeared in a Storm, in a Whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind: what think you will be the Lords appearance, when he comes to judge the whole World! The Pſalmiſt ſpeaking of ſome particular day of Judgement which ſhould fore-run the general judgement, ſets it forth in dreadful Metaphors (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.3, 4.) <hi>Our God</hi> (Theſe are the words of Gods faithful ſervants, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring themſelves of a gracious deliverance from the cruelty of wicked men, by the goodneſs and mighty arme of God; <hi>Our God,</hi> ſay they) <hi>ſhall come,</hi> that is, he ſhall certainly come, though he ſeem for a while to defer and put off his coming; <hi>and ſhall not keep ſilence</hi> (as he hath been thought to do, either in not anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the prayers of his people, or in not puniſhing the preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of his and their enemies, as he alſo ſaid he did at the 21th verſe of this Pſalme) and then woe to the wicked, for, <hi>A fire ſhall devour before him</hi> (God will then appear as a conſuming fire) <hi>and a mighty tempeſt</hi> (of wrath and indignation) <hi>round about him;</hi> (ſo that there can be no eſcape either before or behind, on one ſide or the other: And then (<hi>v.</hi> 4.) <hi>He ſhall call to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens from above, and to the Earth;</hi> that is, to the heavenly and earthly Powers, as witneſſes againſt the ungodly, and as aids and aſſiſtants, <hi>that they may judge his people,</hi> that is, aſſert their integrity and maintain them in it. Now (I ſay) if there have been or ſhall be ſuch dreadful appearances of God in this world, for the vindication of his people, and the avenging of them upon their enemies; what will his appearance be, when in the end of the world <hi>he ſhall come</hi> (as the Apoſtle <hi>Jade</hi> ſpeaks (<hi>v.</hi> 14, 15. of his Epiſtle) <hi>with ten thouſand of his ſaints, to execute judgement upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them, of all their ungodly deeds, which they have ungodlily committed, and of all their hard ſpeeches, which ungodly ſinners have ſpoken againſt him;</hi> That is, either directly, or reflexively, in letting their tongues looſe to ſpeak againſt them. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> having ſaid (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10.) <hi>We muſt all appear before the Judgement Seat
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48669:18"/> of Chriſt, that every one may receive the things,</hi> (that is, the fruit of the things) <hi>done in his body,</hi> (that is, while he was in the body) <hi>whether it be good or bad;</hi> he adds at the eleventh verſe, <hi>Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we perſwade men.</hi> As if he had ſaid, We know that will be a terrible day, Chriſt will come and anſwer ſinners out of a Whirlwind, when he comes to Judgement; and therefore <hi>We</hi> (being fully perſwaded of this our ſelves) <hi>perſwade men</hi> by all means to beleeve and repent, and get the peace of their ſouls well and ſurely ſetled upon good Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel terms in this world, that ſo they may find peace in the great Day of Judgement, which will be the commencement or begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of another world. They who know the terror of the Lord will both perſwade others, and be perſwaded themſelves to look after reconciliation with God, that when Chriſt cometh terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, they may appear before him comfortably, or that he may not be a terror unto them in that day.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Foraſmuch as the Lord anſwered <hi>Job</hi> out of the Whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind (as was ſaid) to affect him with the awe and reverence of his great Name, while he was ſpeaking,</p>
                  <p>Obſerve;
<q>The Word of God is to be heard with reverence, with fear and trembling, or with an holy awe of God upon our hearts.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Why did the Lord ſpeak out of a Whirlwind? Surely, that <hi>Job</hi> might ſee his diſtance, or that he was but as a feather, even <hi>like a rolling thing, or thiſtle-down, before the Whirl-wind,</hi> which the Lord could ſcatter and blow away with the leaſt breath of his mouth, as that alluſion in the Prophet intimates (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 17.13.) And queſtionleſs all the wicked in the world, who contemn the Word of God preached by his Miniſters,<note place="margin">Locutione do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini blanda dulcedo ejus o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtenditur, per tempeſtatem vero poteſtas ejus metuenda monſtratur. <hi>Greg. l. 28.</hi> c. <hi>2.</hi>
                     </note> will be blown away by it as thiſtle-down or a rolling thing before the Whirl-wind of the Lords fierce anger and diſpleaſure; All ſuch ſhall be carried away with a ſtrong irreſiſtable wind, and caſt into the bottomleſs pit of perdition for ever. The Lord who ſometimes ſpeaks out of a Whirl-wind, hath a whirl-wind alwayes at his command to ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thoſe like chaffe, who obey not what is ſpoken, as he threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the enemies of <hi>Jacob (Iſa.</hi> 41.16.)</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, From <hi>Gods ſpeaking out of the Whirlwind,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:48669:19"/>
                  <p>Note;
<q>God is preſent with his in troublous diſpenſations.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis no argument, that God is not with us, when ſtorms and whirl-winds are up, whether with reſpect to Nations and Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, or particular Perſons. Do not think God is gone becauſe there is a ſtorm. Read (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 18. <hi>v.</hi> 6, 7, 8. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23.4. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.15. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.2, 3.) and you ſhall find that in the worſt appearances the Lord is preſent. The Prophet ſpeaks it expreſly (<hi>Nahum</hi> 1.3.) <hi>The Lord hath his way in the Whirl-wind, and in the ſtorm, and the Clouds are the duſt of his feet.</hi> When and where it's dark and troubleſom the Lord is there, and there he is moſt; that's the Prophets meaning alſo, when he ſaith, <hi>The Clouds are the duſt of his feet.</hi> By Clouds we may underſtand, not ſo much the Clouds of the Air, as cloudy Providences; theſe are round about him, while Judgment and Juſtice, yea while Mercy and Goodneſs are the habitation of his Throne. And theſe Clouds may be called <hi>the duſt of his feet</hi> in a Figure; we know where Travellers paſs of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, their feet make a duſt; now it ſhews that the Lord doth act much in the Clouds, that is in dark Providences, becauſe 'tis ſaid, <hi>They are the dust of his feet,</hi> as if he moved ſo much and ſo long in them, that he raiſed a duſt with his motion. Do not think the Lord is gone, when whirl-winds and ſtorms, that is outward troubles, come. The Lord anſwers out of the whirl-wind as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as he anſwers us <hi>by terrible things in Righteouſneſs;</hi> and thus he often anſwers us (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 65.5.)</p>
                  <p>Seaventhly, and Laſtly, comparing the manner of Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſpeaking to <hi>Job,</hi> with his intent in coming and ſpeaking to him.

                  <p>What more dreadful than a Whirle-wind? yet <hi>Job</hi> found this ſtorme uſhering in a ſweet calme and a moſt comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table

When <hi>Jacob</hi> was in a ſtormy condition, becauſe of his brother <hi>Eſau,</hi> then the Lord came to him (<hi>Gen.</hi> 32.) but how came he to him? one would have thought, that <hi>Jacob</hi> being in ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, the Lord who came to comfort him, would have taken him by the hand and embraced him, or walkt aſide with him, and told him, I am come to help thee, and deliver thee; be of good cheer, let not thy heart be troubled at the approach of thy bloody bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for I am with thee.

                  <p>This Verſe and ths next are a Preface to what God had further to ſay unto his afflicted ſervant <hi>Job.</hi> The former verſe was the Hiſtorians Preface, theſe two are the Lords.</p>
                  <q>Who is this that darkeneth counſel by words without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge?</q>
                  <p>We have here, Firſt, A check lighting ſomewhere, <hi>Who is this?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, We have the matter for which this perſon is checkt, and that is <hi>for darkening counſel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, We have that by which he is charged to have dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned counſel, and that is, <hi>By words without knowledge;</hi> and his ignorance or want of knowledge is implied, as diſcovered in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or rather complaining ſo much concerning his own ſufferings, and the ſeverity of Gods dealings with him, whereby he had at once caſt a cloud upon the Juſtice, and reflected upon the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and mercy of God.</p>
                  <q>Whos is this?</q>
                  <p>The words may be taken, Firſt, as a bare enquiry after he man, <hi>Who is this?</hi> what man is this? as <hi>Saul</hi> ſpake of <hi>David</hi> after the victory which he had got over <hi>Goliah, Whoſe ſon is this youth?</hi> (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.55.) but that I conceive is too flat and lean a ſenſe in this place, as if the Lord did only make enquiry af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the man. Therefore,</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Theſe words, <hi>Who is this?</hi> carry in them a rebuke, who is it that hath done this? As if God pointing at <hi>Job,</hi> had ſaid, is it you? I could not have believed that my ſervant <hi>Job</hi> would have ſo much forgotten himſelf, or have been ſo bold with me, as to reflect upon my juſt, though ſevere proceedings, by his weak reaſonings, which faith only can make him underſtand aright. Such Queſtions in Scripture often carry a rebuke in them, yea,</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, more then a rebuke, they carry a ſlight or contempt of the perſon about whom the queſtion is put. As when men pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume (as ſome blaſphemouſly have done) to ſay, <hi>Who is the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48669:20"/> Lord? What is the Almighty that we ſhould ſerve him?</hi> they ſpeak contemptuouſly and ſlightingly of God: So when God ſpeaks thus to man, who is this? he may be ſaid to ſpeak ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly of man. Again, as when man, ſpeaking of himſelf, ſaith (as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8.4.) <hi>What is man that thou art mindful of him!</hi> he ſlights or vilifies himſelf; ſo when the Lord ſaith, who is this? or who is the other? it carryeth the ſame ſenſe. Interrogations are quick ſharp ſpeeches, and uſually thoſe ſpeeches are quick and ſharp which begin with an Interrogation; and doubtleſs this Interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation hath a double ſharpneſs, or two ſtings in it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Of rebuke or reprehenſion.<note place="margin">Forma ipſa in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogationis, qua nullum ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>primitur pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prium nomen ſolet ad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptum perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere &amp; expro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brationem.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Of a ſlight or diminution. <hi>Job,</hi> though indeed a man of an excellent ſpirit, had been too bold with God, and therefore no wonder if God ſpake (though he contemned him not) contemningly to him, <hi>Who is this?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet here it is queſtioned who the perſon was, whether <hi>Job</hi> or no, that is aimed at or intended in this rebuking or contemning Queſtion.</p>
                  <p>There are two opinions about it, and the matter is carried on both ſides (as one expreſſeth it) by no inconſiderable Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Some conceive, <hi>Elihu</hi> was the perſon concerned in this Queſtion, <hi>Who is this?</hi> and they give ſeveral reaſons for it; I ſhall only mention two. Firſt, becauſe he was the man that ſpake laſt; we had him ſpeaking ſix Chapters quite through, while <hi>Job</hi> ſpake not a word; and therefore ſay they, it ſeems moſt probable, that when God came to ſpeak, he would undertake him that ſpake laſt. <hi>Who is this?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Becauſe <hi>Elihu</hi> had not carryed the matter ſo clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and fully with <hi>Job</hi> as he ſhould, but had failed, though not as <hi>Jobs</hi> three friends had done before; and that therefore as the Lord reproved and taxed them by name in the 42d Chapter, ſo here <hi>Elihu</hi> is taxed more covertly, for obſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>uring his Counſel, <hi>Who is this that darkeneth counſel by words without knowledge?</hi> Theſe are the two chief Arguments which faſten the rebuke upon <hi>Elihu;</hi> and there are many learned Interpreters who carry it ſo, affirming that the whole diſcourſe from the beginning of this 38th Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the end of the 39th is directed to <hi>Elihu;</hi> and that God ſpake not to <hi>Job</hi> till the 40th Chapter. Yet ſome others ſay
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:48669:21"/> God reproved <hi>Elihu</hi> in this ſecond Verſe only, and ſpake comfort to <hi>Job</hi> in the third; <hi>Gird up thy loins like a man;</hi> and theſe inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret the firſt words of the Chapter, <hi>Then the Lord anſwered Job cut of the Whirl-wind,</hi> thus, he anſwered for <hi>Job,</hi> not to <hi>Job,</hi> as if the word <hi>Job</hi> were to be taken in the dative Caſe, ſignifying favour and reſpect from God to him.</p>
                  <p>But, by the favour of theſe learned Authors, who give this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, I ſhall rather adhere to thoſe who affirm (and they are not a few) that the perſon here concerned and ſpoken to was <hi>Job</hi> himſelf, and I ſhall give you three or four Reaſons of it, and ſo paſs to the opening of the words.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe the firſt Verſe tells us expreſly, that the <hi>Lord anſwered Job out of the whirlwind;</hi> and that Interpretation which ſaith, he anſwered for, not to <hi>Job,</hi> is a little ſtrain to the Text. Now the Lord ſpeaking ſo expreſly to <hi>Job</hi> in the firſt Verſe, it is very congruous, that he ſhould ſpeak to him in the ſecond, and not divert his ſpeech from him to another perſon in the next words that he ſpake.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Job</hi> himſelf took theſe words to himſelf in the forty ſecond Chapter, at the third Verſe, where he acknowledged that indeed he had ſpoken darkly, <hi>I have uttered things that I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood not, things too wonderful for me, which I knew not;</hi> he took (I ſay) the reproof contained or couched in thoſe words to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, which is a clear argument, that they were directed to him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If we conſider the whole frame of the Lords diſcourſe afterwards, beyond this preface, we ſhall find that he is not ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for <hi>Job</hi> againſt <hi>Elihu,</hi> but for <hi>Elihu</hi> againſt <hi>Job,</hi> that is to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Job;</hi> and therefore the Lord doth joyn in with <hi>Elihu,</hi> and uſeth the very ſame Arguments in the main (as will appear in opening the Chapter) which <hi>Elihu</hi> had inſiſted upon, namely from the works of God in the Creation, and his wonderful wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in ordering thoſe works in Providence. So that the dealing of God with <hi>Job</hi> in theſe Chapters (as to the ſubject matter of it) very conſentaneous or like to the matter which <hi>Elihu</hi> had handled and inſiſted upon, eſpecially in the later part of his ſpeech to <hi>Job;</hi> and therefore it doth not ſeem probable that God would reprove him for what he had ſpoken.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the manner of this rebuke ſeems to fit <hi>Job</hi> very fully,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48669:21"/> for therein he is not charged with any falſity or groſs miſtake (he indeed having ſpoken of God and the things of God, of his own innocency and piety, with the rewards of both, truly and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily) but onely with obſcuring and darkning the things which he had uttered. His ſpeech bearing much of the Image of his own troubled ſpirit and troubleſom condition, was ſomewhat troubled and confuſed. Therefore I conclude that the perſon ſpoken to and reproved in this ſecond verſe was <hi>Job,</hi> not <hi>Elihu; Who is this that darkeneth counſel by words without knowledge?</hi> and it being reſolved that he was the man, let me (before I proceed to the matter of this reproof) give out this brief Obſervation.</p>
                  <p>We have heard at the eighth Verſe of the firſt Chapter, how God ſpake of <hi>Job,</hi> and now conſider how God ſpeaks to <hi>Job;</hi> There the Lord approved him highly, as not having his like or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond on earth for well-doing; here the Lord reproved him ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for undue-ſpeaking.</p>
                  <p>Hence Note;
<q>As God will not conceal the praiſes of his ſervants when they do well, ſo he will not conceal their faults, nor forbear to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them, when they either do or ſpeak amiſs.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>When Satan came upon that ſolemn day, and ſtood before the Lord, God ſaid unto him, <hi>Haſt that conſidered my ſervant Job, that there's none like him in all the earth, a man perfect and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right; ſo perfect and upright both in his walking with me, and in his dealing with man, that he hath not his fellow?</hi> Thus God ſpake of him as to his former ſtate. But now after <hi>Job</hi> had ſpoken long in this diſpute, and had let fall ſome unwary and unbecoming ſpeeches, ſee how God ſpeakes to him, <hi>Who is this?</hi> as if he had been a man ſcarce worth the naming or ſpeaking to. God will not flatter his Servants; if they do or ſpeak what is not right, they are like to hear of it. Wherein he had ſpoken what was not right, or what his fault was, appeares in the next words, <hi>Who is this</hi>
                     <q>That darkeneth counſel by words without knowledge?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Words againſt knowledge are the worſt words that can be ſpoken; the Lord did not charge <hi>Job</hi> thus far: words without knowledge are very bad, and thus far the Lord charged the words of <hi>Job,</hi> as alſo with that which is an unavoidable effect of ſuch words,

                  <p>Secondly, The Counſel which he darkened, was (ſay others) the Counſel of God, or his purpoſe and intendment in the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the righteous, and in ſuffering the wicked to proſper for a ſeaſon. Theſe works of God are a great ſecret, and therefore may well be expreſſed by the word <hi>Counſel.</hi>

                     </note> And uſually when the word <hi>Counſel</hi> is put abſolutely and alone, it is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of the Counſel of God. Yet I conceive we may very well joyn theſe two opinions together, and ſay, <hi>Job</hi> darkened his own counſel and the counſel of God too; he delivered his own mind and ſentiments ſo darkly (the delivering of a mans mind is his counſel) about the counſel of God, that he rather obſcured both, than cleared either. And there are ſeveral things wherein <hi>Job</hi> may be charged to have ſpoken obſcurely. Did he not darken the counſel of God, when he complained ſo very much and ſo often of his afflictions? Did he not darken his own counſel, and the counſel of God, when, as if the diſpenſations of God were every where alike to all, he ſaid (<hi>Chap.</hi> 9.22.) <hi>God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyeth the perfect and the wicked. If the ſcourge ſlay ſuddenly, he

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, as with an enemy? Surely he did not well attend the counſel of God in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting him, while he made ſuch conſtructions of his affliction. The things which <hi>Job</hi> ſpake were true, yet <hi>Job</hi> delivered himſelf ſo darkly that his friends miſ-underſtood him; they underſtood him, as if he meant that God dealt in his providences with the righteous as with the wicked, and were to the wicked as he is to the righteous, that is, as if he had no more regard to any godly man, than to a wicked man in afflicting him. In theſe (and ſome other things) <hi>Job</hi> did not ſufficiently explaine himſelf and he exceedingly ſtumbled or offended his friends and hearers, and ſo might be ſaid to darken the counſel of God, that is the purpoſe of God, or what God hath in his counſels concerning his people, when under his afflicting hand. All ſuch like paſſages fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from <hi>Job,</hi> the Lord might call a darkening of his counſel, or the caſting of a cloud upon his righteous dealings, and at leaſt an intimation that God had done him wrong. Words of ſuch a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and tendency are juſtly charged to be <hi>words</hi>
                     <q>Without knowledge.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Not that <hi>Job</hi> ſpake altogether ignorantly, underſtanding neither what he ſaid, nor whereof he affirmed, as the Apoſtle charged ſome, who deſired to be teachers of the Law (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.7.) the Text cannot be ſo taken; but his words and affirmations were ſuch as did not hold out a clear light of knowledge, either in his own underſtanding, or at leaſt not to the underſtanding of his hearers. Thus <hi>Elihu</hi> charged <hi>Job (Chap.</hi> 35.16.) <hi>He openeth his mouth in vain, he multipileth words without knowledge.</hi> To ſpeak one word without knowledge is too many; what is it then to multiply words without knowledge? <hi>He multiplieth words without knowledge,</hi> that is, he hath not given his ſenſe and meaning in many things clearly, as he might and ſhould. Here the Lord ſeems to take up the ſame charge againſt <hi>Job; Who is this that darkeneth counſel by words without knowledge?</hi> God conſents with <hi>Elihu,</hi> as to the matter of his reproof; <hi>Elihu</hi> telling him, that <hi>he had multiplied words with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowledge;</hi> and God telling him, that <hi>he had darkened coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel by words without kowledge.</hi> Words ought to give light to the things we ſpeak of or about; what we ſpeak ſhould be for the

                  <p>God would not let his ſervant <hi>Job</hi> paſs; he cenſured <hi>Job</hi> that <hi>Job</hi> might cenſure himſelf; and points at him, that he might even ſee himſelf pointed at. As if he had ſaid; <hi>What! is this my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>t Job? is it he that I heard ſpeaking at ſuch a rate of impatience and obſcurity? I could not have thought that he would have utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch words about my wayes and works, either towards himſelf or others. Every one of us</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.12.) <hi>ſhall give an account of himſelf to God.</hi> Some have more to account for than themſelves (<hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17.) but all muſt give account for than themſelves; <hi>Give an account of thy ſtewardſhip (Luke</hi> 19.2.) will be ſaid one day to every one. To be a Steward is the ſpecial office of ſome men in reference to men, but 'tis the general of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of all men in reference to God. They cannot ſtand in the day of account, who have not repented of the evil they have done, nor reſted on Chriſt by faith for the doing away of that evil. For the Lord will ſay to one, who is this that hath perverted my Truth? to another, who is this that hath diſobeyed my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands? to a third, who is this that hath diſtruſted my Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes? to a fourth, who is this that hath been ſo unthankful for my Mercies and Favours? He will alſo ſay, who is this that hath op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed his Neighbour? and, who is this that hath been ſelf-proud and wanton? The offender muſt appear, and ſo will his offences. Yea, a citation will come out, as againſt all thoſe who have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:48669:23"/> knowledge refuſed to walk in the light of Gods counſel, ſo to all thoſe (as here to <hi>Job</hi>) who have darkened counſel any way for want of the light of knowledge. And who can ſtand in any of theſe accounts, either for not doing good, or for doing evil, without a Mediatour, upon whoſe account alone we are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted. <hi>Who is this that darkeneth counſel by words without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Taking theſe words as an humbling rebuke upon <hi>Job</hi> for his over-boldneſs, in ſpeaking of God and his wayes;</p>
                  <p>Note;
<q>God will humble all men, his own people eſpecially, and make them know themſelves.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>God will make all men know who they are, who himſelf is, and what they have done or ſpoken. When the Scripture ſaith, who is this? and what is man? When the Scripture asketh what, or who we are? it is either to abaſe the pride of man, or to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince him of his baſe fear of the proudeſt men, as appears ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in theſe two Scriptures. When good men are over-troubled at, or afraid of the power of man, then the Lord chides and ſhames them with this queſtion (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 51.12.) <hi>Who art thou that thou ſhouldeſt be afraid of a man?</hi> As if he had ſaid, what a fool art thou, what an ignorant creature are thou; the Lord ſpake there to his own people, and to them altogether, as is they were but one man) <hi>Who art thou that thou ſhouldeſt be afraid of a man that ſhall dye, and of the ſon of man that ſhall be made as graſs, and forgetteſt the Lord thy Maker?</hi> What a kind of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture art thou, to ſet ſo much by a man (let him be who he will) that thou ſhouldeſt be unduely afraid of him, who by nature is like thy ſelf, frail and mortal, is if thou hadſt nor the immortal God thy Maker for thy helper and defender! They act below men, who over-fear men, while they are in a way of duty to God. <hi>Who art thou, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Scripture uſeth ſuch queſtions when man is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-bold with, or not enough in the fear of God (which is the caſe here in the Text) If any man intrench upon the prerogative of God, he is like to hear of it, with a <hi>Who art thou?</hi> The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle (<hi>Rom.</hi> 9.20.) by way of prevention, repreſents man ſo bold with God, as to darken his counſel, even his eternal counſel,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:48669:24"/> by words without knowledge; <hi>Thou wilt ſay then unto me, why doth he yet find fault? who hath reſiſted his will?</hi> When God, to ſhew his unqueſtionable Sovereignty, ſaith, <hi>Jacob have I loved, and Eſau have I hated: I will have mercy on whom I will have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;</hi> Then man begins to complain of God, and thinks he hath cauſe for it: But ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Who art thou that replieſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God? ſhall the thing formed ſay to him that formed it, why haſt thou made me thus?</hi> When-ever man give occaſion to ſay, that he fears man too much, or God too little; he is like to hear theſe rebuking and humbling queſtions, <hi>Who is this,</hi> or, <hi>Who art thou?</hi> Many have too high thoughts of others, and moſt of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as if they were (as we ſay) <hi>ſome-body,</hi> that is, more than <hi>any-body,</hi> as if they were of ſome greater worth, or had ſome greater worthineſs, than their neighbours. Now, whoſoever have too hign thoughts either of others or of themſelves, they alwayes have too low thoughts of God; and therefore God, to ſhew them their vanity, that all men are but emptineſs, yea very nothing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs compared with him, makes the beſt of men ſtrike ſail, or, God ſhoots down their top-ſail, with ſuch queſtions as theſe, Who are you? and, who is this?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly Note;
<q>We may quickly darken the counſels of God while we think to explain them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Job</hi> had no intent to darken the counſel of God, yet he did it, Some make it their buſineſs (when they ſpeak of the counſels of God) to darken them and raiſe a duſt; theſe are either angry with the light, or envious at it, and unwilling that others ſhould enjoy it. Some Patrons of Popery, the better to make their own excuſe for obſcuring or hiding the Scriptures in darkneſs from the People, have not feared to charge them with darkneſs &amp; obſcurity. And others by their ill and unskilfull handling of the Scriptures have brought darkneſs and obſcurity upon them. Though the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures have many dark places in them, yet woe to thoſe who ſay the Scriptures are dark; and let all take heed of darkening them, for they are the counſel of God. It is an eaſie matter to paddle in a clear ſtream, till it runs muddily; but it will not be for any mans eaſe or peace to do ſo in the clear cryſtal ſtreams of the holy Scriptures. It is the unhappineſs of ſome that they cannot but
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:48669:24"/> ſpeak and write about the counſels of God obſcurely; and there are others who glory that they can. It was ſaid of a dark Pen,<note place="margin">Dum legi v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

It is a great ſin pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely and deſignedly to darken the Counſels of God; and 'tis a failing and an affliction to darken them, though we (as <hi>Job</hi> did not) deſign it not. We ſhould labour to deliver our minds plainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the mind of God, that what we utter may not be ſound a darkning of his Counſel, but as much as in us is, a clearing of it. Counſel (as was toucht before) is the giving of light in dark caſes; and therefore we ſhould enlighten Counſel.</p>
                  <p>Two things are the grace and excellency of a ſpaker:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To ſpeak boldly and freely, to ſpeak the truth out, not to clip nor ſtraiten it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, To ſpeak plainly, to open the truth, and not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate nor involve it. Both theſe are compriſed in one word, by the Apoſtle (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.12.) where he ſaith (as we tranſlate) <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we uſe great plainneſs of ſpeech;</hi> but the Margin hath <hi>great boldneſs of ſpeech:</hi> the ſame word in the Greek ſignifies both plainneſs of ſpeech and boldneſs of ſpeech; and theſe are the two great vertues and ornaments of him that ſpeaketh. Both theſe are again implied in that direction of the Apoſtle (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.11.) <hi>If any man ſpeak</hi> (about the things of God) <hi>let him ſpeak as the Oracles of God;</hi> that is, let him ſpeak as becomes him that hath to do with the Oracles of God, reverently, freely, and boldly; not as if he were ſpeaking the opinions of men, much leſs, <hi>Old Wives fables.</hi> Or let him ſpeak as <hi>the Oracles of God</hi> (ſpeak) that is, plainly, cleerly, not as the Oracles of the Heathens (ſpake) dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, doubtfully. Let us take heed of wrapping up the truth of God, or entangling it, in uncertain expreſſions, which may be interpreted either way, or to quite contrary purpoſes: there is a great danger in this. We may give our ſelves ſome ſcope, or take more liberty, when we are debating about worldly matters, or diſputing the ſubtil queſtions and curioſities of Schoolmen: But when we have to do with the Secrets and Counſels of God, then let us beware and be ſober. Some ſpeak as raſhly and ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently of deepeſt Goſpel Myſteries, as they talk of other mens crotchers, or as of their own trifles.</p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:48669:25"/>
                  <p>Fifthly, Conſider, How did <hi>Job</hi> darken the Counſel of God? It was <hi>by words without knowledge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence Note;
<q>The ignorant are very apt to ſpeak amiſs of the things and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>If <hi>Job,</hi> who had ſo great a meaſure of knowledge, darkened the Counſel of God by words without knowledge; what will they do that have upon the matter no knowledge at all? The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaks of ſuch as more than darkening, even as wreſting the Counſel of God (2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.16.) In <hi>Pauls</hi> Epitles (ſaith he) <hi>are ſome things hard to be underſtood, which they that are unlearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and unſtable wreſt, as they do alſo the other Scriptures, unto their own deſtruction.</hi> Some things in the Word are hard to be known, and they are made harder by ſuch unlearned ones, as utter their own notions of them, by <hi>words without knowledge.</hi> 'Tis very true, that many learned men have wreſted and perverted the Word of God, and ſome of them have employed their learning on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to wreſt and pervert it; but they that have not a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent degree of learning and knowledge, what can they do elſe but wreſt and darken the Word of God? I intend not humane learning meerly, in Arts and Sciences, though there be great uſe of them; but I mean eſpecially Holy and Divine Learning. They that are not taught of God, nor have the light of God in them, cannot but darken the things and Counſels of God, how much humane learning ſoever they have. The Prophet foretels us of Chriſt ſpeaking thus of himſelf, as the great Prophet, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.4.) <hi>The Lord hath given me the tongue the learned, that I ſhould kn w how to ſpeak a word in ſeaſon to him that is weary;</hi> that is, to thoſe who are wearied (not with bodily labours and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels, but) with ſoul-labours and travels, about the pardon of their ſins, and the favour of God to their ſouls. He that ſpeaks a word effectually for the refreſhing of ſuch weary ones, muſt open the Counſels of God to them; and he that doth ſo, muſt have the tongue of the learned, that is, a tongue taught of God how to ſpeak, elſe he will never be able to do it knowingly, but through the darkneſs of his own mind will darken the Counſel of God concerning thoſe dark ſouls, and ſo rather weary them more, than relieve them out of their wearineſs. <hi>That the ſoul be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:48669:25"/> knowledge is not good (Prov.</hi> 19.2.) that is, 'tis very bad, (ſuch Negatives in Scripture intend their contrary Affi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>matives) and as it is not good, or very bad for themſelves, whoſoever they are, ſo it is not good for them with reſpect to others, who are called to declare the Counſels of God to others. Souls without knowledge cannot open, but are apt to darken the Soul-counſels of God.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Inaſmuch as God reproved <hi>Job</hi> for this,</p>
                  <p>Note;
<q>God will not take it well, if we ſpeak improperly, darkly and unſafely of his Matters and Counſels, though our minds be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, and our meaning good in what we ſpeak.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>We had need be cautious what we ſay, and not talk at random about the things of God. <hi>Job,</hi> a holy and a wiſe man, had a peal rung in his ear, for ſpeaking words without knowledge, words not duly poized and placed. There are ſome who will catch at, and take hold of every ſlip of the tongue, they will <hi>make a man an offender for a word,</hi> which hath no real ground of offence in it; (as the Prophet ſpake, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.11.) God may juſtly make a man an offender for a word, which he thought was without offece.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Conſider, when God came to reprove <hi>Job,</hi> he did not charge him with iny ill intentions, but with ill expreſſions. He indeed had darkened his Counſel by words Without knowledge, but God did not ſay he had a purpoſe and a mind to do it; nor did he ſay, that <hi>Job</hi> had ſpoken laſtly, but that he had ſpoken truth obſcurely. The Lord did not object hypocriſie or impiety againſt him, but imbecility; as not having handled the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, nor delivered his own judgement clearly and prudently enough; but had hudled and put things ſo paſſionately and confuſedly together, that ſome could not tell how to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh them from blaſphemy.</p>
                  <p>Hence Note
<q>God will not charge any man beyond his fault.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>If he did it in a heat of paſſion, God will not deal with him, as if he had done it in cold blood (as we ſy) or with a ſetled re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution. The Lord will not call a ſlip of the tongue an errour of the mind, much leſs a minded nor. God knowe the intent and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:48669:26"/> purpoſe of every man that ſpeaks; he weighs not only our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but words; he knows not only what we ſay, but why, and with what aimes we ſay it: and therefore he never urgeth any mans ſin beyond it ſelf. <hi>Job</hi> had darkned the Counſel of God only <hi>by words without knowledge,</hi> therefore God would not charge him to have darkned his Counſel, knowingly, or againſt the light of knowledge. Yea, notwithſtanding this fault, the Lord having reproved him for it, proceeds preſently (as ſome interpret the next verſe) to comfort and encourage him.</p>

Hence the Lord bid <hi>Job</hi> to gird up his loins, who poſſibly was ſo weak, that he could not ſtand upon his legs; or poſſibly had no long garments at all. There is a girding the lions with ſack-cloth, that is, with ſorrow, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the work of repentance and mortification (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 22.12.) <hi>In that day did the Lord God of Hoſts call to weeping, and to mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and to baldneſs, and to girding with ſackcloth.</hi> The two Witneſſes of Chriſt are ſaid <hi>to propheſie in ſackcloth one thouſand two hundred any ſixty dayes (Rev.</hi> 11.3.) to note that they were in a ſad or ſorrowful conditoin all the dayes of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie: Thus <hi>Jobs</hi> loins had been girt a long time.

                  <p>Laſtly, This <hi>girding up of the loins</hi> hath (as ſome conceive) a ſpiritual intendment in it, noting the mortification of luſt, or of the ſenſual appetite. They that go about any buſineſs for God, or with God, had need to have their luſts ſubdued. <hi>Gird up thy loins</hi>

Now then, <hi>Gird up thy loins like a man,</hi> ſhew thy ſtrength, I mean to enter the liſt with thee, I have taken up the glove, as it were, and am reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to try it out with thee. <hi>Gird up thy loins like a man,</hi> Do not play the child, do not triſle with me, do not think that I come to trifle with thee.</p>
                  <p>Some carry the oppoſition thus: <hi>Gird up thy loins like a man,</hi> not like a woman, who girds her ſelf often for ornament only, and ſometimes for oſtentation; but like a man, that reſolves to go about his work, and make a buſineſs of it; Thus, <hi>Gird up thy loins like a man.</hi> To do a thing ſtrenuouſly and with expedition, is the work of a man, who is neither recarded by difficulty, not tired with labour, nor frighted with danger; therefore the Lord counſels <hi>Job</hi> to gird up his loins like as men do, when they ſet themſelves about or undertake any great buſineſs; he would not have him do it, as tender weak women, or as effeminate men.</p>
                  <p>Taking theſe words in the firſt notion, as an encouragement to <hi>Job,</hi> or as comforting words (which I conceive to be a good ſenſe)</p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:48669:27"/>
                  <p>Obſerve;
<q>God is ready to revive poor and afflicted ſouls when they are in any diſtreſs.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He knows how it is with us, and he will not ſuffer any tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation to take hold of us, but ſuch as he will give ſtrength to bear, and encourage us in the bearing of it. He ſaith to fainting ones (as here) Come gird up your loins, or as (<hi>Heb.</hi> 12.12.) <hi>Lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Take the words in that other general notion, God calling <hi>Job</hi> to a great buſineſs, ſaith, Gird up thy loins, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare thy ſelf.</p>
                  <p>VVhence, Note;
<q>We need actual preparation before any duty, eſpecially before great duties.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Never go about any work without your loins girt. A man whoſe mind is ungirt, is unready for any ſervice, though he may have much outward readineſs, and all manner of accomoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for it. VVhen we pray, we ſhould gird up our loins to prayer. The Prophet complained (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.7.) <hi>There's none calls upon thy Name.</hi> VVhat none at all? Surely not ſo; they were not come to that height of Prophaneneſs, as to throw up, or to throw off prayer quite. Many among the Jews, I may ſay all of them prayed, but they did not gird up their loins to prayer: That's fully the Prophets meaning, and alm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſt his language in the next words, <hi>There is none that ſtirreth up himſelf to take hold of thee.</hi> It is not enough to have a habit of grace, unleſs it be ſtirred up to duty, or unleſs we beſtir our ſelves in duty. The Apoſtle exhorts <hi>Timothy</hi> (2 <hi>Ep.</hi> 1.6.) <hi>Stir up the gift of God that is in thee.</hi> If fire be not ſtirred up, it grows dead, and gives little or no heat; 'tis ſo with our gifts and graces.

He that lies upon a ſick-bed, muſt gird up the loins of his mind to beat his affliction; elſe he will never profit by it, nor anſwer the ends of God in it. No grace can be exerciſed by a ſoul ungirded: Therefore remember St. <hi>Peters</hi> counſel (1 <hi>Ep.</hi> 1.13.) <hi>Gird up the loins of your mind, be ſober and hope to the

                  <p>Thirdly, In that he ſaith, <hi>Gird up thy loins like a man:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note;
<q>God would have us do our beſt, our utmoſt, in every thing we do; he would have us put our ſelves out in every duty.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Solomon</hi> adviſeth (<hi>Eccl.</hi> 9.10.) <hi>Whatſoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with all thy might;</hi> that is, <hi>do it like a man,</hi> vigorouſly, ſtrenuouſly, do it with both hands, <hi>Quit you like men</hi> in doing it, <hi>be ſtrong,</hi> as the Apoſtle exhorts (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.3) To do the work of the Lord negligently and ſlightly, with half a heart or no heart, with half a hand or no hand, ſcarce with a little finger, with half ſtrength, or no ſtrength, this is not to do it <hi>like a man.</hi> VVe ſhould be in doing, like the Sun in moving, which, ſaith <hi>David (Pſal.</hi> 19.5.) <hi>As a Bridegroom cometh out of his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and rejoyceth as a ſtrong man to run a race.</hi> If we would run our race like a ſtrong man, ſtrongly and prevailingly, we muſt be ſure to do two things:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, VVe muſt <hi>lay aſide every weight, and the ſin thut doth ſo eaſily beſet us</hi> (Heb. 12.1.)</p>
                  <p>Secondly, VVe muſt (as here the Lord directs <hi>Job</hi>) gird up our loins, and buckle to it.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, As theſe words carry in them a kind of Irony, or divine ſcorn put upon <hi>Iob</hi> by the Holy God; <hi>Come let me ſee what a man thou art;</hi> thou haſt ſpoken often what thou wouldſt do, and what thou wouldſt ſay, if thou couldſt have thy option, thy wiſh; now thou haſt thy wiſh, let me ſee what a man thou art, thou wilt ſurely appear a brave man by the time that I have done with thee.</p>
                  <p>Hence Note,
<q>God will make men ſee how unable they are to deal with him, when 'tis beſt with them, or when they are at the beſt, even when their loins are girt.</q>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:48669:28"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Every man at his beſt eſtate is altogether vanity:</hi> How vain then is man at his worſt! <hi>Job</hi> was low and in a bad condition, as to his outward man eſpecially, when God dealt with him, and how did he carry it, in the day when God dealt with him? <hi>Did his heart endure, or were his hands ſtrong</hi> (as the Prophet ſpake to thoſe, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22.14.) Did he carry it like a man? In one ſenſe not, but like a child, he had not a word to ſpeak; <hi>Once have I ſpoken, but I will ſpeak no more;</hi> yet it muſt be confeſſed, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver carried it ſo like a godly man, as when, like a child, he had a word to ſpeak. God will make man ſee what a nothing he is in his beſt condition, when girt and prepared, when armed <hi>(Cap-a-pe)</hi> all over, for any ſervice for God; even then, man is a vain thing without the preſent aſſiſtance of God; what is he then when he is to contend or plead with God! If the whole world ſhould lay their forces, or, as we ſay, compare notes together, what could they do in diſpute with God? They that think they touch the clouds with their heads, would moulder as duſt at his feet.</p>
                  <p>That ſuch was the contention to which the Lord here calls <hi>Job,</hi> and bids him gird up his loins, or be in a readineſs for, appears plainly in the next words.</p>
                  <q>I will demand of thee, and anſwer thou me.</q>
                  <p>As if the Lord had ſaid, <hi>Thou gaveſt me my choice</hi> (So <hi>Iob</hi> did <hi>chap.</hi> 13.22.) whether I would be Opponent or Defendant; well then ſaith God, this is my choice, I will oppoſe, and do thou anſwer.</p>
                  <q>I will demand of thee.</q>
                  <p>That is, put queſtions to thee; and we ſhall ſee preſently how thick queſtions or demands came upon him like hail-ſhot, and he had not a word to anſwer, though God required it.</p>

To all the demands which the Lord made afterwards, he made no anſwer at all; ſo that theſe words, <hi>Anſwer me,</hi> or <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct and inform me,</hi> are a gentle irony, whereby the Lord would make him know himſelf, or be ſenſible of his own ignorance or ſmall attainments in knowledge; and thereby convince him, that he had done raſhly, in deſiring and wiſhing for ſuch a debate or hearing of his cauſe. The Lord was pleaſed to rebuke him thus ſecretly, or in a figure, and not to fall upon him in plain down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right terms. O thou weak and ignorant creature, who haſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to appear before me, and try thy cauſe with me: Now, Go to, Let me ſee what thou canſt do, ſhew thy beſt skill, put forth thy utmoſt ſtrength of argument, in reaſoning about or againſt my dealings with thee. Thus the Lord might have confounded him; but he was pleaſed to carry it in a milder way, yet in a way as effectual to humble and meeken <hi>Jobs</hi> ſpirit. God needs not preſs man by power, he can do it by reaſon or force of argument, and ſo ſtop his mouth for ever. The Apoſtle ſaith (<hi>Rom.</hi> 3.19.) <hi>All the world ſhall become guilty before God;</hi> and in the ſame Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he ſaith, <hi>God ſhall be juſtified in his ſayings, and overcome when he is judged.</hi> The Lord alwayes doth things with ſo much juſtice, and ſpeaks with ſo much reaſon, that no man is able to anſwer a word, or reply upon him. And though he might ſilence or ſtop any mans mouth, by his meer Command and Authority, yet he condeſcends to do it rather by reaſon and demonſtration, leſt any ſhould ſay, or complain, they were rather over-powered by the greatneſs of his Majeſty, than caſt by the right and equity of his Cauſe. Thus we ſee how the Lord in this Preface prepares <hi>Job</hi> to hearken to thoſe demands that he had to put to him, and to anſwer them if he could; but <hi>Job</hi> (alas poor man!) had not a word to anſwer any one of thoſe demands, which the Lord put to him, either in the following part of this Chapter, or in the next.</p>

                  <p>IN the former Verſe, God told <hi>Job</hi> what himſelf would do, or in what method he would proceed with him; <hi>I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of thee</hi> (ſaith the Lord) or I will put the Queſtion to thee: In this verſe the Lord begins to make his Demands, to put Queſtions to <hi>Job,</hi> and calls for his Anſwer; theſe Demands or Queſtions contain the confutation of <hi>Jobs</hi> former complaining ſpeeches againſt, or, at leaſt, about the dealings of God. The firſt Queſtion we have in this fourth verſe;
<q>Where waſt thou, when I laid the foundations of the Earth?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the clearing of this whole diſcourſe, in which the Lord puts Queſtions or Demands to <hi>Job,</hi> I ſhall firſt conſider the general ſcope of them all, and then the ſpecial matter contained and couched in the preſent context.</p>
                  <p>The ſcope which God ſeems to have in preſſing <hi>Job</hi> with theſe Demands or Queſtions, may be threefold.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That by arguments from the leſs to the greater, he might ſhew <hi>Job,</hi> that he was not able to comprehend the reaſon of his myſterious providential workings towards the children of men, ſeeing he could not give a reaſon of his ſenſible and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral works.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That <hi>Job</hi> being put to confeſs his ignorance about worldly or natural things, he might be brought to have low thoughts of himſelf, and (as he did indeed at laſt in Chapter 42.) <hi>to abhor himſelf, repenting in duſt and aſhes:</hi> Therefore,<note place="margin">Beatus Job poſt interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem verbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris diſcutitur interrogatione ſermonis. <hi>Greg.</hi>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s ſaith upon this place; <hi>After God had a great while, as it were, debated</hi> with him, and queſtioned him by his rod, he now debated with him by word, putting Queſtions to him.</p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:48669:30"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Lord came thick and threefold (as we ſay) up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Job,</hi> with theſe ſearching Queſtions, thereby to convince him, that if by his own mighty power he had made, and by his wiſe providence had ordered the whole courſe of Nature, and all the parts of it, ſo exactly; ſurely then <hi>Job</hi> might collect and conclude that God in his adminiſtrations towards him, a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſingle perſon, muſt needs carry all things in wiſdome and with juſtice. And, that if God did ſhew forth ſo much wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and faithfulneſs, in making, and in ordering the world, which was made for man, and for him among others of mankind; then much more was the providence of God rightly and duly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred unto all men, and him. If the Lord took ſuch care of the Earth, when he had ſhewed his power in making of it; if he took ſuch care about the bruit beaſts and other creatures of the Earth,<note place="margin">Si propter to mundus tanta fruitur provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentia quanto magis ipſe.</note> which are the ſtock of it; then doubtleſſe he took a due care of man, and of him in particular, man being the chief part of this lower creation, and <hi>Job</hi> being a principal one among the ſons of men.</p>
                  <p>More diſtinctly. In this Context, and thoſe which follow, about the works of God, the conviction ariſeth three wayes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Job,</hi> or God deals with him by a threefold argument; and all to humble him, and bring him upon his knees.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, By comparing the eternity of God with <hi>Jobs</hi> time, who was but of yeſterday; therefore ſaith he, <hi>Where waſt thou when I laid the foundations of the Earth?</hi> As if he had ſaid, pray how old are you, that you ſhould take upon you to contend with me, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout my dealings with you? As the Jews ſaid ignorantly to Chriſt, whoſe day <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaw by faith, and was glad, <hi>Thou art not yet fifty years old, and haſt thou ſeen Abraham?</hi> (John 8.57.) So the Lord might ſay in the fulneſs of his knowledge, to <hi>Job,</hi> Thou art not yet a hundred years old, ſure; <hi>Where</hi> (then) <hi>waſt thou when I laid the foundations of the Earth?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Lord ſets before <hi>Job</hi> his own Omniſcience, and thereby convinceth <hi>Job</hi> of his ignorance, or of the little know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as well as experience, that he had of things done long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: <hi>Declare</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>if thou haſt underſtanding,</hi> at the fourth verſe; and <hi>if thou knoweſt,</hi> at the fifth verſe. As if the Lord had ſaid, I can declare theſe things, I know theſe things; what's thy knowledge about them, in compariſon of my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge?
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:48669:30"/> thy light is but darkneſs, and thy knowledge ignorance, compared with mine; therefore preſume not.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Lord convinceth <hi>Job</hi> by his helpleſneſs to him, both in the Works of Creation and Providence; thereby ſetting forth his own Omnipotency, together with <hi>Jobs</hi> impotency; which was ſuch as contributed nothing either to the Creation, or to the Government of the World. <hi>Where waſt thou, when I laid the foundations of the Earth,</hi> and did all theſe things? Didſt thou come to give me either counſel how to do them, or lend me thy hand in the doing of them? Surely no; I did them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, thou waſt not in being, thou art not from the beginning. Thy knowledge is very ſmall, and thy power and ſtrength ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, as to the bringing about of any of theſe things; therefore ſee thy vanity, in ſpeaking thus complainingly, about my deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with thee.</p>
                  <p>From and upon all theſe conſiderations, the Lord would have <hi>Job</hi> ſit down and acknowledge, that it muſt needs be extream raſhneſs in him to find fault with any of his Diſpenſations, or plead with him about them: The general argument may be fram'd thus;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He is blame-worthy, that finds fault with or complains about any thing in the Government of God, or will adventure to diſpute, and debate with him about it; unleſs he have ſomewhat like the Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the Wiſdom, the Might, and Power of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But</hi> Job <hi>thou haſt nothing like the Eternity of God, for thou art but of the other day; thou haſt nothing like the Omniſcience of God, for thou art ignorant of what God hath done, and deſtitute of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel what to do thy ſelf: Thou haſt nothing like the Power of God, the Arm of God, thou art weak, thou canſt not make the leaſt worm, the leaſt fly; ſurely, then thou canſt do nothing towards the making of a world: Therefore thou art blame worthy, for finding fault with, and complaining about what God hath done.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt Propoſition is fully implied, throughout the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. The Aſſumption is expreſt in many ſharp and cutting queries, from the 4th <hi>ver.</hi> of this Chapter, <hi>Where waſt thou, &amp;c.</hi> to the 34th of the next.

Every man had a being in the mind of God, when God laid the foundations of the Earth; but where waſt thou or any man, as to any exiſtence, when I laid the foundations of the Earth?

                  <p>And here we may take notice of the difference of Scripture lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage in this point, with reſpect to our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; &amp; by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the different language of the Scripture concerning Chriſt, we have a clear argument to prove the God-head of Chriſt, or that he is God by Nature; foraſmuch as he had his exiſtence, when God laid the foundation of the Earth.

                  </p>
                  <p>You ſee how the Spirit ſpeaks concerning Chriſt, the true Wiſdom, the ſubſtantial Wiſdom, he was before God laid the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:48669:32"/> foundations of the Earth; therefore he is God, he is eternal. But when God comes to ſpeak to <hi>Job,</hi> a man, he ſaith, <hi>Where waſt thou when I laid the foundations of the Earth?</hi> (John 1.1.) <hi>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was God; and by him all things were made.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt had a hand in making the World, in laying the foundations of it, the work is aſcribed to him.

                     <hi>Where waſt thou, when I laid the foundations of the Earth?</hi> 'Tis as if the Lord had ſaid, Remember how ſhort a time thou haſt been, how little a while it is ſince thou cam'ſt into the World?</p>

                  <p>Firſt, A foundation is the loweſt part of a building. The <hi>Top</hi> or <hi>Head-ſtone</hi> (Zach. 4.7.) and the foundation-ſtone, are at utmoſt diſtance; the one higheſt, the other loweſt, the one firſt laid down, the other laſt ſet up.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The foundation is an unſeen part of the building: we behold the ſuper-ſtructure, the walls and towers, when raiſed, we behold the battlements and pinnacles; but we cannot behold the foundation, that's an unſeen part of the building.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The foundation is the moſt neceſſary part of the building. There are ſome parts of a building, which are onely for ornament and beauty; there are other parts of a building, which though they are ſomewhat neceſſary, yet not much neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; the building might ſtand without them, but a foundation is of abſolute neceſſity: there cannot be: continuing houſe without a foundation.</p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:48669:32"/>
                  <p>Fourthly, The foundation is the ſupport of the whole build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; that bears and upholds all the reſt.</p>
                  <p>But ſome may ſay, What are the foundations of the Earth?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, A foundation may be taken either properly, or metaphorically; formally, or alluſively.</p>
                  <p>The foundations of the Earth are not formal, but metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal foundations: 'Tis a ſpeech borrowed from men, who muſt have a proper foundation for their buildings. The Earth is not laid upon any formal, but it hath a vertual foundation. The Scripture ſaith ſometimes, that the Earth is founded upon the <hi>ſeas, and eſtabliſhed upon the floods</hi> (Pſal. 24.2.) yet in a proper ſenſe, the Sea is not the foundation of the Earth. It's ſaid alſo, (<hi>Job</hi> 26.7.) <hi>He hangeth the Earth upon nothing.</hi> The whole bulk of Sea and Earth together, are one Globe, one Building, formed and compacted together.</p>
                  <p>But the Earth may be ſaid to have foundations, and that God hath laid the foundations of it; for this reaſon: Becauſe the Earth is ſet faſt and firm, it is like a houſe that hath foundations, not only a foundation, but foundations; it ſtands moſt firm. A houſe builded upon a rock (<hi>Matth.</hi> 7.25.) ſtands faſt and immoveably in all weathers, becauſe built upon a ſure foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: A houſe builded upon the ſands, falls, it hath no ſure foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation. The Earth is made firm, ſtrong, and ſure, as thoſe houſes or buildings that are raiſed upon rocks; and is therefore ſaid to have foundations. Why is Heaven, or the ſtate of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, called <hi>a City having foundations</hi> (Heb. 11.10.) but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſtate of glory, or that glorious City, is a firm ſtate; or (as it is called in another place (<hi>Chap.</hi> 13.14.) <hi>a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing City:</hi> A City which ſhall it ſelf continue for ever, and whoſe Citizens (without ſucceſſion) continue for ever. Now though the Earth be but a moveable tent or weak cottage, in compariſon of Heaven or our heavenly ſtate; yet God in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Wiſdom and Power, hath formed and eſtabliſhed it ſo firmly for the habitation of man and all inferiour creatures, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on its own center; that the Lord may truly be ſaid to have built it upon foundations, or to have appointed foundations for it: as 'tis often expreſſed elſewhere (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.25. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.5. <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.29.) as well as here. <hi>Where waſt thou,</hi>

                        <pb n="48" facs="tcp:48669:33"/>When I laid the foundations of the Earth?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The form of the words is conſiderable, in oppoſition to that opinion of ſome of the Ancients,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Aquin.</hi> in loc.</note> who attributed the ſite of the Earth, and of the other Elements, not to any divine ſupernatural Power of the Maker, but to the very Nature of the Earth, or the neceſſity of the Matter; according to which, heavy things tend downward, and light things riſe high; ſo according to that opinion, the Earth being a heavy body, falleth loweſt, or took its place of its ſelf. Now that this opinion may be conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ſhut out of doors, the Lord compares his making of the World, to the building of a houſe; which is ordered according to the reaſon of the builder: ſo that though it be a truth in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that heavy things fall loweſt, yet we are to aſcribe all to the Wiſdom of God, the Diſpoſer of them; who hath done all things according to the pleaſure of his own Will, and that with ſuch admirable contrivance, that man is not able to comprehend it; as the laſt words of the verſe intimate: Where waſt thou, when I laid the foundation of the Earth? <hi>Declare if thou haſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But before I paſs to thoſe words in the latter part of the verſe, I ſhall gather up ſome obſervations from this former part of it; <hi>Where waſt thou, when I laid the foundations of the Earth? &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence Note, Firſt;
<q>The time of man upon Earth, compared with the Eternity of God, is nothing.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Where waſt thou? David</hi> (Pſal. 39.4.) prayed that God would teach him how frail he was, as to the duration of his life; and he adds in the next verſe, <hi>Mine age is nothing before thee.</hi> The age of man is nothing before God, if we conſider it as to its beginning, or if we conſider it as to its ending. When began the age of the moſt aged man? Are not all men of <hi>yeſterday?</hi> God had an eternity of Being, before man was upon the face of the earth. And what's the age of man as to its continuance? As it began but yeſterday, that is, a very little while ago, or but the day paſt; ſo it may end to morrow, that is within a few dayes to come, yea poſſibly before the next day or the morrow cometh. Boaſt not of to morrow (<hi>Prov.</hi> 27.1.) both becauſe
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:48669:33"/> thou knoweſt not what a day may bring forth, nor whether, as to thee, a to morrow ſhall be brought forth. Death ſweeps men ſuddenly from the face of the earth; only the Lord alwayes is, and is alwayes the ſame: All things change, but God is not changed: He is himſelf, and his years fails not: Then what's mans age compared to God?</p>
                  <p>Note, Secondly;
<q>God is the firſt Being.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Where waſt thou, when I laid the foundations of the Earth? God alone was before all things;</hi> yet he was not at all alone:<note place="margin">Anteomnia erat deus ſolus, ipſe ſibi &amp; mundus &amp; locus &amp; tempus &amp; omnia. <hi>Tertul.</hi> adverſus <hi>Prax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eam.</hi> cap. <hi>5.</hi>
                     </note> For (as one of the Ancients ſaith) He <hi>was to</hi> himſelf a world, place, and time, and all things.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly;
<q>God is an Eternal Being.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It's poſſible for one to be firſt, and not to be eternal. One man may have a Being before another, and not have a Being from eternity; but God had an eternal Being, before the world had a Being, or man any Being in the world.</p>
                  <p>There are Things of three ſorts:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Such as have had a beginning, and ſhall have an end, and be no more. Thus it is with all meer ſenſitive Creatures, the Beaſts of the Earth, and Fowls of the Ayre; they periſh, there's an end of their being, when they die, or come to the end of their lives.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There are other things which have had a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, yet ſhall have no end; As Spirits, Angels good or bad, and the ſouls of men: yea, the bodies of men, though they are ſubject to, and are cut off by death, yet they ſhall return a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; and having been ſown in corruption, ſhall be raiſed in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruption; and be clothed with immortality, which is a piece of Eternity.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, There is a Being, which is without beginning, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ending; and that is Gods Being only, or the Being of God; who thus expreſt himſelf to <hi>Moſes, I am, and I am that I am;</hi> (Exod. 3.14.) That word takes in all Time, paſt, preſent, and to come; yea, paſt, preſent, and to come, are all one in Gods Being (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.1.) <hi>Thou haſt been our habitation, from generation to generation:</hi> That is,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:48669:34"/> We thy people, have alwayes, or in all revolutions of time, dwelt or ſheltered our ſelves in thee: and then at the ſecond verſe, they confeſs not only their being in him throughout all generations, but his moſt bleſſed Being before all generations; <hi>Before Mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadſt formed the Earth, and the World; even from everlaſting to everlaſting, thou art God.</hi> The firſt Being is an eternal Being, and therefore the Prophet ſaith (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.15.) <hi>God inhabiteth Eternity.</hi> The Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal dwells in Eternity. But what is Eternity? One of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents calleth it,<note place="margin">Aeternitas eſt interminabilis vitae tota ſimul et perfect poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſio. <hi>Boeth.</hi> de Conſol. <hi>l. 6.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>The perfect poſſeſſion of a boundleſs or limitleſs life, whole, and all at once.</hi> Eternity hath no terms, nor bounds of beginning or ending: 'Tis a poſſeſſion of all at once, there is nothing paſt, or to come; but all is alwayes preſent to God.</p>
                  <p>Note, Fourthly;
<q>God is the fountain of all being, he hath given a being to all things.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> (Acts 17.28.) diſcourſing with the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> having ſaid, <hi>In him we live, and move, and have our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> convinceth them further by that ſaying of their own Poets, <hi>for we are alſo his off-ſpring;</hi> We ſpring from him as from a root or fountain. <hi>With him is the fountain of lives</hi> (Pſal. 36.9.) even of natural life, as well as of ſpiritual and eternal: Every life, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry being, is but a ſtream iſſuing from <hi>Jehovah.</hi> And as every life is from God, ſo alſo is the being of all things without life. The Lord gave the liveleſs Earth its being, its beginning. Some Naturaliſts have aſſerted the eternity of the World, and ſo the eternity of the Earth: They could not compaſs which way or how the World could have a beginning, and therefore ſaid it had none. Here we have the Founder of the World, God himſelf, teaching man this Divine Philoſophy about the beginning of the World, and taking it to himſelf, <hi>I laid the foundations of the Earth.</hi> When the <hi>Heathen Philoſopher</hi> read what <hi>Moſes</hi> had written concerning the Creation of the World; <hi>Thus the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and the Earth were finiſhed, and all the hoſt of them</hi> (Ger. 2.1.) He preſently ſaid, <hi>The man ſpeaks wonders, but how doth he prove what he hath ſpoken?</hi> Where are his demonſtrations? He would put <hi>Moſes</hi> to his proof: but <hi>Moſes's</hi> proof was faith in the teſtimony of God. <hi>Through faith we underſtand that the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:48669:34"/> Worlds were framed by the Word of God; ſo that things which are ſeen, were not made of things which do appear</hi> (Heb. 11.3.) We underſtand the Work of Creation, yet not by the ſtrength of natural reaſon, but through faith; which gives credit to the Word of God, and perſwades the heart that the report therein made is a truth.<note place="margin">Plato in Timaeo.</note> For though ſome Philoſophers have evinced by arguments grounded upon reaſon, that the World was made; yet that it was made by the Word of God, either the Eſſential Word, <hi>the Son of God</hi> ſpoken of (<hi>John</hi> 1.1.) who is the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cauſe of it; or by the Declarative Word, ſpoken of in this place of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> which was the means or inſtrumental cauſe of making the World (<hi>Gen.</hi> 1.3, 6.) This, I ſay, cannot at all be underſtood by reaſon, but purely and only by faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is ſo revealed in the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, In that the Lord here ſaith, <hi>I laid the foundations of the Earth:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Obſerve;
<q>God hath made the Earth firm and immoveable.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſtability of the Earth is of God, as much as the being and exiſtence of it (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.5.) <hi>He laid the foundations of the Earth, that it ſhould not be removed for ever.</hi> There have been many Earthquakes or movings of the Earth in ſeveral parts of it, but the whole body of the Earth was never removed, ſo much as one hairs breadth out of its place, ſince the foundations thereof were laid. <hi>Archimedes</hi> the great Mathematician, ſaid, <hi>If you will give me a place to ſet my Engine on, I will remove the Earth.</hi> It was a great b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ag; but the Lord hath laid it faſt enough for mans removing. Himſelf can make it quake and ſhake, he can move it when he pleaſeth; but he never hath nor will remove it. He hath laid the foundations of the Earth that it ſhall not be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, nor can it be at all moved, but at his pleaſure; and when it moves at any time, it is to mind the ſons of men that they by their ſins have moved him to diſpleaſure. There hath been or will be a ſhaking of the Earth in mercy, for we have it in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe (<hi>Heb.</hi> 12.26.) <hi>Whoſe voice then</hi> (namely at the giving of the Law) <hi>ſhook the Earth; but now he hath promiſed, ſaying, yet once more I ſhake not the Earth only, but alſo Heaven.</hi> Some under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this promiſe as fulfilled at the coming of Chriſt in the fleſh,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:48669:35"/> at which time indeed there were notable and amazing moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and alterations both in Heaven and Earth. Others expound it of the Day of the ultimate Judgement; not a few of ſome great providential diſpenſations of God, which ſhall ſhake not the Earth only, but alſo the Heavens, as taken in a Metaphor for earthly and heavenly things, referring to the Church of God and the Kingdomes of Men. I ſhall not interpoſe in this matter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ſenſe of that Text: but onely ſay, whatever the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle meant by Earth or Heaven, and the ſhaking of it, yet this remains as an unſhaken Axiom, that the Fabrick of the Earth (properly taken) ſtands faſt: <hi>The Lord hath laid the foundations of it, that it ſhould not be removed. David</hi> to ſhew the ſtedfaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his faith, put that ſuppoſition (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 46.2.) <hi>Therefore will not we fear, though the Earth be moved.</hi> The Prophet alſo did the like, to aſſure us of the ſtability of the Covenant of Grace (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.10.) yet we need not fear that either the Earth ſhall be removed, or the Mountains depart. Such ſuppoſitions ſhew indeed the immoveableneſs of the Word which God hath ſpoken, not the moveableneſs (by any natural power or natural decay) of the Earth, whoſe foundations he hath laid. And hence the Pſalmiſt argues the Lords faithfulneſs to his Word (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.90.<note place="margin">Non magis mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veronaturaliter terra, quam qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſcere coelum poteſt. <hi>Bold.</hi>
                     </note>) All earthly things move, but the Earth wherein all theſe motions are made, <hi>ſtands ſtill (Eccl.</hi> 1.4.) The Earth can no more move, than the Heavens can ſtand ſtill. Some mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Philoſophers have turned the ſcale of Nature, and would perſwade us that <hi>the Heavens ſtand ſtill, and the Earth moves:</hi> but 'tis good for us to ſtand to and abide by the Scripture, which tells us, the Earth <hi>ſtands ſtill and abideth;</hi> or it abideth, that is, <hi>it ſtandeth,</hi> as the Margin explains it (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.90.) And that it ſtandeth ſtill or abideth, not only becauſe it hath ſtill a being (as things in motion have) but becauſe it is ſtill, or ſtands without moving, is ſo much my faith, as well as my ſenſe, that I ſee no reaſon to be moved from it.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>The Power and Will of God are the onely foundation of the Earth.</hi> 'Tis ſaid by the Pſalmiſt, he hath founded it upon the waters (as was ſhewed before) yet that cannot be meant proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for how can water, a fluid body, naturally bear up or ſuſtain the Earth, a heavy body, and not at all boyant? We all ſee it hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth or ſtandeth in the ayre. But what foundation can the ayre be
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:48669:35"/> to the Earth, which will ſcarcely bear a feather. It remains then undeniable that the Will and Power of God are the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the Earth:<note place="margin">Rationi nihil occurrit, cui in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitatur terra, ſi divinam exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peris volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem. <hi>Nazian. Orat. 24.</hi>
                     </note> There's nothing can be given or aſſigned in reaſon, if you look not to the Will of God, for the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Earth. Beſides that, there's no bottom for it. One of the Ancients giving a deſcription of the Creation, ſaith, <hi>All things are laid up in his Power and Will; theſe are the foundations, the ſtay, and eſtabliſhment of all things.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Omnia repoſita exiſtimo in ejus poteſtate, quod voluntas ejus ſit fundamentum univerſorum. <hi>Ambr.</hi> l. <hi>1. Hexam. c. 6.</hi>
                     </note> And as it is ſo with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the ſtanding of the Earth, ſo, with reſpect to all thoſe great things which God hath promiſed to do in the Earth; the foundation of them all, is his own Power and Will, or his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Will. The foundation laid in Election, and the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on laid in Redemption by Jeſus Chriſt (other foundation can no man lay for all our ſpiritual comforts, preſent priviledges, and future hopes (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.11.) Theſe foundations, I ſay) were laid in the Will of God, <hi>Lo I come to do thy Will, O God,</hi> (Heb. 10.7.9.) The Will of God is the foundation and eſtabliſhment of all things, whether Natural or Civil, Spiritual or Eternal.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, From the ſcope of theſe words we may</p>
                  <p>Obſerve;
<q>God who hath made the Earth by his Power, doth alſo govern it, and man who inhabits it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore man ought to be quiet, and ſit down in his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning as well as in his Creating Will. To convince and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade <hi>Job</hi> of this, is (as hath been toucht) the purpoſe of God in all that followeth. He that hath made the World, governs the World; and if ſo, ſhall poor creatures, you or I, or any other, though a <hi>Job,</hi> find fault with his government of it? Will a Maſter-Builder ſuffer any one to find fault with his work, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands not how to lay a ſtone in it, much leſs to give the rule or direction for the whole work? Foraſmuch then as the Lord is not only the Maſter-Builder, but the ſole Maker of this great Houſe, the World, it becomes man, for whoſe uſe it was made, to acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſce or reſt quietly in his Government of it. Surely, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of all things, hath a right to diſpoſe of all things; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all perſons are to be ſatisfied in his diſpoſal of them.</p>
                  <p>From the whole verſe and the obſervations given upon it, take theſe Scripture inferences.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The Scripture makes this inference from it; <hi>God is one,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:48669:36"/> and there is none like to him</hi> (Iſa. 40.26. Iſa. 46.8.) <hi>To whom will ye liken me? to whom will you compare me? I am he that ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out the heavens, and laid the foundation of the earth.</hi> there's none like to him in Wiſdome, none in Power, who laid the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Earth. There was never ſuch a viſible piece of work done in the World, as the making of the World; therefore the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e is none ſuch as the Maker of the World. The hypocrite is brought in dreaming that <hi>God was altogether ſuch as himſelf</hi> (Pſal. 50.21.) And 'tis, as it hath been, the common guiſe of Idolaters, to think that God is no better than their Idol. But what the Lord by his Prophet (<hi>Jer.</hi> 10.11, 12) taught the captive Jews to ſay to their great Lords the Babylonians, the ſame hath he taught us to ſay to all Hypocrites and Idolaters: <hi>The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, ſhall periſh from the earth, and from under theſe heavens:</hi> Then preſently followeth (as in <hi>Job) He hath made the earth by his power, he hath eſtabliſhed the world by his wiſdom, and hath ſtretched out the heavens by his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion.</hi> As if it had been ſaid, Will ye imagine that the Idols which you have made, are like him, who made you and all things? And 'tis conſiderable, that whereas the whole Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie of <hi>Jeremy</hi> is written in the Hebrew Tongue, this eleventh verſe, which holds out at once a teſtimony and a threatning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe Idolaters, is written in the Chaldean Language, with which the Jews by their long Captivity in <hi>Babylon</hi> were well acquainted; that ſo the Babylonians might hear of it, and know that the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who made heaven and earth, was alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unlike their gods, who did never ſo much as arrogate to themſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lves any hand in, much leſs, the ſole power of making heaven and earth.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Take this Scripture inference. Seeing the Lord hath laid the foundations of the earth, by his own Power and Wiſdome, then, <hi>He is the Proprietor of the whole earth, or the whole earth is the Lords proper poſſeſſion</hi> (Pſal. 34.1.) <hi>The earth is the Lords, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d the fulneſs thereof;</hi> the Lord made it, and it is his. He was not called, nor ſet a work to build this great Houſe for another; but he made i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, as by his own power, ſo for his own pleaſure; all the inhabitants of the earth are his tenants: and not only the earth, but the whole ſtock and furniture of it is his: For as the Lord made the earth, ſo all that the earth is ſtored
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:48669:36"/> with. Thus ſpake <hi>Abraham</hi> (Gen. 14.22.) to the King of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> who <hi>bid him take the goods to himſelf: I have lifted up my hand unto the Lord, the moſt high God, poſſeſſor of heaven and earth:</hi> that <hi>I will not take from a threed even to a ſhoe latchet, &amp;c.</hi> As if he had ſaid, <hi>The Lord who is poſſeſſor of heaven and earth, is my portion, my poſſeſſion; and he can give me enough of the earth, yea he will give me heaven alſo:</hi> therefore, <hi>I will not take any thing of thine, leſt thou ſhouldest ſay, I have made Abraham rich.</hi> The Lord, who is poſſeſſor of the earth, can give his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple what earthly portions, or poſſeſſions of the earth he pleaſeth. And let us remember, what earthly portions ſoever we have in this world, we have no reaſon to boaſt; ſeeing all is the Lords, and we are but his ſtewards and tenants at will. And becauſe 'tis the Lords earth which we poſſeſs, let us alſo remember to pay our rent, our quit-rent to him, that is, thanks duly and dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; leſt we provoke him to diſtrain upon us, or to take the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture, and turn us out of all. Many hold lands from great Lords, to pay only ſome ſmall rent or ſervice, in a way of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement; O let us remember to pay our rent to our Great Land-Lord, The Lord of the whole earth. They who acknowledge, what they have is his, or that they have and hold all they have of him; will honour him with what they have, <hi>even with their ſubſtance, and with the firſt fruits of all their increaſe,</hi> (Prov. 3.9.)</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, We may infer; Seing <hi>God founded the earth, He is alſo the Ruler of it.</hi> And that the Lord rules the earth, is a mercy to all men on the earth. <hi>The Lord reigns, let the earth rejoyce</hi> (Pſal, 97.1.) That is, men of the earth have cauſe to rejoyce, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have God, who is infinitely both wiſe and good, to rule them. <hi>The Lord is King over all the earth; ſing ye praiſes with underſtanding</hi> (Pſal. 47.7.) And ſurely they who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what a King he is, will praiſe him.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, We may be encouraged <hi>to go unto God, or apply our ſelves to God, about all things here on earth, ſeeing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                        </gap>dations of the earth.</hi> The Lord having invited his people to <hi>ask him things to come concerning his ſons, and concerning the work of his hands, to command him</hi> (Iſa. 45.11.) adds this in the next words, as an encouragement to do ſo; <hi>I have made the earth, and created man upon it:</hi> As if he had ſaid, <hi>Ask of me
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:48669:37"/> whatever you would have me do, or would have done on earth; for I am he that created the earth.</hi> It may help our faith much, when (as <hi>David</hi> expreſſeth it, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 11.3.) the very <hi>foundations</hi> (of earthly things) are deſtroyed, to conſider that God laid the foundations of the earth: In ſuch a caſe it may be ſaid (as it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth there in the Pſalme) <hi>What can the righteous do?</hi> but may it not be ſaid even in that hard caſe, when foundations are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, <hi>What cannot the Lord do, who laid the foundations of the earth?</hi> This argument the Pſalmiſt alſo uſeth (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 124.8.) <hi>Our help ſtands in the Name of the Lord, who made heaven and earth.</hi> Though earth and heaven ſhake, and ſeem to be confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded or mingled together, yet he who made heaven and earth without help, can give us help, or be our helper. If our help ſtood in the beſt of men made of earth, they might fail us; but while our help ſtands in him that made the earth, he will never fail us, for he hath ſaid he will not (<hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5.) and their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience who have truſted the Lord, hath ſaid it too (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.10.) This is the great priviledge of all that believe, they may addreſs to God by Chriſt for any thing in this earth, becauſe he is the Maker of it; and having made it by a word ſpeaking, what can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not he do for them, if he ſpeak the word?</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Let us be much in <hi>praiſing the Lord for his wiſdom, power, and greatneſs, all which gloriouſly appear and ſhine forth in his laying the foundations of the earth. David</hi> makes this a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al part of Divine praiſe (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 136.6.) VVe ſhould not onely praiſe the Lord for the great things he hath done on the earth, but for this, that he hath made the earth. The work of God in lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the foundations of the earth, calls as loudly for our praiſe, as any thing (except our redemption from the earth (<hi>Rev.</hi> 5.9. <hi>chap.</hi> 14.3.) which ever God wrought upon the face of the earth. The making of the earth calls us to praiſe the Lord:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe he hath made ſo vaſt a body as this earth is, or becauſe he hath made ſuch a large houſe for us.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Becauſe he hath founded it ſo miraculoſly, hanging upon nothing that appears, but in the ayre; yet ſtanding more firmly than any houſe built upon a rock.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, VVe ſhould praiſe the wiſdom of God, that hath formed it ſo exactly, and adorned it ſo richly: It's not a houſe huddled and clapt up together, without skill or art, though it
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:48669:37"/> was made word a word ſpeaking in ſix days, yet it was made with infinite wiſdom, as is more particularly held out (<hi>v.</hi> 5.) where the Lord ſpeaks of laying <hi>the meaſures thereof, and ſtretching the line upon it;</hi> as alſo of <hi>faſtning the foundations and laying the c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner-ſtone thereof;</hi> all which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ew it is not a houſe clapt up in haſte, but made with admirable exactneſs: ſo that (as 'tis uſual when great houſes are built) there were great acclamations made at the building of it; as we have it the ſeventh verſe of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then <hi>the morning ſtars ſang together, and all the ſons of God ſhouted for joy,</hi> to ſee ſuch a magnificent pile reared up.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Take this inference; <hi>If the viſible world be ſuch a building, what is the inviſible world,</hi> the City <hi>having foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> which God hath prepared for thoſe that love him?</p>
                  <p>Thus much of the firſt part of <hi>Jobs</hi> Conviction, he had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do in laying the foundations of the earth, and he had as little in ſetting up and finiſhing that goodly ſtructure, as will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in that which followeth.</p>
                  <p>Yet before the Lord proceeded any further to queſtion <hi>Job</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this great work of Creation, he requires or calls for his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer in the cloſe of this fourth verſe, to the queſtion propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the former part of it; <hi>Where waſt thou, when I laid the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the Earth?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>Declare, if thou haſt underſtanding.</q>
                  <p>God challengeth <hi>Job</hi> to anſwer: The Hebrew is, <hi>If thou knoweſt underſtanding.</hi> And ſo the word is uſed (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.24.) where we render, <hi>They alſo that erred in ſpirit ſhall come to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,</hi> or (as the Margin hath it) <hi>ſhall know underſtanding.</hi> Again, <hi>Huram</hi> ſaid (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 2.12.) <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord God of Iſrael, that made heaven and earth; who hath given to David the King a wiſe ſon, endued with prudence and underſtanding;</hi> The Original is thus ſtrictly read, <hi>Knowing prudence and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

                  <p>Declare, if thou haſt underſtanding, how the foundations
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:48669:38"/> of the earth were laid. Man knoweth not where he was, not what he was, before he was: how then ſhould he declare how any thing was done by God before he was? The great thing which God would inform <hi>Job</hi> in, is the ſame which the Apoſtle would inform us all in (<hi>Rom.</hi> 11.33, 34.) while he brake out as a man amazed at the ſight of a tremendous gulf in this paſſionate Exclamation, <hi>O the depth of the riches both of the wiſdom and knowledge of God! how unſearchable are his judgements and his wayes paſt finding out! for who hath known the mind of the Lord, or who hath been his Counſellor?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Lord having put this queſtion to <hi>Job</hi> about the Creation of the Earth in general, proceedeth more diſtinctly, to put him queſtions about that work in alluſion to buildings.</p>
                  <p>And here are four things in theſe two verſes which have a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold reſpect to buildings: Here are two things which have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the form and ſymetry of a building: And here are two things which have reſpect to the ſtrength and firmneſs of a building.</p>
                  <p>The form, ſymetry, and right order of a building, is laid down in the fifth verſe, where the Lord ſpeaks of the meaſures of the earth, and of ſtretching out a line upon it. The meaſuring of a building, and the ſtretching out of the line upon it, reſpect the right ordering and modelling, or the due frame of the fabrick.</p>
                  <p>The two other things that concern the ſtrength of a building, are the laying of the foundation and the faſtening of the corner-ſtone; both theſe we have in the ſixth verſe: <hi>Whereupon are the foundations thereof faſtened? or who laid the corner-ſtone thereof?</hi> So then, we have here theſe two great and neceſſary concernments of a building:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The due form.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The firmneſs of it.</p>
                  <p>When a builder intends to raiſe a fabrick, he firſt conſidereth and meaſureth the ground or plat where he intends to build: With reſpect to this, ſaith God, <hi>Who hath laid the meaſures thereof?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, When he is building,<note place="margin">Ad amuſſi e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riguntur parie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.</note> he uſeth his line to keep the work level and right: with reſpect to which God ſaith, <hi>Who hath ſtretched the line upon it?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:48669:39"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, The builder, that his work may be ſubſtantial, will be ſure to fix his foundation ſure: in reſpect of which, the Lord enquires of <hi>Job; Whereupon are the foundations thereof faſtened?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The builder will be very careful to ſet right the corner-ſtone which holds the walls together: with reſpect to which he demands an account in theſe words, <hi>Who hath laid the corner ſtone thereof?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <bibl>
                        <hi>Verſ. 5.</hi>
                     </bibl> Who hath laid the meaſures thereof?</q>
                  <p>That is, taken the meaſures of the earth: Theſe meaſures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the quantity or dimenſions of the earth, its length, breadth, and thickneſs; theſe were laid meerly according to the good pleaſure of God, which no man is able to give a reaſon of; and therefore, he adds, <hi>if thou knoweſt.</hi> The word which we ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>laid,</hi> implies a laying with art, as alſo with care and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence; in all keeping a due decorum or proportion, reſpecting the length, breadth, and deepneſs of the building. God uſed this word when he ſpake to <hi>Moſes</hi> about the fabrick of mans body (which is a little world, a compendium of the greater world) (<hi>Exod.</hi> 4.11.) <hi>Who hath made mans mouth? or who hath</hi> made <hi>the deaf or the ſeeing? &amp;c.</hi> The Text is, <hi>Who hath laid mans mouth?</hi> Who hath laid it in that due proportion, or ſo placed it, that it may fit with the whole, and every member, that it with the eyes, eares, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may ſtand in perfect order, both for uſe and ornament? Thus the Lord hath laid the meaſures of the earth; He meaſured out the ſeveral parts of it, where the vallies ſhould be, and where the plains; where the hills and mountains, and where the rivers and channels: He meaſured all theſe, that is, he diſpoſed them in a comely order. There is a great appearance of the wiſdom of God in ſetling every thing in its proper place, that one may anſwer in proportion with another; the perfection and beauty of the whole ariſeth out of the ſymetry and proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onableneſs of the parts. <hi>Who hath laid the meaſures thereof?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Further, This laying the meaſures, notes, as the exactneſs, ſo the greatneſs of the work. In Scripture language, <hi>a building of meaſures, or an houſe of meaſures,</hi> ſignifieth a great houſe or building (<hi>Jer.</hi> 22.14.) <hi>Wo to him, that ſaith, I will build me a wide houſe and large chambers:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Doman com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſuratam. <hi>Sept.</hi>
                     </note> The Hebrew is, <hi>an houſe of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,</hi> that is, of a great meaſure. The Septuagint render it, <hi>a
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:48669:39"/> meaſured houſe,</hi> a houſe having a due proportion of longitude and latitude, of heighth and depth. When the ſearchers ſent by <hi>Moſes</hi> came back and reported the ſtate of the land which they had viewed, we ſaw (ſaid they) <hi>men of a great ſtature, (Numb.</hi> 13.32.) The Text is, <hi>men of meaſures,</hi> vaſt and tall men. Little things have little need of meaſuring, and 'tis ſcarce worth while to do it: But as great things are greatly to be admired, ſo they are worthy to be meaſured. How great, how marvelous is that myſtical City and Temple, whoſe meaſures were taken and ſhewed to <hi>Ezekiel</hi> in a Viſion (<hi>chap.</hi> 40.41, 42.48. <hi>v.</hi> 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35.) Such is the earth in greatneſs, that God only, who is himſelf altogether immeaſurable (and therefore greateſt of all) can lay, and hath laid the meaſures of it. <hi>Who hath laid the meaſures thereof?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>If thou knoweſt.</q>
                  <p>The Lord puts this ſuppoſition again to his queſtion; as before, <hi>Declare, if thou haſt underſtanding,</hi> ſo here, <hi>if thou knoweſt.</hi> Some read theſe words ironically, thus, <hi>Declare,</hi>

                  <p>Here it may be ſaid, what difficulty is there in this Queſtion, <hi>Who laid the meaſures of the earth? Job</hi> might eaſily anſwer, God laid them. Therefore I conceive, not only, yea not ſo much, who laid them, as how they were laid, or what they are, is here intended.</p>
                  <p>The moſt learned and ſtudied Mathematicians could never give a right meaſure of the earth, nor yet agree about that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. They meaſure it firſt as to the depth of it, what the dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:48669:40"/> of the earth is from top to bottom; but they differ much in opinion what the depth or diameter of the earth is: Some have reckoned it three thouſand and fifty miles. O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>hers have ſaid it containeth ſix thouſand and ſeventy miles. And a third ſort have concluded that it is ſeven thouſand one hundred and ſeventy miles. Thus they gueſs, but could never yet come to know the true meaſures of the earth in deepneſs. And if we conſider the <hi>Perimiter</hi> or circumference of the earth, there hath been as much variety of conjecture about that. Some of the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned have reckoned the earth fifty thouſand miles in compaſs. O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                     </note> That is one thing. A ſecond followeth
<q>Or who hath ſtretched the line upon it?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>As if he had ſaid, Who hath made the earth ſo exactly? To <hi>do a thing in print</hi> and to do it <hi>by line,</hi> are proverbials of the ſame ſignification.</p>
                  <p>The line is an inſtrument of great uſe in building. Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Maſons muſt have their line and plummet, elſe they cannot keep their work even. Now ſaith the Lord to <hi>Job, Who hath ſtretched the line upon it?</hi> The Lord ſtill purſues the alluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to a building.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To ſtretch forth the line,</hi> ſignifies in Scripture:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>The exerciſe of power.</hi> And then, Who hath ſtretched the line upon it, is, <hi>Who hath ordered and governed the earth?</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake of the line, and of ſtretching forth the line in this ſenſe (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.8.) where having ſaid, that he had power from God, a ſpiritual power, not for <hi>deſtruction, but for
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:48669:40"/> edification;</hi> he preſently adds (<hi>verſ.</hi> 13.) <hi>But we will not boaſt of things without our meaſure, but according to the meaſure of the rule</hi> (or <hi>line,</hi> as we put in the Margin) <hi>which God hath diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto us; for we ſtretch not our ſelves beyond our meaſure:</hi> That is, we are not greedy of, nor do we graſp more power than is given and allowed us of God; nor will we exerciſe our power further than Chriſt hath appointed and commanded us. This ſtretching forth of the line is the exerciſe of power, and that's a metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſenſe of it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, To <hi>ſtretch the line,</hi> is to build, or to make prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for building (<hi>Zech.</hi> 1.16.) <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to Jeruſalem with mercies; my houſe ſhall be built in it, and a line ſhall be ſtretched forth upon Jeruſalem.</hi> Again (<hi>chap.</hi> 4.10.) <hi>Who hath deſpiſed the day of ſmall things? for they ſhall rejoyce, and ſhall ſee the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel.</hi> When the Lord would aſſure his people that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhould be reſtored, he doth it by promiſing the ſtretching forth of the line, and the ſight of the plummet in the hand of <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> commanding, overſeeing, and directing the work. The line and plummet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of much and moſt neceſſary uſe for the right ſetting of a building, ſignified that God was about to build.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The ſtretching forth of the line upon a place, with ſome addition, notes the deſtruction of it, or the pulling of it down (2 <hi>Kings</hi> 21.13.) <hi>I will ſtretch over Jeruſalem the line of Samaria, and the plummet of the houſe of Ahab:</hi> That is, I will make her deſolate, as <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Samaria</hi> were; and ſo the latter part of the verſe expounds it; <hi>and I will wipe Jeruſalem as a man wipeth a diſh, wiping and turning it upſide down.</hi> Again (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 34.11.) <hi>I will ſtretch forth upon it the line of confuſion and the ſtones of emptineſs:</hi> That is, It ſhall be utterly ruined. And (<hi>Iſa</hi> 18.2, 7.) <hi>Wo to the land ſhadowing with wings, &amp;c.</hi> that ſaith, <hi>Go ye ſwift meſſengers to a Nation meted out and trodden down.</hi> The Hebrew is,<note place="margin">Ad gentem quae conculca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur &amp; deſtruitur a deo lineatim, <hi>i. e.</hi> paulatim deſtinitur cum modo &amp; ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne.</note> Go to a Nation <hi>of line,</hi> (as you have it in the Margin) that is, to a Nation who have the line ſtretched ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

As when the Lord will build, he doth it by line, that is, exactly and fully, even with a divine
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:48669:41"/> skill; ſo when he will deſtroy fully, he is ſaid to mete out for deſtruction. We have the word uſed both with reſpect to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and edification, to building up, and pulling down, in that one place (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.2.) where it is ſaid, that <hi>David ſmote Moab, and meaſured them with a line, caſting them down to the ground; even with two lines meaſured he, to put to death, and with one full line to keep alive; and ſo the Moabites became Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids ſervants, and brought gifts.</hi> Some underſtand this act of <hi>David</hi> in meaſuring the Moabites with a line, ſtrictly and lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally; that <hi>David</hi> having made a full Conqueſt of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, did cauſe it to be meaſured with a line, and then appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or allotted two thirds of the Land, together with the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, to ruin and deſtruction; receiving only the third of the people to mercy, and reſerving only a third part of the Land to be planted by them. Others take it only alluſively, that having conquered them, he uſed them and their Country at his own pleaſure, as we do that which we meaſure out by line. But whether we take <hi>Davids</hi> meaſuring the Moabites with a line in the one ſenſe or in the other, it fully reaches this third notion of it under hand.</p>
                  <p>Here in the Text when the Lord demanded of <hi>Job, Who hath ſtretched the line upon it?</hi> It is as if he had ſaid, Shew me, if thou canſt, who hath given this great building, this fabrick of the earth ſuch ſymetry, ſuch a proportion and evenneſs, that no fault or flaw can poſſibly be found in it. From theſe two figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive expreſſions in the fifth verſe, implying the exactneſs of the earths frame,</p>
                  <p>Note;
<q>The frame of the world is every way, and in every reſpect pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable and beautiful.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis done (as it were) by meaſure and line. The Lord is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely above the uſe of meaſures or lines, yet condeſcending to our underſtanding, he gives us to know that 'tis as perfect a piece as if he had done it by meaſure and by line. Survay the whole world, or any part of it, is it not a moſt exact piece? The heavens are as the roof of the houſe, the earth as the floor and foundation of it; thoſe elements aire and water, as the walls and ſides of it: The lower parts of the earth are as pillars and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:48669:41"/> baſes, hills and high mountains appear like emboſlements of the earth to the eye of the beholder. What can be added, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we conſider the compleatneſs of the whole, or the ſymetry of the parts?

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>k of God in ſpecial, his <hi>lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the meaſures of the earth,</hi> we ſhould admire both his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, wiſdom and power. There are five things in this part of the Creation, the earth, as expreſſed to be done by line and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, which may raiſe up our admiration of God.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The greatneſs of the work: It is a vaſt peece, or pile, a huge fabrick, though but a point to the Heavens. We admire great buildings; but what are the greateſt buildings upon earth, to the earth it ſelf, which the Lord hath built!</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The harmony or uniformity of the building, and ſo the beauty of it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The compactneſs of the building, as knit cloſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and ſo the firmneſs of it.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, That all was done in ſo ſhort a time. We ſay, <hi>Rome was not built in a day. Solomon</hi> was ſeven years in building the Temple (1 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.38.) And he was thirteen years in building his own houſe (1 <hi>Kings</hi> 7.1.) And doubtleſſe, <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> laid out all the power and skill he had for the ſetting up of thoſe buildings: But behold a greater building than either the Temple which <hi>Solomon</hi> built for God, or the houſe which he built for himſelf, ſet up (as we ſay) in a trice. The Lord fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed all his work in ſix dayes, and that part of it, the earth, in one: Nor did the Lord take either ſix dayes to finiſh the whole work, or one to finiſh any one part of it, becauſe he needed ſo much time to do it in; but becauſe he would not do it in leſs.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, The Lord did all this without the uſe of any inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, rule or compaſs, axe or hammer; though here is mention
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:48669:42"/> made of a meaſure and of a line. The skilfulleſt A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But ſuch is the glorious skill and power of God, that though he is pleaſed to ſpeak of a meaſure and of a line; yet we muſt not be ſo groſs, as to think that he made uſe of any. The whole work was natural to God, and therefore he needed no artificial helps; nor was any inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment employed in it, but only his own creating word and will. Some faithleſs Atheiſts of old (and poſſibly there are ſuch at this day) asked in ſcorn with what tools and inſtruments, with what ladders and ſcaffolds, this building was ſet up: But let us at once pity ſuch in their unbeliefe and horrible prophaneneſs, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to edifie or build up our ſelves in grace and holineſs, in the faith and fear of his great Name, who built this world without tools or inſtruments, without ladders or ſcaffolds.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As our hearts ſhould be drawn out in admiration, ſo in thankfulneſs, foraſmuch as God hath made ſuch a world for us: he hath laid the foundations of the earth, he hath meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it out, and ſtretched the line upon it, that we might have the uſe of it, that we might tenant and inhabit this houſe. Man is the chief inhabitant of the earth; that other creatures dwell there, is for the ſervice of man: then let us be thankful. Our greateſt cauſe of thankfulneſs is, that the Lord hath made ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther houſe for us, of which the Apoſtle profeſſeth his aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1.) <hi>We know, that when the earthly houſe of this Tabernacle</hi> (whether of our body, or of the body of this world) <hi>is diſſolved, we have a building of God, an houſe not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.</hi> O how ſhould we rejoyce in, he thankful for that houſe! But that we have this inferiour houſe built for us (which is alſo <hi>a building of God, an houſe not made with hands,</hi> but purely and immediately by the power of God) is and ſhould be continual matter of great thankfulneſs.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Seeing the Lord hath thus laid the meaſures of the earth, and ſtretched forth the line upon it; ſeeing he hath made ſuch an exact building for us, <hi>this earth:</hi> let us walk ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly and orderly upon <hi>this earth,</hi> which he hath made. As he hath laid his meaſures in framing the earth, ſo we ſhould keep our meaſures in living upon the earth. He hath ſtretched out his
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:48669:42"/> line upon it, and we ſhould take heed that we do not exceed our line. God hath given a line, by which mans converſation ſhould be ſquared as exactly as any building is or can be by line. As the work of God for us is beautiful, ſo ſhould our works be. We (as to our ſpiritual ſtate) are a Creation, a new noble Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation: And certainly, he who made the earth, this old outward Creation in ſuch exactneſs, hath alſo made the new Creation, our ſpiritual heavenly ſtate much more (if more may be) exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; he hath made it by meaſure and by line. Let us therefore walk, and ſpeak, yea, and think, by meaſure and by line; let us appear and approve our ſelves as the building of God, as the work of Gods holy Spirit, fair and beautiful. Many profeſs godlineſs; but do they appear as Gods Workmanſhip, as if God had ſtretched his line, and laid the meaſure of the New Spiritual Creation upon them? Beleevers <hi>are the Workmanſhip of God</hi> (Eph. 2.10.<note place="margin">

The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel is an exact thing, ordered in all things as <hi>David</hi> ſpake of it (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.5.) under the notion of the everlaſting Covenant. Now, ſaith St. <hi>Paul, Let your converſation be as becometh the Goſpel of Chriſt;</hi> let it be an orderly converſation: I may ſay alſo, let your converſation be ſuch as becometh the earth ye walk upon; that's an accurate frame, the Lord hath made it in meaſure, and ſtretched the line upon it: Let us take heed we be not found walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beſides that line, thoſe meaſures which he hath given us.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, If God hath been thus exact in framing the earth, as it were, by line and meaſure for us; if he hath given us ſo perfect a piece to inhabit and dwell in while we are in this ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſtate: What do you think is that paradiſe which he hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for us in our ſinleſs ſtate! VVhat are the meaſures of our heavenly City! VVhat the lines that have been ſtretched out upon thoſe eternal Manſions! If viſible things which our eye ſeeth, are ſo taking; what are things inviſible! And if this earth which we tread on, be a Looking-glaſs (as indeed it is) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we may ſee the wiſdom and power of God; what will hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven be? How will that reflect the wiſdom, power, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God? If this world be a beauty, and is therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed

I anſwer, it is nothing but the power and will of God. The will and power of God are the pillars or baſes upon which the earth is faſtened and made ſure for ever.</p>
                  <p>The word which we tranſlate <hi>foundations,</hi> is often in Scripture rendred <hi>ſockets</hi> (Exod. 26.19. <hi>chap.</hi> 35.11. <hi>chap.</hi> 38.27. <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.15.) Now ſockets are places cut in timber and ſtone, or caſt in mettal, in which the ſeveral ſtrengthning pieces of a building are faſtened; and ſuch is the foundation to a houſe, the faſtening of it. Foundations are laid in the ground, and beams are faſtened with ſockets. Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi> tranſlates; <hi>Whereupon are the foundations thereof ſunk faſt.</hi> We uſually ſay, we muſt <hi>ſink a foundation:</hi> Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations are ſunk, and then the Superſtructure faſtened on it.</p>
                  <p>Further, Take notice, The word which here we render <hi>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations or ſockets,</hi> is not that which properly ſignifieth a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And from it the word <hi>Adon</hi> is derived, which ſignifieth a Lord, or Maſter, or chief among men; becauſe Lords and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are or ſhould be as the ſockets and pillars of a Nation, to faſten and ſecure all in their places: and upon the fall of Princes often followeth the fall and ruin of Nations. The Spaniſh word
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:48669:43"/> 
                     <hi>Don,</hi> or <hi>Lord,</hi> is ſuppoſed a derivative from it.<note place="margin">Per literam, in fine additam praecedente Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets.</note> And from this Appellative, one of the proper Names of God is formed, by the addition of a letter in the end: Under which royal Title he is repreſented to our faith as the Lord and Upholder of all things. Some have obſerved, that God is called by this Name one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thirty and four times in Scripture. All which ſhew, that he who is the Creator, is alſo the Suſtainer and Supporter of the whole fabrick of Nature; ſuch is the ſignificancy of this word. Now when the Lord asks, <hi>Whereupon are the foundations thereof faſtened?</hi> There's no anſwer can be given to this queſtion, but what was given to the former. God hath faſtened them upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, in his power and will they ſtand ſure.</p>
                  <q>Or who hath laid the Corner-ſtone thereof? <hi>Or,</hi> Who hath caſt her Corner-ſtone?</q>
                  <p>As if he had ſaid,<note place="margin">

                     </note> Who made the parts of the earth to keep ſo cloſe together, and to keep up one another? This is another very conſiderable part in a building. As ſtrong buildings muſt have a ſure foundation to hold up the whole; ſo they muſt have corner-ſtones to hold the parts together. The corner-ſtone bindeth and ſtrengtheneth the fabrick, as well as gives beauty and ornament to it.</p>
                  <p>There are two ſorts of corner-ſtones:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, There is a corner-ſtone laid below or beneath in the earth with the foundation. The Maſter-builder is very careful to ſet that right.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There is a corner-ſtone laid upon the foundation, or in the joyning of the walls, both below as ſoon as the building appears above ground, and up to the top or utmoſt height of the building. Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt is expreſſed in Scripture under the notion of a corner-ſtone as to both theſe uſes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, He is the corner-ſtone laid below in the earth with the foundation (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.16.) <hi>Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation, a ſtone, a tried ſtone, a precious corner-ſtone, a ſure foundation:</hi>

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:48669:44"/> built upon the foundation of the Apoſtles and Prophets</hi> (not upon their perſons but doctrine, which is Chriſt) <hi>Jeſus Chriſt himſelf being the chief corner-ſtone:</hi>

                     <hi>In whom all the building fitly framed together, groweth into an holy Temple in the Lord.</hi> Again (1 Pet. 2.4, 5.) <hi>To whom coming, as unto a living ſtone, diſallowed indeed of men; but choſen of God and precious: Ye alſo as lively ſtones are built up a ſpiritual houſe, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some conceive, that in this place, the Lord fore-ſhewed <hi>Job</hi> the Incarnation of Chriſt, who is the true corner-ſtone, knitting all in One. For moſtly, when the Scripture would ſet forth the ſecurity of our ſalvation by Chriſt, it doth it by this reſemblance: Upon him believers are founded, and in him faſtened. If we had not Chriſt a corner-ſtone for our ſalvation, it were not poſſible that our ſalvation ſhould be ſure to us: The building cannot be fixt without it. Chriſt is ſaid to be our peace, who hath made both one (<hi>Eph.</hi> 2.14.) where the Apoſtle ſpeaks firſt of taking away the middle wall of partition, and then of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king both (that is Jews and Gentiles) one by Chriſt, the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly corner ſtone. By one and the ſame faith in Chriſt, two people, Jews and Gentiles, are joyned in one: As in the corner of a building, two walls alwayes meet and are cloſed together by the corner-ſtone. And as Chriſt is a corner-ſtone laid in with the foundation, ſo he is a corner-ſtone upon the foundation in the continued riſing of the building, till raiſed to the top. As the corner-ſtone hath its uſe in any part of the corner, from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation to the roof, ſo it is placed in the higheſt part of the building; There Chriſt is the chief corner-ſtone. The Prophet ſpeaks thus of Chriſt (<hi>Zach.</hi> 4.7.) <hi>And he</hi> (that is <hi>Zerubbabel) ſhall bring forth the head-ſtone thereof with ſhoutings, crying grace, grace unto it;</hi> which ſeems to ſignifie, that Chriſt ſhould be manifeſted and brought publickly forth, like the chief or uppermoſt corner-ſtone. The corner-ſtone is called the Head-ſtone, becauſe 'tis ſet above in the building; and 'tis called alſo the Head-ſtone, becauſe it is poliſhed, and appeareth above the reſt, like an head above the body.<note place="margin">Educet lapidem capitis. <hi>Heb.</hi> Quod inſtar ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitis promineat, aut quod emine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at in ſupremo loco.</note> Thus you ſee the uſe of the corner-ſtone in Scripture, as applied to Chriſt, in alluſion to a building, for the ſecurity and firmneſs of it: the corner-ſtone being that which bindeth the building, and faſtens the contiguous walls together. Here the Lord ſpeaking of his framing the Earth, tells us of a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner-ſtone,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:48669:44"/> to ſhew that the frame of the earth ſhall ſtand and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue unſhaken, &amp; undivided. In oppoſition to this phraſe, when the prophet deſcribeth the irreparable deſtruction of <hi>Babylon,</hi> or that it ſhall be ruined without recovery; he expreſſeth it thus (<hi>Jer.</hi> 51.26.) <hi>And they ſhall not take of thee a ſtone for a corner, nor a ſtone for foundation; but thou ſhalt be deſolate for ever, ſaith the Lord. Babylon</hi> ſhall have neither foundation nor corner-ſtone; as much as to ſay, it ſhall never be built. Magiſtrates and chief Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours are alſo called corner-ſtones (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 118.22.) <hi>The ſtone which the builders refuſed, is become the head-ſtone of the corner.</hi> Which words as they relate to Chriſt chiefly, ſo alſo to King <hi>David,</hi> as a type of Chriſt. The Scripture in ſeveral other places gives that title to great men (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.38. <hi>Judges</hi> 20.2. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 20. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.6.) In all theſe Texts Princes and great men are called <hi>corners</hi> or <hi>corner-ſtones,</hi> becauſe, as the corner-ſtone holdeth the wall together, ſo they hold Nations (in their civil capacity) together. <hi>Who laid the corner-ſtone thereof?</hi> ſaith God to <hi>Job;</hi> Tell me who did it? Didſt thou do it? Did Angels do it? Conſider the greatneſs, the firmneſs of the work; and thou wilt be convinced, that it was I that laid the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner-ſtone thereof. So then, the general ſenſe of this verſe is to ſhew the ſtability of the Work of God. Here are foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and foundations faſtened in the wiſdom and power of God, who is an everlaſting ſtrength, <hi>the rock of ages (Iſa.</hi> 26.4.) Here alſo the corner-ſtone is laid, therefore all is ſure and firm.</p>
                  <p>Now what did the Lord aime at in all this? Surely, it was not barely to convince <hi>Job,</hi> that the earth was a beautiful piece, and a ſtrong one: There was ſomewhat elſe in it; and what was that? Even to convince <hi>Job,</hi> that foraſmuch as he could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but this admirable and well ordered building, was the work of God; that therefore he ſhould ſit down ſatisfied in all his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther works. If God alone perfected this work by his power, if he contrived it by his wiſdom; ſhall man find fault with any of the works of God? Doth not he who put the world into this beautiful frame wherein we ſee it, carry on all his works on earth in beauty and order, though we ſee it not? And is there not a firmneſs and ſtrength in all his works? Is there not a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure laid in all his providences, and a line ſtretched out upon all
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:48669:45"/> his dealings with the children of men? Hath he not faſtened the foundations, and laid the corner-ſtone of all his diſpenſations right? <hi>Job</hi> ſeemed to ſpeak ſometimes, as if the Lord had not dealt with him in meaſure; nor ſtretched an equal line upon his proceedings; he looked upon all as off the hooks, and out of courſe. Now, ſaith the Lord, have I <hi>laid the meaſures of the earth, and ſtretched the line upon it? Have I faſtened the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and laid the corner-ſtone thereof? Have I done all theſe things; and doſt thou think that I will let the world in general, or any mans caſe in particular, run to ruin; as if my works of providence had neither foundation nor corner-ſtone? Remember, O Job, and well conſider, that as when in the beginning I ſaw the earth without form and void</hi> (Gen. 1.<note place="margin">

                     </note>) <hi>I, by a creating word, commanded it into form and fulneſs: So when thou ſeeſt nothing but</hi> (Tohu <hi>and</hi> Bohu) <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion and diſorder, voidneſs and darkneſs, in the earth, even then I am laying the meaſures of Juſtice, and ſtretching the line of Truth and Equity, upon all that is done or ſuffered; and will bring forth my work in full perfection: Nothing ſhall be amiſs, or out of order, when my work is finiſhed, how much ſoever it may ſeem to be amiſs, as to beginnings or preſent actings.</hi> Therefore, <hi>O Job, leave off thy complainings, and reſt quietly in my deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</hi>

                  <p>THere are two opinions among learned Interpreters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the general ſtate of this verſe:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Some here reaſſuming the firſt words of theſe queſtions propoſed at the fourth verſe by God to <hi>Job, Where waſt thou, when I laid the foundations of the earth? &amp;c.</hi> make this the ſecond inſtance of Gods mighty power in the works of Creation; <hi>Where waſt thou, when the morning ſtars ſang together, and all the ſons of God ſhouted for joy?</hi> As if the Lord had ſaid, I have as yet queſtioned thee only where thou waſt when I made the earth, which is the moſt inferiour part of the world: But now I purpoſe to riſe higher in my diſcourſe, and therefore I put theſe queſtions to thee; <hi>Where waſt thou, when I ſet up the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtars, thoſe ſparkling lights, which ſhine to the earth, through the firmament of heaven; as alſo the ſons of God, thoſe bleſſed ſpirits? all which ſang together and ſhouted for joy, at the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of my power and wiſdom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Others connect theſe words in a continued ſenſe and ſentence with the verſe going before; <hi>Where waſt thou, when I laid the foundations of the earth? &amp;c.</hi> at which ſight, <hi>the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtars ſang together, and all the ſons of God ſhouted for joy.</hi> Tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the words thus, they carry an alluſion to, or are a ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude taken from noble buildings or ſtructures, whoſe foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons uſe to be laid with ſolemnity, and their corner-ſtones to be ſet up with ſhouting and acclamation. That it was anciently cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomary,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:48669:46"/> to make ſuch acclamations at the laying of the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of ſome eminent building, beſides what is clear out of humane Authors and Hiſtories, we have ſeveral Scripture evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences. The 87<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Pſalm throughout, ſetting forth the ſtructure of the Goſpel Church, of the ſpiritual Zion, by way of prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, begins thus; <hi>His foundation is in the holy mountains;</hi> there's the foundation of Zion laid: Then followeth, as at the ſecond verſe, <hi>The Lord loveth the gates of Zion, more than all the dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of Jacob. Glorious things are ſpoken of thee, O thou City of God! Selah.</hi> As if he had ſaid, there was a great acclamation, high praiſes at the laying the foundation of Zion; with which the Pſalme cloſeth more expreſly (<hi>v.</hi> 7.) <hi>As well the ſingers as the players on inſtruments ſhall be there: all my Springs are in thee.</hi> Again (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 118.22, 23, 24.) there is no ſooner mention made of the corner-ſtone <hi>(the ſtone which the builders refuſed is become the head ſtone of the corner)</hi> but preſently we have accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations about it; <hi>This is the Lords doing, it is marvelous in our eyes:</hi> This is a bleſſed work indeed, <hi>This is the day which the Lord hath made; we will rejoyce and be glad in it.</hi> That corner-ſtone of ſalvation Jeſus Chriſt, being laid, as I may ſay, all the ſtars ſang together, and the ſons of God ſhouted for joy; <hi>This is the day which the Lord hath made.</hi> If we go to thoſe material buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings which were figurative of the Church and Chriſt, we ſhall find the like (<hi>Ezra</hi> 3.10.) When the Jewes at the return of their Captivity, began to build the Temple, the Text ſaith at the tenth verſe; <hi>And when the builders laid the foundation of the Temple of the Lord, then they ſet the Prieſts in their apparel; and with their voices, with the Levits, and the ſons of Aſaph, to praiſe the Lord.</hi> As ſoon as the foundation was laid, they were all in ſong, and raiſed up in holy rejoycings; though ſome of the old men, who remembred the firſt Temple, wept when the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this was laid. That Scripture (<hi>Zach.</hi> 4.7.) ſpeaks of the ſame thing, where the Prophet, in the Spirit, fore-ſeeing the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments of all the enemies of the people of God, thus triumphs over them by faith; <hi>Who art thou, O great Mountain, before Zerubbabel? thou ſhalt become a plain; he ſhall bring forth the head-ſtone thereof with ſhouting.</hi> That is, the building of <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> or the reſtoring of the Temple ſhall be brought to perfection; and then they ſhall <hi>cry, grace, grace, unto it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:48669:46"/>
                  <p>Now in alluſion to the practice both of men in common, and of the people of God in ſpecial, at the raiſing of great ſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures; the Lord tells us here, that when he laid the foundations of the earth, and when he faſtened the corner-ſtone thereof, there was a Triumph made: Then <hi>the morning ſtars ſang toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and all the ſons of God ſhouted for joy.</hi> Thus we have the ſtate of this verſe, either taking it for another inſtance of the power of God in creating the Stars and the Angels; or elſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning it as an acclamation to the former inſtance of the power of God; the Stars and Angels rejoycing at the laying of the foundations of the earth. And the general reaſon why the Lord b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ings in the ſtars and the ſons of God rejoycing at the laying the foundations of the earth, and finiſhing that work, we may conceive to be this; that the Lord would thereby convince <hi>Job</hi> of his murmuring and complaining, or of the unquietneſs of his ſpirit under the works of his providence. As if he had ſaid, <hi>The ſtars and all the ſons of God rejoyced at the founding of the Earth, extolling the work,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Monetur Jobus ut exemplo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelorum, dei o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pera miretur &amp; laudet, non ſugillet. <hi>Scult.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>and congratulating the appearances of my power and glory in it. Now, who art thou, that when I have put forth my power and wiſdom in this work of my providence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thee, thou ſhouldſt complain, and find fault with what I have done, inſtead of resting and rejoycing in it! Surely, O Job, thou thinkest my works of providence are imperfect, though my work of Creation was not; but conſider, was the Creation in the very firſt part of it ſuch, as cauſed all the ſons of God to rejoyce, and wilt thou, who ſayeſt thou art a ſon of God, ſit unſatisfied with any of my works?</hi> Thus the Lord handles <hi>Job,</hi> and from that teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny which the ſtars and his ſons gave of the Works of Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, reproves him for his unquietneſs under his Works of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</p>
                  <p>So much for the general ſtate of the words: Yet to clear them farther in general, before I come to the particulars, there are three veins of interpretation opened about them.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Some interpret this whole verſe concerning the ſtars or the heavenly bodies, not only taking the firſt part of the verſe literally for the ſtars in heaven; but by the ſons of God in the latter part of the verſe, they underſtand the ſtars in a figure; as I ſhall ſhew more fully, when I come to the opening of thoſe words. Thus they expound the whole verſe concerning
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:48669:47"/> the glory and praiſe which the ſtars in heaven gave to God, for the Work of Creation at the laying of the foundations of the Earth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Hieronymus. Gregorius. Beda.</note>A ſecond ſort of Interpreters expound the whole verſe of the Angels, and not of the Stars properly at all; they ſuppoſe the morning Stars to be Angels in a figure, and the Sons of God to be Angels in the letter: and ſo expound the whole verſe of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, as if the words were a deſcription only of that joy which the Angels of Heaven only expreſſed, when they ſaw God begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Work of Creation, or laying the foundations of the Earth.</p>
                  <p>The third ſort of Interpreters divide the ſenſe, expounding the firſt part of the verſe properly for the Stars, thoſe ſtuds of light, with which the Heavens are adorned, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ch (in their kind) are brought in ſinging at the Creation of the Earth; and by the Sons of God in the latter part of the verſe, they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Angels, thoſe ſpiritual ſubſtances, who are the Native Inhabitants of Heaven; they eſpecially are repreſented ſhouting for joy, when that work was begun.</p>
                  <p>I cannot adhere to the firſt ſort of Interpreters, giving all to the Stars, nor to the ſecond, giving all to the Angels (though that hath many learned Authors, who preſs it hard) but following the middle way, ſhall take the former part of this verſe, for the Stars of Heaven; and the latter, for the Angels in Heaven.</p>

                     </note>When the morning Stars ſang together.</q>
                  <p>There are ſingle Stars, and Stars (as I may ſay) in a combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, commonly called a <hi>Conſtellation.</hi> There is an Evening Star and a Morning Star (which yet are but one) called by the Greeks <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and by the Latines <hi>Lucifer, The light bringer:</hi> becauſe that Star appears very bright immediately before day-break, or before the Sun riſeth; and the ſame Star which uſhered or led in the Sun in the morning, comes behind the Sun in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and is then called <hi>Heſperus, The Evening Star.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here the Lord ſpeaks in the plural number, of <hi>the morning Stars,</hi> not in the ſingular, of a <hi>morning Star.</hi> And the Lord calls them <hi>morning Stars</hi> (ſay ſome) becauſe the Stars appear moſt clearly, and ſhine moſt brightly, near the approach of the morning, or break of the day.</p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:48669:47"/>
                  <p>Secondly, Others conceive them ſo called,<note place="margin">Sydera ſummo mundi mane, lucentia, mequ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For though (as I ſhall touch afterward) as to their perfection, the Stars were made the fourth day; yet their Creation is comprehended in the work of the firſt day, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thoſe general words (<hi>Gen.</hi> 1.1.) <hi>In the beginning God cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated the Heavens and the Earth;</hi> the Heavens contained all the Stars in their materiality, though not yet formally produced; for the Stars being but the thicker part of the Heavenly Orb, when the Heavens were made, the Stars were alſo made: and may therefore be called <hi>Morning Stars,</hi> as being made in the Morning of the World, early made.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, They may be called <hi>Morning Stars,</hi> becauſe they (according to their manner) expreſt their joy early or betimes in the Morning of the World, or as ſoon as the Lord had laid the foundations of the Earth. Thoſe things which are done early,<note place="margin">Qui mane ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid aggrediun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur opus <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutini</hi> dicuntur.

                     </note> are done in the morning; and they who do things in the morning, have the denomination of the morning upon them. The Poet anciently ſaid <hi>Aeneas</hi> was <hi>(Matutinus) A Morning Man,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was early at his work; ſo theſe may be called <hi>Morning Stars,</hi> becauſe they were early at work, ſinging the praiſe of God. Thus the reaſon why the Wolf hath this Epithite, <hi>An Evening Wolf,</hi> is becauſe he doth his work, he comes forth for his prey, in the evening (<hi>Hab.</hi> 1.8. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.3.) In the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Prophet, the Chaldean Horſe-men are compared to <hi>Evening Wolves,</hi> for fierceneſs; and in the latter, the Judges of <hi>Iſrael</hi> are ſet under the ſame compariſon, for blood-ſucking cruelty. And as thus, upon different accounts, ſome are called <hi>Morning Men,</hi> others <hi>Evening Men;</hi> ſo 'tis upon no good account, that any are called <hi>Night-men,</hi> though the general reaſon of it be the ſame with the former, becauſe they do their bad work, or works of darkneſs, under the ſhadow and favour of the Night. The Thief, the Murderer, the Adulterer, are <hi>Night-men,</hi> all theſe are wont to do their work in the Night (<hi>Job</hi> 24, 13, 14, 15, 16.) Thus there are men of the <hi>Night,</hi> men of the <hi>Evening,</hi> and men of the <hi>Morning,</hi> or <hi>Morning Men.</hi> In this ſenſe the Stars may be called <hi>Morning Stars,</hi> becauſe they were ſo early at that beſt work, the praiſes of God. <hi>When the Morning Stars</hi>

                  <p>I anſwer, 'Tis frequent in Scripture to attribute acts of life to liveleſs creatures, and acts of reaſon to thoſe things which have no ſenſe.

We find all the creatures cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to ſing the praiſe of the Lord quite through the 148<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Pſalm, <hi>Praiſe him Sun and Moon, praiſe him all ye Stars of light:</hi> There's the ſpecial inſtance of the Text. <hi>The Heavens declare the glory of God, and the Firmament ſheweth his handy-work</hi> (Pſal. 19.1.) There is a kind of dutiful conſpiration among all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, even among the inanimate Creatures, in their places to praiſe God. And if you ask how they praiſe God? or how they ſing? I anſwer in general, <hi>after their manner,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">More ſuo.</note> as they are able, or as is ſuitable to their condition. The Stars ſing not formally (and yet ſome ſay, there is a harmony in the motions of the Heavens; which being ſo conſtant, concordant, and uniform, hath a kind of Muſick in it) but though they cannot praiſe God formally, yet,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, They do it <hi>Materially:</hi> That is, they are that matter,<note place="margin">In caeleſtibus corporibus am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plior occurrit dei collaundandi materia; ideo &amp; illis cantus ſeu laeta procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matio ſeu ova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio figurate tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buitur. <hi>Merc,</hi>
                     </note> for which God is to be praiſed, they being ſuch excellent and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble creatures. <hi>The work praiſeth the Workman.</hi> That which is well done, commends the Doer of it, though all tongues be ſilent. In this ſenſe, the Stars ſing the praiſe of God: They ſing the praiſe of God, as they are the objects of his praiſe; or, as they provoke Men and Angels to praiſe God for making them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, They praiſe God Vertually, or equivalently, they ſhew how praiſe-worthy God is.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, When we ſay the Stars praiſe God, it intimates, there is ſo much excellency in the Works of God, that if the Stars could ſpeak, they would declare and ſhew forth his praiſe. When the Diſciples of Chriſt rejoyced, and praiſed God with a loud voice, for all the mighty works which they had ſeen; ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Bleſſed be the King that cometh in the Name of the Lord, peace in Heaven, and glory in the Higheſt</hi> (Luke 19.37, 38.) The envious Phariſees did not like the Muſick, and therefore <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aid to him from among the multitude, <hi>Maſter, rebuke thy
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:48669:49"/> Diſciples</hi> (verſ. 39.) To theſe moroſe Maſters, Chriſt anſwered (<hi>verſ.</hi> 40.) <hi>I tell you, that if theſe ſhould hold their peace, the ſtones would immediately cry out.</hi> As if he had ſaid, you labour in vain to ſuppreſs or hinder the teſtimony given me by my Diſciples; for if they ſhould be ſilent, the ſtones would cry ſhame of them, for neglecting their duty: and God would rather cauſe ſenſeleſs creatures to proclaim his praiſe, in giving me an honourable teſtimony, than I ſhould want it. Now as there was ſuch a worth in the work of Redemption, and in all the works of the Redeemer, while here on Earth, that the ſtones would have ſhewed forth his praiſe, if men had not: So there is ſuch a worth in that Work of God, the Creation of the Earth, that rather than God ſhould not have the glory of it, the Stars would have done it by breaking out into joyful ſinging.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, As Birds praiſe God by their ſinging, ſo Stars may be ſaid to ſing the high praiſes of God by their ſhining, by their brightneſs, by their motion, by their influence; for all which God is to be praiſed and glorified.</p>
                  <p>And hence we may infer, If not only irrational, but inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate creatures ſing the praiſes of God, at leaſt, by giving occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his praiſe; then how much more ſhould men ſet forth his praiſe, who are not only living, but reaſonable creatures! and if creatures without life and reaſon ſhould provoke mankind in general, as having life and reaſon to praiſe God; how much more, ſhould godly men be provoked by them to ſing his praiſe, they having not only life, which Stars have not; and reaſon, which Birds and Beaſts have not; but grace, which the moſt of men have not! Among viſible creatures, Men have moſt reaſon (becauſe they have reaſon) to praiſe God, and among Men, Godly Men have moſt reaſon to praiſe God, becauſe they have Grace. And therefore as ſoon as ever <hi>David</hi> had ſaid, <hi>All thy works ſhall praiſe thee, O Lord</hi> (Pſal. 145.10, 11.) he adds in the next words, <hi>and thy Saints ſhall bleſs thee, they ſhall ſpeak of the glory of thy Kingdome, and talk of thy power.</hi> As if he had ſaid, As all thy works, O Lord, praiſe thee, ſo Saints (who are the choiceſt pieces of thy workmanſhip) have cauſe to do it, more than, and above all: they cannot but be ſpeaking and talking of thy Kingdome and Power, which are very glorious. Upon which account, the tongue of Man, eſpecially the tongue of a
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:48669:49"/> Godly Man, is called <hi>his glory; I will ſing and give praiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi> (ſaid <hi>David,</hi> Pſal 108.1.) <hi>even with my glory.</hi> What is that? his tongue, the chief bodily inſtrument of divine praiſes. The Stars in their courſes once fought againſt the enemies of God (<hi>Judg.</hi> 5.20.) and they alwayes in their places ſing the praiſes of God: Let it not be ſaid that Saints are ſilent.</p>
                  <p>So much of theſe words, as the Stars are taken properly.</p>
                  <p>There are ſome (as I ſaid before) who take theſe Stars meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorically or figuratively for the Angels, and then their ſinging is proper; and there are two reaſons given, why by the ſtars in this place, we ſhould underſtand the Angels.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, If we conſider the truth or courſe of the Hiſtory, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Earth being created the firſt day, the Stars were not in being till the fourth day; unleſs we comprehend them (as was ſaid before, as to their matter and reallity) under thoſe words of <hi>Moſes, In the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth:</hi> but as to their appearance and formality, ſo they were not till the fourth day; and if ſo, how could they ſing the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of God at the laying of the foundations of the Earth? A ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond reaſon is given from this Chapter, becauſe God ſpeaks of the Stars afterwards (<hi>verſ.</hi> 31, 32.) <hi>Canſt thou bind the ſweet influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Pleiades</hi> (the ſeven Stars ſo called) <hi>or looſe the bands of Orion, &amp;c.</hi> Here the Lord treats with <hi>Job</hi> about the Stars in proper ſenſe, therefore probably the Morning Stars here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, are not to be taken properly, but tropically, for the Angels.</p>
                  <p>And the Angels may very well be called Stars, or Morning Stars, by a Metaphor, becauſe of their ſpiritual beauty and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, in which they out-ſhine all the Morning S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ars, yea that ſpecial Morning Star, commonly known by the Name of <hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,</hi> or <hi>Light-bringer.</hi> Though the Angels have not a viſible bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily beauty, yet they have a better beauty than any body. 'Tis ſaid of <hi>Stephen</hi> (Acts 6.15.) when he ſtood before the Council, <hi>They beheld his face as it had been the face of an Angel.</hi> Angels (being Spirits) have no viſible faces; but becauſe Angels are, in their nature and qualities, beautiful creatures, therefore <hi>Stephen</hi> having an extraordinary beauty ſtampt upon him, is ſaid to have the face of an Angel. And as beautiful perſons may be ſaid to look like, or reſemble Angels; ſo Angels may be ſaid to
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:48669:50"/> look like, or reſemble Stars. The Church for the luſtre of her graces, is ſaid, <hi>to look forth as the Morning, fair as the Moon, clear as the Sun</hi> (Cant. 6.10.) and ſo may the Angels as the Stars. The Apoſtle ſaith of thoſe falſe Apoſtles (who would needs be accounted Stars (faithful Miniſters of Chriſt) in the Firmament of the Church) they are transformed into Angels of light (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.14.) that is, they would appear like Angels of light. The holy Angels are Angels of light. The ſeven Stars are the ſeven Angels, ſaith Chriſt, expounding the Viſion to <hi>John</hi> (Revel. 1.20.) This ſhews that Angels and Stars have a ve y great ſimilitude; ſo that, as there in one ſenſe, ſo here in another, the Stars may ſignifie the Angels. And the Angels may very well be called <hi>Morning Stars,</hi> becauſe they were the firſt of living Cre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>If any ask how the Angels are the Sons of God? I anſwer</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Negatively, They are not the Sons of God, as Jeſus Chriſt is. Angels became the Sons of God in time; Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God from Eternity. The Apoſtle (<hi>Heb.</hi> 1.5.) puts the queſtion, <hi>To which of the Angels ſaid he at any time, thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee?</hi> The Angels are the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated Sons of God; Jeſus Chriſt onely is his onely begotten Son.

But Jeſus Chriſt alone is the Son of God by Na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ure, or by an eternal generation, and was ſo declared in the fulneſs of time, both by his Incarnation and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection; which many conceive to be the Apoſtles intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in thoſe words, <hi>This day have I begotten thee;</hi> taken out of the ſecond Pſalm, and quoted (<hi>Acts</hi> 13.33.) as alſo (<hi>Heb.</hi> 1.5.)</p>
                  <p>Secondly, In the Negative, The Angels are not the Sons of God by Regeneration, nor by Adoption. Thus Believers only are the Sons of God (<hi>John</hi> 1.12.) <hi>To as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the Sons of God, even to as many as believed on his Name.</hi> Believers are the Sons of God, rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated and adopted; Angels are not ſo. The holy Angels need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not Regeneration; nor as they were created holy, ſo they fell not from that holineſs in which they were c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:48669:51"/>
                  <p>I anſwer, Affirmatively, The Angels may be called the Sons of God in a ſixfold ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, As <hi>Adam</hi> is called the Son of God (<hi>Luke</hi> 3.38.) in his primary Conſtitution or by Creation; ſo Angels are the Sons of God, as they are his Creatures.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Angels are called the Sons of God, becauſe of Gods great affection to them, as well as his creation of them. Such as we much affect and love intrinſically, we are ready to call our Children, Sons or Daughters: The Lord bears abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of love to the Angels, therefore he calls them his Sons.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If we conſider their place or ſtation: The Angels wait upon God, they are near to him, they ſtand about his Throne as Sons, to receive his Bleſſing and Commands.</p>
                  <p>There are three things ſpecially conſiderable in the Angels:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Their Nature, ſo they are Spirits, or ſpiritual Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Their Offices, ſo they are the Meſſengers and Miniſters of God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Their Dignity or nearneſs to God, ſo they are his Sons. <hi>Chriſt the onely begotten Son, is in the boſome of the Father, (John</hi> 1.18.) that is, he is neareſt him, and hath moſt inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate communion with him: The Angels are ſo near to God, that (though they are not in his boſome, yet) <hi>they alwayes behold his face (Matth.</hi> 18.10.) that is, ſtand in his preſence, as being in high favour with him; and are therefore in that reſpect called his Sons.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Angels may be called the Sons of God, becauſe of that conſtant uniform obediential frame that is in them, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God. <hi>A Son honoureth his father, (Mal.</hi> 1.6.) It ſhould be the diſpoſition, and in the heart of every Son to do ſo. And ſeeing it is not only fully the diſpoſition of Angels, and in their hearts to do ſo, but they have alwayes actually done ſo, (the holy Angels may truly ſay unto God, as the elder bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is brought in ſaying to his father (<hi>Luke</hi> 15.29.) Lo, theſe many years, even ever ſince the Creation, we do ſerve thee; neither have we tranſgreſt at any time thy commandment, either by leaving undone what thou haſt bidden us do, or by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what thou haſt forbidden us) therefore Angels having the genuine ſpirit of Sons towards God, may in that regard alſo be ſtiled the Sons of God.</p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:48669:51"/>
                  <p>Fifthly, They may be called the Sons of God, becauſe of their eſſential likeneſs to God, or their likeneſs to him in Eſſence. God is a Spirit, he is incorporeal; the Angels alſo are incorporeal, they are Spirits; though the difference between God and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels be as great as can be conceived, yea, unconceivable; God being the <hi>Creating Spirit,</hi> and they but created Spirits; God being an Infinite Spirit, and they but finite Spirits; yet the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels bear a reſemblance to God in their eſſence, as well as in their qualifications, and may upon that ground likewiſe be called the Sons of God.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Angels are called the Sons of God, becauſe they imitate him. <hi>Do good to them that hate you</hi> (ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.44.) <hi>that ye may be the Children of your Father, which is in Heaven:</hi> that is, imitate God, carry it towards evil men, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men that are evil to you, or do you evil, as God doth; and this will be both an evidence, that you are the Sons of God, and God will honour you with the Title of his Sons. The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels imitate God in mercy, and love, and compaſſion, as alſo in their good works, their ways being all holy, juſt, and good, pure and righteous. Further they ſhew much kindneſs and tenderneſs to the children of men; they doubtleſs, are patient towards the fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and do good offices (as they are called and deputed) to thoſe who deſerve little good. Now being like God by imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they may be called the Sons of God. Thus we have ſome account in theſe particulars, why, or how the Angels are called the Sons of God. But what did theſe Sons of God, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, when Spectators of the Worlds Creation? The Text tells us,<note place="margin">Signanter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtris tanquam inferioribus laudem, Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis tanquam ſuperioribus attribuit Jubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lationem. <hi>Aquin.</hi>

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:48669:52"/> a confuſed noiſe or ſhout, for fear and ſorrow. But moſtly and moſt properly, the word ſignifies to ſhout for joy, and in a way of triumph, as when an army is victorious, and ready to divide the ſpoil; or as in the time of harveſt or vintage, when the fruits and good things of the earth are gathered in: and ſuch is the ſhouting here intended. The Angels, the Sons of God, did not only ſing as the Stars, when the foundations of the Earth were laid; but they <hi>ſhouted for joy.</hi> It is but one word in the Hebrew, which we render, <hi>ſhouted for joy.</hi> The Angels did not onely approve, but applaud the works of God.</p>
                  <p>Further, Conſider the generality of this divine <hi>Plaudite,</hi> or applauſe, <hi>All the Sons of God ſhouted for joy.</hi> As before the Lord ſaith, <hi>The Stars ſang together;</hi> ſo here, <hi>All the Sons of God;</hi> not one of them was left out, every one bare a part in this triumph; they all with one accord, with one heart, and one voice, joyned in it: <hi>All the Sons of God</hi> (there was not one diſſenting voice) <hi>ſhouted for joy.</hi> Hence</p>
                  <p>Firſt, I might refute their opinion who denied Angels and Spirits, as the Sadduces did (<hi>Acts</hi> 23.8.) but I ſhall not ſtay upon that.</p>
                  <p>Further, It being ſaid, <hi>All the Sons of God ſhouted for joy:</hi>
                  </p>

That which is the work of one, is the work of them all, and they ſhould all joyn in it. And how ſad is it, to ſee thoſe who call themſelves, and would be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the Sons of God, divided in their work and way! when one rejoyceth in that which to another is cauſe of mourning; when <hi>one mans meat is</hi> (as we ſpeak proverbially) <hi>another mans poyſon;</hi> or one mans comfort, another mans grief? How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are there who cannot joyn in rejoycing and thanksgiving for works of God (I mean Providential Works) as eminent in their kind, as the Creation Work, or the laying of the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Earth? That will be a bleſſed day, when we ſhall ſee the full effect of that propheſie (<hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.9.) <hi>Then will I</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>turn to the people a pure (Lip</hi> of) <hi>Language, that they may all call upon the Name of the Lord, with one conſent or ſhoulder.</hi> Here's a promiſe of all as one, and of all with one conſent, ſhoulder, inward, outward man, aſſociated in prayer, or calling upon the Name of the Lord; which by a Synechdoche, includes all the parts, and takes in the whole compaſs of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God. The accompliſhment of this propheſie, was the ſcope of Apoſtolical Prayer (<hi>Rom.</hi> 15.5, 6.) <hi>Now the God of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and conſolation grant you to be like minded one towards another; according to,</hi> or (as the Margin hath it) <hi>after the example of Chriſt Jeſus; that ye may with one mind, and with one mouth, glorifie God, even the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> All the Sons of God in the Text were of one mind, and had (as it were) but one mouth, the joy of one was the joy of them all. All the Sons of God on Earth have this principle in them, to rejoyce in God, and to magnifie God for his mercy; onely all have not the ſame light: They that have not an habitual principle in them, to praiſe God in and for his works, are not of his family; they are not worthy to be reckoned Sons of God, who have not a readineſs, or preſent diſpoſition in them, to joyn with all, or with any of his true Sons, in ſhouting for joy at his gracious appearances in his mighty works of mercy; as alſo in humbling themſelves toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with them, at the terrible appearances of his dreadful works of Judgement, or at the uſual prognoſticks or fore-runners of them.</p>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:48669:53"/>
                  <p>Again, Taking <hi>the Stars for the Angels,</hi> they were Morning Stars; the Angels ſang and ſhouted for joy, in the Morning.</p>
                  <p>Hence, Obſerve;
<q>The very firſt appearances of the power and wiſdom of God in his works, ſhould put us upon the work of praiſe and rejoycing.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>We ſay truly, better late than never; but 'tis beſt to be early, and with the firſt, in a good work. <hi>David</hi> did not onely awake early, or in the morning, to praiſe God; but as the Hebrew may be rendred, <hi>he awakened the morning</hi> (Pſal. 57.8.) <hi>David was a morning man in praiſing of God;</hi> ſo were the Angels. 'Tis healthful both for ſoul and body to be morning men, to be early, both in praiſing God, and praying to him. God requires, and he infinitely deſerves the firſt fruits of our time, our youth, which is the morning of our life, the firſt fruits of our age, ſhould be dedicated to God (<hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.1.) and ſo ſhould the morning, which is the youth (if I may ſo ſpeak) of every day. Our firſt thoughts ſhould be of God and with God; as ſoon as we awake, we ſhould ſet open the door of our hearts by meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to let God in, and knock open the doors of heaven by prayer and ſupplication to get in to God. It ſhould not be unlament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the courſe of moſt men runs ſo contrary to this; their ſenſes are no ſooner looſed from the bands of ſleep, but they let looſe their thoughts, and ſet the doors of their ſouls wide open to ſenſitive, ſometimes to wicked and ſenſual objects; and ſo ſhut out God and matters of greateſt moment, to and about their immortal ſouls. How unworthy are ſuch of this bleſſed relation, under which the Angels, thoſe early praiſers of God, are here repreſented, <hi>Sons of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, In that it is here ſaid, <hi>All the Sons of God ſhouted for joy,</hi> that is, all the Angels then created:</p>
                  <p>Obſerve;
<q>They who have joyned in ſome outward worſhips of God, may yet fall off and apoſtatize.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here all the Angels of God joyned in this thanksgiving at firſt, yet ſoon, very ſoon after, a great part of the Angels rebelled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, and became Apoſtates; for preſently upon the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:48669:53"/> of man, which was the ſixth day, there was a Devil, a Tempter, who overthrew man; yet here we have all the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in a holy Quire. Hypocrites are forward to joyn in acts of praiſe, in acts of prayer, in acts of hearing, who yet in time of temptation fall away, and ſo fall into as bad a condition as the fallen Angels; of whom the Apoſtle <hi>Jude</hi> ſaith (<hi>verſ.</hi> 6.) that not <hi>having kept their firſt eſtate (or principality) but leaving their own habitation</hi> (appointed them of God) <hi>he hath reſerved them in everlaſting chains</hi> (both of Providence and Juſtice) <hi>under dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, unto the Judgement of the Great Day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Obſerve;
<q>The great buſineſs of Angels, and that which they are moſt bent to, is to praiſe God <bibl>
                           <hi>(Pſal. 103.20. Pſal. 148.2. Iſa. 6.3.)</hi>
                        </bibl>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as at the birth of the World the Angels ſhouted for joy, ſo at the birth of Jeſus Chriſt (who was the Author of the ſecond Creation, as well as of the firſt) the Angels ſhouted for joy: <hi>ſuddenly there was with the Angel a multitude of the heavenly hoſt</hi> praiſing God (<hi>Luke</hi> 2.13.) To praiſe God is heavenly work, 'tis angelical work, the moſt proper work of the Sons of God. We ſhall not alwayes have need of praying, but we ſhall alwayes have cauſe to be praiſing and ſhouting for joy: This ſhout will remain to all eternity. Praiſe is the moſt ſpiritual work, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires the moſt ſpiritual frame of heart; and therefore the chief of that work is reſerved to an eſtate, wherein not only our ſouls, but our bodies too, ſhall be altogether ſpiritual.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Note;
<q>The Work of Creation ſhould continually call up our thoughts to the praiſe of God, to ſing and ſhout his praiſes.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Did the Stars (take them properly) and did the Sons of God (the Angels) rejoyce when the work firſt began? and is not the work to be rejoyced in now 'tis finiſhed? Though ſin hath ſulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the work, yet the glory of God is ſtill tranſparent in it, the power, goodneſs, and wiſdom of God are gloriouſly ſeen in the things that are made (<hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20.) not onely were they ſeen, but they are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>hold the inviſible things of God, even his eternal
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:48669:54"/> Power and God-head, ſo that they who glorifie him not in and for thoſe works, will be found and left without excuſe: They are a book, a volume, conſiſting of as many leaves and lines as there are diſtinct ſorts of creatures, wherein we may read the great God plainly deſcribed to us: and if ſo, let us remember our fault this day; Is it not our ſin and ſhame, that we are ſo little in admiring God for this work, which ſet all the Angels in heaven a ſinging, a ſhouting, a wondring? There are ſeveral things in the Works of Creation, which well conſidered, will ſoon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke us to ſinging and to ſhouting. Firſt, The multitude of Creatures. Secondly, The various kinds of Creatures. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, The beauty and excellency that is in the Creatures. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, The profit and the uſefulneſs of the Creatures. Theſe laid together, ſhould draw out our praiſes, and cauſe us to exalt the power, wiſdom and goodneſs of God manifeſted in and by his Creatures.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Conſider what was i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> that cauſed the Angels to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>y, when they ſaw this wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>k of God begun? Surely it was the appearance or manifeſtation of God, ſhining brightly in the Work of Creation.</p>
                  <p>Hence Obſerve;
<q>The diſcoveries of the power, wiſdom, and goodneſs of God, ſhould ſtir up, and engage every man, and cannot but effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually ſtir up and engage thoſe who are wiſe and good, to rejoyce in God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Somewhat of God is ſtamped, or there are certain lines of his tranſcendent perfections drawn upon every Creature; here a line of wiſdom, and there a line of power; here a line of goodneſs, and there a line of mercy; the ſight of theſe ſhould cauſe us to ſhout for joy; eſpecially, that this God, the Creator of the ends of the Earth is our God for ever and ever, and will be our guide even unto death. How many lines have we of God in the World, which we have not read, much leſs ſtudied and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented upon! In how many things is God viſible, and yet we ſee him not, nor acknowledge him as we ought? Take onely theſe two things by way of inference from the whole.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>To be of a praiſing, of a rejoycing ſpirit, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>o be of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent ſpirit, of an angelical ſpirit.</hi> Let us imitate <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he Angels in
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:48669:54"/> praiſing God. The Angels are called the Sons of God, becauſe they imitate him; let us imitate the Angels in praiſing God, ſo ſhall we approve our ſelves the Sons of God too.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Conſider, The Angels rejoyced at the laying of the foundations of the Earth. The Earth was made for man; Heaven was the Angels habitation, they were well provided for, if there had never been an Earth, they had been provided for; yet they ſhouted for joy, when God laid the foundations of the Earth for the uſe of man and beaſt.</p>
                  <p>Hence take this Inference;
<q>It ſhews a good ſpirit, to rejoyce at the good of others, or to be pleaſed with that which is beneficial to others, though it be no benefit to us.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This argues an excellent ſpirit, an angelical ſpirit. Some if they are well houſed and provided for, care not whether others are houſed and provided for or no; nor can they rejoyce at the good of others, but as their own good is concern'd. In glory we ſhall be like to the Angels, our very bodies ſhall be like to the Angels, living without food, without ſleep<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; in Heaven we ſhall neither marry, nor be given in marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age; but ſhall be like the Angels. O let us ſtrive to be like the Angels in our minds now, as we hope to have our bodies like the Angels hereafter, even clothed (as the Schoolmen call them) with angelical endowments. Unleſs our ſpirits are like the Angels here, unleſs we have hearts like the hearts of Angels in this World, we ſhall never have bodies like them hereafter, or in the World to come.</p>

                  <p>THe Lord having queſtioned <hi>Job</hi> about the Fabrick of the Earth, and ſhewed the triumph and acclamations of Angels at it, in the former Context: He next leads him to the waters, or carrieth him to the Sea, there to conſider his Works of wonder. As <hi>Moſes</hi> in the beginning of <hi>Geneſis</hi> having ſummarily and in general, ſpoken of the Creation of Heaven and Earth, deſcendeth to particulars; ſo here we have the Lord paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from one part of the Creation to another; from the Creation of the Earth, to that other great part of the Creation, the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, or the Sea. Verſ. 8. <hi>Who ſhut up the Sea with doors? &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In theſe words, we have</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The Creation of the Sea.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Its Conſtitution: both ſet forth by moſt elegant Metaphors.</p>
                  <p>The Creation or Production of the Sea, is ſhadowed by allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to an Infant breaking forth out of the womb (<hi>Verſ.</hi> 8.)</p>
                  <p>The Conſtitution or ſettlement of the Sea, is carried on in ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Metaphors to the end of the eleventh Verſe.</p>

                     <bibl>
                        <hi>Verſ. 8.</hi>

                  <p>We have here,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The Birth or Nativity of the Sea.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, What God did with the Sea, when it was born,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:48669:55"/> and iſſued out of the womb: Then God ſhut it in with doors, and prepared garments and ſwadling bands for it; then he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained the rage, force, and fury of it, and held it as his priſoner or captive in bonds. As ſoon as an Infant is born, it is bound up and ſwadled; and as ſoon as the Sea (as I may ſay) was born or come into the World, God took order with it; and to keep it in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, he provided doors to ſhut it in, and garments to bind it up with.</p>
                  <p>What the Scripture ſpeaks of Gods coercing the Sea, may be reduced to two heads:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To that reſtraint which he laid upon the Sea, preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon its Creation, ſome ſay the firſt, others the third day of the Creation; according to that (<hi>Gen.</hi> 1.9.) <hi>God ſaid, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear; and it was ſo.</hi> Thus the Lord reduced it to a certain place.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, To that reſtraint which God laid upon it, after this reducement, that it ſhould no more return, to overflow the Earth. Both theſe reſtraints or laws put upon the Sea, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in this Context; the former of them in the eighth and ninth verſes: As ſoon as the Sea iſſued out of the Earth, God ſet up its doors, and made it bands. The latter of theſe, the giving of a ſpecial Law, that when it was ſhut in, it ſhould no more break forth, but according to his appointment, we have in the tenth and eleventh verſes, where it is ſaid, <hi>I brake up for it my decreed place, and ſet bars and doors; and ſaid, hitherto ſhalt thou come, and no further; and here ſhall thy proud waves be ſtayed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So then, here we have;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Bounds and limits aſſigned by God to that vaſt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly Element, the Water, that the Earth might be habitable and uſeful both for man and beaſt. And,</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We have the Lord reſtraining all power or liberty (which naturally it would have had and taken) to violate or break thoſe bounds: For had not God given the Waters of the Sea ſuch a ſpecial command (though bounds had been aſſigned them) they would quickly have broken their bounds.</p>
                  <p>Theſe two orders of God differ much, though not in the time when they were given out, yet in the nature of the thing; and
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:48669:56"/> both ſuppoſe the Sea in being, when theſe orders were given out; For when it is ſaid (<hi>verſ.</hi> 8.) <hi>It brake forth, as if it iſſued out of the womb;</hi> this implieth its birth and nativity: and when God ſaith, <hi>He ſhut it up with doors,</hi> this ſuppoſeth, that it not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had a being, but that it was violent and furious, and would have over-flowed all, and regained as large a Territory as it poſſeſſed at firſt, when it iſſued out of the womb of the Earth, even the face of the whole Earth, if the Lord had not bridled and reſtrained it.</p>
                  <p>Yet further, and more diſtinctly to open the words in their Order.</p>

The Sea brake forth out of the bowels of the Earth, as out of a womb. The Earth is the Common Parent, the Parent of the Sea; the Sea was created in the bowels of the Earth; or the Earth was created big with the waters of the Sea, as a woman big with child, and ſhortly after the Lord cauſed the earth, like a woman with child, to travel and b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ing forth the Sea. So that the Lord doth here more diſtinctly open to us the manner of the Creation of the Sea, than in the firſt of <hi>Geneſis.</hi> It is true, the Element of Water hath its ſeat naturally above the Earth, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the lighter Element; but as to the firſt conception of it, this Scripture implies, that its place was within the Earth, and that it iſſued forth from the Earth. The bowels of the Earth were the womb in which the Sea was conceived, and out of which, by the Word of the Lord, it iſſued. The waters were not at firſt created above the Earth (as ſome have affirmed) but they being created with the Earth, and conceived within the Earth, brake out of the Earth, and inveſted or covered it all over; and ſo continued in that condition till the third day, and then the Lord commanded them to retire into certain vaſt channels, now cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Sea, that ſo the dry land might appear. Thus the Lord, when the waters were iſſued forth, diſpoſed of them in their proper place. According to this Interpretation, we are to take theſe words of the time paſt; <hi>Who is he that ſhut up the Sea with doors, when it brake forth?</hi> that is, after it had broken forth, after it had iſſued out, <hi>Who was he that then ſhut it up with doors?</hi> This deſcription of the Nativity of the Sea, may be drawn out into theſe conclu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ions:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>The Earth and Waters were created both together.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>The Waters were at first created within the bowels of the Earth;</hi> for ſaith the Text, <hi>They iſſued forth, they brake forth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>At the Command of God, the Waters were brought forth out of the Earth, as a Child out of the Mothers Womb</hi> (Pſal. 33.7.) <hi>He gathereth the waters of the Sea together as an heap, he layeth up the deep in ſtore-houſes</hi> (Pſal. 104 <hi>verſ.</hi> 5, 9.) <hi>Bleſs the Lord, &amp;c. who
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:48669:58"/> laid the foundations of the Earth, that it ſhould not be removed for ever; thou coveredſt it with the deep as with a garment: the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſtood above the Mountains.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>The Waters being thus brought forth, did at firſt cover the Earth, and ſo would have continued, if God had let them alone.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the method of Nature things lie thus:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The earth is loweſt, being the groſſeſt element.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The water riſeth above the earth, as being more pure than that.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The air is above the water, as being much more pure than the water.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The fire gets above all, as being the thinneſt and pureſt of all the elements; and therefore the water iſſuing out of the earth, would have continually covered the face of the earth, if the Lord by his power had not ordered it off, and ſhut it up with doors, when come off, according to our read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the words in this verſe, and according to the general reading of the tenth verſe; where the whole earth being covered with water, the Lord brake up for it his decreed place, and there kept it faſt. Thus <hi>David</hi> (Pſal. 104.7, 8.) ſpeaking of the waters above the mountains and over-flowing all; preſently adds, <hi>At thy rebuke they fled, at the voice of thy thunder they haſted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; they go up by the mountains, they go down by the vallies, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the place which thou haſt founded for them.</hi> There the Lord by <hi>David,</hi> as here by himſelf, ſets forth his mighty power, in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of the waters to a certain place.</p>
                  <p>But if we take that other reading of this verſe, <hi>Who hath an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed the doors of the Sea?</hi> then by <hi>doors</hi> we are not to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that which ſtops the Sea from over-flowing the earth, as in the tenth verſe; but for thoſe paſſages at which the waters brake out of the earth, as an infant from the womb; which ſeems moſt diſtinct and clear.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe the Sea is ſo huge a body, ſo great a part of the world, we may (not unprofitably, I hope, before I paſs from this verſe) conſider a three-fold repreſentation of the Sea, or the Sea as a glaſs ſhewing us three things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The Sea hath in it a repreſentation of God himſelf in his divine perfections.</p>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:48669:58"/>
                  <p>Secondly, Of the World in its various motions.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Of the heart of man in its vileſt corruptions.</p>
                  <p>The Sea carrieth in it, Firſt, A repreſentation of God himſelf; which may be taken in four things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, In the hiddenneſs and unſearchableneſs of his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.6.) <hi>Thy judgements are a great deep, or a ſea;</hi> (Rom. 11.33.) <hi>O the depth of the wiſdom and counſel of God! how unſearchable are his judgements, and his wayes paſt finding out!</hi> None can fathom this Sea, there is not line enough in the underſtanding of Men and Angels to reach the bottom of God; he is a ſea without banks or bottom.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Lord is as the ſea in his goodneſs, ſending out ſo many ſweet ſtreams, and feeding all the ſprings of the earth (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 65.9, 10.) <hi>Thou viſiteſt the earth and watereſt it, thou greatly inricheſt it with the river of God, which is full of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; thou prepareſt them corn, when thou haſt ſo provided for it: thou watereſt the ridges thereof abundantly, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, As all the rivers come from the ſea, and return to it, ſo all good flows out and ſprings from God, and all the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his goodneſs ſhould return, or be returned to him in praiſes and thanksgivings.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The ſea is ſuch a vaſt body, that though it ſends forth water to feed the earth every where, and though all the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers flow back into the ſea, yet the ſea is not at all abated by the water that it ſends forth, nor increaſed by all the water that returns to it. So how much ſoever God gives out to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (he gives out all) yet he is no more emptied by it than the ſea; and whatſoever returns the creature makes to him, they no more increaſe nor add to him, than the ſea is increaſed by the rivers falling into it: there is no ſenſible appearance of the heightening of the waters of the ſea, by the greateſt and vaſteſt rivers that disburden themſelves into it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As the ſea is an Emblem of the Living God, in whom we live, ſo of the world wherein we live.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The ſea is a very unquiet part of the world. What ſtorms, what tempeſts are there upon the ſea? what rage and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the waves of it? ſuch an unquiet thing is this world, hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying up and down, and inraged often by ſtorms and tempeſts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing from the luſts and paſſions of men, even to the ſwallowing up of all.</p>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:48669:59"/>
                  <p>Secondly, The ſea is very unconſtant, it is now ebbing, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non flowing. It is ſo with this world, and all things in it; our comforts are ſometimes flowing, and ſometimes ebbing; our peace comes, and anon it goes; we have ſome good dayes and more evil; the dayes of darkneſs are many, and the beſt meet with many of them in this world; the world is full of changes, the faſhion of it paſſeth away.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The ſea water is a ſalt water, an unpleaſant water; and ſuch is the world, though many drink greedily of it, and would even draw it up, as the Scripture ſpeaks of <hi>Behemoth,</hi> drawing up <hi>Jordan.</hi> They who drink in worldly things, as if they could drink up the whole world, yet drink but ſalt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant water.<note place="margin">A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>guſtine.</note> One of the Ancients notes it as a great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to man, that God doth thus imbitter the world to us, making it brackiſh and diſtaſtful. And indeed God hath on purpoſe tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered the things of this world, that they ſhould not be too ſweet and luſcious for us, or leſt we ſhould diſtemper our ſelves by them, or ſurfeit upon them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Sea is an Emblem of the heart of man, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of a wicked mans heart. Man is a little world, and the heart of man hath a ſea of worldly vanities in it (<hi>Iſaiah</hi> 57.20.) <hi>The wicked are like the troubled ſea;</hi> and the heart of a wicked man is the moſt troubled and troubleſome part in him. The heart unchanged, is like the ſea:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, For turbulency or troubleſomneſs; what is more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet than the heart of man? no ſuch natural ſtorms upon the ſea; no ſuch civil ſtorms either at ſea or land, as there are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſtorms in the heart of man; what a ſtir, what broils, doth the heart of man make many times!</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The heart of man is like the ſea, as it is ſalt, brackiſh and bitter, through the haſtineſs and raſhneſs of our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. The Prophet <hi>Habakkuk</hi> calls the Chaldeans a bitter and haſty Nation (<hi>chap.</hi> 1.6.) Haſty perſons are bitter perſons, perverſeneſs, peeviſhneſs and paſſions lodge in them.</p>

                     </note> I return to conſider what the Lord ſaid further, concerning the Sea Natural.</p>
                  <q>
                     <bibl>
                        <hi>Verſ. 9.</hi>
                     </bibl> When I made the cloud the garment thereof, and thick darkneſs a ſwadling band for it.</q>
                  <p>As ſoon as the child is born and come into the world, the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or Midwiſe provides ſutable garments for it, and a ſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling band. Thus the Lord continues the metaphor of child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth; I, ſaith the Lord, provided a garment and a ſwadling band for the new-born ſea. And as the Text tells us, that the Lord made the ſea a garment, and a ſwadling band, ſo it tells us what they were: What was the garment made for the ſea? The Cloud. When the Lord had ſeparated the ſea from the earth, he made the clouds to cover it, as garments do a child, that comes naked into the world; and the cloud is a fit garment for the ſea. Clouds are water condenſed, and they diſſolve into wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and here the Lord having ſeparated the ſea from the earth, made the cloud, which is a kind of ſea, a ſea in the air, as a garment to cover and keep it warm. And becauſe a new-born child, leſt the limbs ſhould not grow right, hath not the liberty of its arms and feet for a time; but is wrapt up with a ſwadling band: therefore, in purſuance of the Allegory, the Text ſpeaks of a ſwadling band prepared for the ſea, as ſoon as it was born. But what was the ſwadling-band of the ſea? As the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of its garment is a cloud, ſo its ſwadling-band is <hi>thick darkneſs;</hi> that is, ſay ſome, very dark clouds; making this latter part of the verſe but a repetition of the former: becauſe clouds are dark in themſelves, they are often expreſſed by darkneſs, they are called black clouds, and dark clouds, yea, ſometimes clouds are called <hi>darkneſs.</hi> So that the cloud, and the thick dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:48669:60"/> may be the ſame; onely it is here expreſt in different terms, to ſhew the exactneſs of the Lords proceeding, and the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateneſs of his providing for the due ordering of the unruly child the ſea. And that the ſea had at firſt ſuch a ſwadling-band, we find (<hi>Gen.</hi> 1.2.) <hi>Darkneſs was upon the face of the deep.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence, Firſt, From the purpoſe of the Spirit of God, as we may well conceive, in repreſenting the ſea in ſuch a dreſs, a child in ſwadling-bands:</p>
                  <p>Note;
<q>God can as eaſily rule and bind the ſea (a vast bulky body) as a mother or a nurſe can bind a little infant in ſwadling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And ſurely the Spirit of God would have us to take notice, that though the ſea, be indeed ſuch a giant, ſuch a monſter, as will make a heart of oak ſhake, or a heart of braſs melt, yet what is it to God, but an infant? he can bind it and lay it to ſleep, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as a little child. And if the great ſea be in the hand of God as a little child, what is great to God! and how great is God! What is ſtrong to God! and how ſtrong is God! What or who is too great, or too ſtrong for God to deal with? Cannot God, who hath ſwadled the turbulent ſea, provide ſwadling-bands to wrap up the ſtouteſt and moſt turbulent ſpirits of this world? <hi>Job</hi>

                     </gap>aking of himſelf, wondered that God ſhould deal ſo with him (<hi>chap.</hi> 7.12.) <hi>Am I a Sea or a Whale, that thou ſetteſt a watch over me?</hi> The ſea is a boiſterous creature, and had need be watched; <hi>Am I a Sea or a Whale,</hi> ſaid <hi>Job?</hi> Though a man be as a ſea or a whale, God can watch him, and bind him from doing miſchief. Therefore fear not any power of the creature, though a great ſea, while your behaviour is good; but fear the Lord, who binds the ſea to its good behaviour. <hi>Nations are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him but as the drop of a bucket (Iſa.</hi> 40.15.) A Nation confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in it ſelf, is a mighty ſea, much more <hi>The Nations,</hi> which indefinite is univerſal, taking in all Nations; yet they are all but as the drop of a bucket: and how eaſily can we diſpoſe of the drop of a bucket? Even ſo eaſily can God diſpoſe of thoſe who are as the ſea in opinion and appearance.</p>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:48669:60"/>
                  <p>Secondly, Conſider what the Lord makes the ſwadling-band of the ſea; ſome ſtrong thing no doubt: the Text tells us it is but a dark cloud or a miſt ariſing from the ſea; theſe are the bands with which God binds this mighty giant the ſea.</p>
                  <p>Hence Obſerve,
<q>The Lord can make weak and improbable means to do and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the greateſt things.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>One would think we ſhould have heard of ſome other matter, even of adamantine chains, to bind the Sea with; but we ſee miſts and fogs and clouds ſhall do it, if God will. Miſts are but vapours gathered up and thickened a little in the air. Is it not a wonder, that they ſhould get the upper hand of, and bind the ſea? ſo that as ſoon as a miſt riſeth in the air, by and by the ſea is ſtill. There is indeed a natural reaſon why, as calms are ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome without miſts, ſo miſts can never be without calms; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe miſts cannot endure nor live in the wind, much leſs in a ſtorm, but muſt preſently be diſperſed or blown away by it; yet 'tis much, that a miſt, or a fog, or a cloud in the air, ſhould have a binding force upon the ſea. This was the Lords work, to keep the ſea quiet in its place. And having conſidered this, we are called to conſider another Work of God, whereby he keeps the ſea from roving out of its place, in the two verſes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
                  <q>
                     <bibl>
                        <hi>Verſ. 10.</hi>
                     </bibl> And brake up for it my decreed place, and ſet bars and doors, &amp;c.</q>
                  <p>Here the Lord ſpeaks of the ſecond ſtate of the ſea, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to one reading, though according to ours of the firſt.</p>
                  <p>When the Lord had ſaid, <hi>Let the waters be gathered together into one place,</hi> he prepared a place to receive the waters; as when a man would have a place to hold water, he digs or makes an earthen veſſel or receptacle for it. So when the waters iſſued out of the earth in their nativity, the Lord gathered them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into a ſea, and prepared a ſtupendious pit; or as ſome fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the alluſion here of a new-born infant wrapt in ſwadling-bands, he provided a great bed or cradle to put it into. That vaſt concave into which the waters are put, is ſomewhat like a cradle; thoſe channels (I ſay) which God made for the ſea, are
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:48669:61"/> as the cradle wherein it is laid. The banks and ſhores are thoſe bars and doors with which the infant is kept in his cradle. What can be ſpoken more ſignificantly than theſe ſimilitudes, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the greatneſs of God, who keeps in the ſea by his power, and leads it forth gently into ſeveral creeks and boſoms, for the ſafety of Naviga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>The ordering and placing of all things is of God, as well as the making of them; God hath provided a place for every thing, and put every thing in its place. God is the God of Order. And how comely and orde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ly are all things, while they are kept in, and all perſons while they keep in the place which God hath decreed for them, and put them in! The Elements do not ponderate, are not bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſome in their place. The ſea troubles us not while it keeps or breaks not out from that decreed place, which God at firſt brake up for it. There is not the leaſt worm, but hath a decreed place. And as God hath appointed men their time (there is a decreed time for their birth, and for their continuance in life, they die alſo, and go out of the world in a decreed time) ſo there is a decreed place for every man, and that two-fold:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Of his habitation, in what part of the world he ſhall live (<hi>Acts</hi> 17 26.)</p>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:48669:61"/>
                  <p>Secondly, Of his ſtation, or vocation, what part he ſhall act in the world, to ſerve his generation, or to get his living. He that abides within the bounds of his calling, abides in his place, though he every day move or remove from place to place. It is beſt for our ſelves and for others alſo to abide in our decreed pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; as it is a mercy to us all, that the ſea abides where God placed it. If men break out of their places, they may quickly do miſchief like the breach of the ſea: To prevent which <hi>God brake up for it his decreed place, and</hi> not only ſo, but as it followeth in the cloſe of this tenth verſe,
<q>Set bars and doors.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the eighth verſe we have only doors; he hath ſhut up or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed the doors of the ſea; but here we have <hi>bars and doors.</hi> It is an alluſion to ſtrong Cities and Caſtles, or to great mens Houſes, which have not only doors, but doors barred and double lockt. Bars ſtrengthen doors, and keep them faſt and ſure. A ſtrong door, if not well lockt and barred, may quickly be broken open; therefore the Lord to make all faſt, tells us that when he had put the ſea into his decreed place, that it ſhould no more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to cover the earth at its own pleaſure, or according to its natural bent (for there is a deſire, that is, a natural bent in the ſea to be over-flowing all, and to repoſſeſs the place from which it was at firſt with-drawn; the Lord I ſay tells us that) he then ſet <hi>doors and bars to keep it in,</hi> and ſhut it up faſt enough. And if you enquire what is meant by theſe doors and bars, with which 'tis ſhut in? Some anſwer, The ſands of the ſea, others the rocks, clifts and banks; theſe are bars and doors by which the ſea is ſhut in. But though theſe things are indeed as bars and doors to keep the ſea from returning again; yet that which is the great bar and door, is the word of command from God, as appears fully in the next verſe.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, <hi>He ſaid,</hi> as noting the facility of the work. When the Lord took a courſe to ſhut up theſe doors, and to put on theſe invincible bars, what did he? He ſaid it, and it was as ſoon done as ſaid; ſo that this word <hi>He ſaid,</hi> notes the infinite ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty and power of God, that by a word ſpeaking the matter was done; <hi>He ſaid,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The Lord gives the ſea line; He makes it a priſoner, but not a cloſe priſoner; He gives it a great ſcope, large room to role and tumble its waves in; <hi>Hitherto thou ſhalt come,</hi> that is, hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto thou maiſt come. It is not a Command that the ſea ſhould alwayes come ſo far, but it is a diſpenſation or a permiſſion, that thus far the ſea may come, but no further.

                     <q>But no further.</q>

                  <p>Why doth the Lord call them proud waves? it is not becauſe they are proud properly, but by a Metaphor; they lift up their heads as proud men do, and are therefore called <hi>proud waves.</hi>

The word rendred waves properly ſignifies a <hi>heap;</hi> becauſe waves role in heaps one upon the neck of another.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, In that this Text makes ſo particular a deſcription of the proviſion which God made to keep the ſea in order; as ſoon as it was born, he bound it up in ſwadling-bands, and then brake up a decreed place for it, and there ſet up bars and doors, that it ſhould come no further. He put the ſea under confinement.</p>
                  <p>Hence, Note;
<q>The ſea left to it ſelf, would miſchief all; the ſea would return and cover the earth quickly.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>As ſoon as ever it brake forth out of the earth, it covered the earth; and ſo it would do again, if the Lord ſhould let it alone. <hi>David</hi> took ſpecial notice of this work of God (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.9.) <hi>Thou haſt ſet a bound that they</hi> (the waters ſpoken of <hi>verſ.</hi> 6, 7, 8.) <hi>cannot paſs over, that they turn not again to cover the earth.</hi> Which plainly implieth, that the waters would turn again to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the earth, and ſo recover their firſt liberty, even to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread the face of the whole earth, did not God reſtrain and hold them in, as was ſhewed before in the general explication of this verſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Note;
<q>The creature can go no farther than God permits or ſuffers.</q>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:48669:63"/>
                  <p>Rational creatures often go beyond the commands of God; but neither they, nor any creature, can go beyond the counſel of God: They who tranſgreſs or paſs over the line of his revealed will, cannot paſs over the line of his ſecret will. The Lord ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly puts a ſtop to all creatures, as here, to the ſea. How ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant ſoever mens ſpirits are, or their practices are, yet they are under an over-ruling power. The ſea hath continued under this command ever ſince God made it; it hath gone no further than the Lord would. Though it be a truth that the ſea hath bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken viſible and natural, yea artificial banks, and bounds, and bars; yet it hath never broken thoſe ſpecial inviſible banks, bounds, and bars,<note place="margin">Deus non ſibi eas rerum leges fixit quas neque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at ad tempus cum libot mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

When God gave the ſea viſible banks, and bounds and bars, he did not intend them for banks, and bounds, and bars to his own will; and therefore he ſometimes bids the ſea go beyond and break its viſible bounds and bars. He commanded a general deluge in <hi>Noahs</hi> time; then all was ſea, no dry land appeared: And though we have the Lords promiſe that he will never deſtroy the world, how ſinful ſoever, by an univerſal deluge any mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e (<hi>Gen.</hi> 9.11.) yet Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories and experiences have told us there have been many parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular inundations of the ſea, breaking its anciently known bounds and bars; nevertheleſs it never did nor ever ſhall break the bars of this word, <hi>hitherto ſhalt thou come, but no further.</hi> The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine pillar of this <hi>(Ne plus ultra) No further,</hi> ſtands inviolable. If the ſea break bounds at any time, 'tis becauſe God hath given it a ſpecial commiſſion to do ſo, for the puniſhment of men, who break their bounds by ſin. The ſea is ſtill Gods priſoner, and goes not out of thoſe doors which God hath ſet up and barred, without his licence; it ſtirs not a foot from the decreed place which God broke up for it, but as he lengthens its chain.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Note;
<q>To God alone that power belongs, which keeps the ſea within compaſs.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is not the ſands, nor the banks, nor the rocks, that can do it. The water is a very barbarous and head-ſtrong element, none can put a bridle into the lips of it, but God himſelf. A late Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, ſpeaking of the ſiege of <hi>Rochel,</hi> ſaith there was a ſtupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:48669:63"/> dike made, which might be <hi>called a bridle to the ſea:</hi> but God alone can make a bridle for the ſea; his word in the Text, <hi>Hitherto ſhalt thou come, and no further,</hi> is the bridle. Some di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute whether it be not a continued Miracle, that the ſea is kept within its compaſs. We ſay miracles are diſcontinued; and I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive 'tis beſide the nature of a miracle, to be continual; yet, without diſpute, 'tis a continued marvel or wonder, that the ſea is thus kept in; if the Lord ſhould let it looſe, if he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the bar and unlock the door of that prohibition here given it, but one hour, no natural doors nor bars could hinder it from returning to cover the face of the earth. Take a few inferences from the whole.</p>
                  <p>Firſt,
<q>The ſea is Gods, and he hath made it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>(Pſal. 95.5.) And he made it, as to declare his own glory, ſo to promote our good (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.25, 26.) <hi>The earth (O Lord) is full of thy riches; ſo is this great and wide ſea, wherein are things creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing innumerable, both ſmall and great beaſts; there go the ſhips; there is that Leviathan whom thou haſt made to play therein.</hi> O magnifie God, who hath made the ſea ſo vaſt, ſo wide, ſo great, yet ſo uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and commodious. As the ſea is a terrible creature, ſo a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial creature, bringing forth and feeding an innumerable company of beaſts, as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks. We may as ſoon num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the ſands, as the ſhoals of fiſh bred and nouriſhed in thoſe mighty waters.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,
<q>As the ſea is the Lords, and he made it; ſo the ſea is the Lords, and he maſters it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>(Pſal. 89.9.) <hi>Thou ruleſt the raging of the ſea; when the waves thereof ariſe, thou ſtilleſt them.</hi> Glorifie the Lord in this. No earthly potentate can coerce the ſea. <hi>Xerxes</hi> preſumed he could tame the <hi>He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eſpont,</hi> a little brook comparatively to the Ocean, but it would not obey him; he diſciplined it with three hundred ſtroaks for attempting his bridge of boats, but it would not mend; he caſt fetters into it, as if it had been his vaſſal, but it would not be bound. It is God who binds the ſea, That knows no Lord but him that made both it and the dry land. It was
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:48669:64"/> proof enough of Chriſts Divinity, that <hi>rebuking the winds and the ſea, there was a great calm.</hi> This made <hi>the men marvel, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, what manner of man is this</hi> (ſurely he is more than man) <hi>that even the winds and the ſea obey him</hi> (Matth. 8.26, 27.) When ſome Courtiers would have flattered our Daniſh King <hi>Canutus</hi> into a belief that his power was more than humane, he commanded his chair to be ſet on the Sea-ſhore at the time of flood; and ſitting down, thus beſpake that Element; <hi>I charge thee not to enter my land, nor wet theſe robes:</hi> but the ſea keeping on its courſe, he roſe up, and ſpake in the hearing of all about him; <hi>Let all the inhabitants of the world know, that vain and weak is the power of Kings; and that none is indeed worthy of that Name, but he that keeps both heaven, and earth, and ſea in obedience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Then tremble at the power of God, who can let the ſea looſe upon us in a moment. We tremble at the ſea if it break looſe; then tremble at the power of God, who can let looſe the ſea. <hi>It is he that calleth for the waters of the ſea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth: the Lord is his Name.</hi> (Amos 9.6.)</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, when the ſea breaks bounds in any degree, either when we ſee a ſtorm at ſea, or a deluge at land, let us go only to the Lord, who onely can ſtill the raging of the ſea, and put ſwadling-bands about it, even as if it were a child. God alone is to be invocated, when the winds are tempeſtuous, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en either a deluge at land, or a wrack at ſea. Heathens invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked <hi>Neptune</hi> and <hi>Aeolus.</hi> Popiſh votaries call upon St. <hi>Nicholas</hi> and St. <hi>Chriſtopher.</hi> Let us learn of the Diſciples, who fearing to be ſwallowed up of a tempeſt, went to Chriſt, and ſaid, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, ſave us, we periſh</hi> (Matth. 8.27.) The poor Mariners in <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi> called every one upon his God (<hi>Jorah</hi> 1.5.) but none of them called upon the true God. It is <hi>Jehovah</hi> the Lord, the true God onely, <hi>that raiſeth the ſtormy wind, which lifteth up the waves of the ſea; and it is he that maketh the ſtorm a calm</hi> (Pſal. 107.24, 25, 29.)</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, If the ſea, ſo vaſt and violent a creature receive the bridle from God, and is bound up by him, even as an infant in ſwadling-bands; how much more ſhould man receive the bridle from him! The Lord ſaith to the ſons of men, hitherto ſhall ye come, and no further; hitherto your works and actions ſhall go,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:48669:64"/> and no further: yet how do the men of the world over-flow and break their bounds! The prophet makes this application clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (<hi>Jer.</hi> 5.22, 23.) <hi>Fear ye not me, ſaith the Lord? will ye not tremble at my preſence? which have placed the ſand for the bound of the ſea, by a perpetual decree, that it cannot paſs it; and though the waves thereof toſs themſelves, yet can they not prevail; though they roar, yet can they not paſs over it: but this people hath a revolting and a rebellious heart, they are revolted and gone.</hi> As if he had ſaid, <hi>The ſea doth not revolt againſt my command, but this people doth;</hi> they are more unruly than the ſea. <hi>All the wicked, at beſt, are like the troubled ſea, that cannot reſt</hi> (as the Prophet ſpeaks, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.20.) How much worſer then are they than the ſea, when they are at worſt?</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, We may hence infer for our comfort; If the Lord hath put bounds to the natural ſea, what unnatural ſea is there, to which the Lord cannot put bounds? There is a five-fold me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorical ſea, to which the Lord hath ſaid, <hi>hitherto ſhalt thou come, and no further:</hi> Or, at leaſt, he hath ſaid, though thou come hither, thou ſhalt come no further. This the Lord hath ſaid,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To the ſea of mans wrath. The wrath of man is a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous ſea, and of that <hi>David</hi> ſaith (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 76.10.) <hi>The wrath of man ſhall praiſe thee, the remainder of wrath ſhalt thou reſtrain.</hi> Let men be as angry as they will, let them be as ſtormy as a ſea; yet the Lord hath ſaid, hitherto ſhall ye come, and no further: For (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 65.7.) <hi>He ſtilleth the noiſe of the ſeas, the noiſe of their waves, and the tumult of the people.</hi> Yea, great men raging like the ſea, are ſometimes ſtopt by very ſmall matters, ſuch as the ſea-ſands. The Chief-prieſt and Elders of the people, were offended at Chriſt, and therefore queſtioned his Authority; yet forbare to anſwer his queſtion, as they had moſt mind to do it, for fear of the people (<hi>Matth.</hi> 21.23, 26.)</p>
                  <p>Secondly, He bounds the ſea of the devils rage. The devil is a ſea in bonds. We read of a ſpecial thouſand years, wherein it is propheſied that Satan ſhall be bound (<hi>Rev.</hi> 20.2.) yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he is alwayes bound, elſe no man could live a quiet hour for him, nor have any reſt from his furious temptations and vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but his profeſſed ſlaves and votaries.</p>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:48669:65"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, There is a ſea of Affliction which we meet with in this world; the Lord bounds that alſo, and ſaith, hitherto it ſhall come and no further (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13) <hi>There hath no tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation taken you, but ſuch as is common to man. But God is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, who will not ſuffer you to be tempted above that you are able; but will with the temptation alſo make a way to eſcape, that you may be able to bear it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The Lord ſets a bound to the ſea of prophaneneſs and ungodlineſs in the world; that's a ſea that would over-flow all; and that is a ſea, f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

No, ſaith the Lord, it was not, 'tis not thou that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeſt the morning, it is I that command the morning. I commanded the firſt morning (<hi>Gen.</hi> 1.5.) I ſaid, <hi>Let there be light, and there was light; and the evening and morning were the firſt day.</hi> It was I, who the fourth day, ſaid, <hi>Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven, to divide the day from the night; and let them be for ſigns and for ſeaſons, for days and for years. It was I that made two great lights (the Sun and Moon) the greater light to rule the day, and the leſſer light to rule the night, (Gen.</hi> 1.14, 15, 16.) The firſt morning, and all the mornings,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:48669:66"/> the light-bearer, or the light-bringer, came forth and appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at my command, not at thine. <hi>Haſt thou commanded the morning</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Haſt thou commanded the morning ſince thy days?</hi> That is, ſince thou cameſt into the world? haſt thou had the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, priviledge, and power to awaken and call up the morning, as thou doſt thy houſhold ſervants? Know, O <hi>Job,</hi> that, as there was a morning before thou waſt born, or hadſt a day in the world; ſo <hi>ſince thy day,</hi> thou haſt neither made the morning, nor raiſed up the morning light; that power is now in my hand, as it was before thou waſt in being; thou art but of yeſterday, of a few days: there was a morning before thy days; and ſince thy days many have continued and come forth daily: yet not at thy command, but at mine. As I brought forth the light in the firſt day of the Creation, ſo the fourth day I created the Sun, into which I gathered the light, and at whoſe riſing the morning ſhews it ſelf.</p>
                  <q>Hast thou commanded the morning ſince thy days?</q>
                  <p>'Tis a daring Queſtion; thou haſt not, I have done it, and not thou.</p>
                  <p>Hence Note, Firſt,
<q>What God will have done, he can command to be done, or it ſhall be done at his command.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Lord needs not labour to produce the moſt difficult ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects; he can produce them as a Lord, by a word ſpeaking; he needs not intreat, nor treat about the bringing forth of any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:48669:67"/> his will is enough to bring it forth. What God will have done, ſhall be done. Thus it was at the beginning, when God created all things, and gave them a being; and thus it hath been ever ſince for the moving of all things to their ſeveral ends, and iſſues, to this day; all hath been done by a word of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. <hi>David</hi> (Pſal. 148.) calling the Sun, Moon, and Stars, to praiſe the Lord, gives that as the reaſon (<hi>verſ.</hi> 5.) <hi>for he commanded, and they were created.</hi> Now, I ſay, as they were cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated at the firſt by his command, ſo they ſhine forth every day by the ſame command (<hi>Matth.</hi> 5.45.) <hi>He maketh his Sun to riſe on the evil and on the good.</hi> He that hath power, uſually ſaith to a perſon that is unwilling to do a thing, <hi>I will make you to do it;</hi> that is, you ſhall do it, whether you will or no. And 'tis ſaid by the Evangeliſt, <hi>He maketh his Sun to riſe, &amp;c.</hi> which may ſeem to import a kind of unwillingneſs in the Sun to beſtow its light promiſcuouſly upon the evil as well as good (evil men are indeed unworthy that the Sun ſhould ſhine or the rain fall upon them) but God (who is infinite in goodneſs, and to ſhew that our good deeds ſhould not be ſhut up or narrowed to thoſe onely who are good) layeth an irreſiſtible and an indiſpenſible charge upon the Sun, to riſe and ſhine with that indifferency to the good, and to the bad. The Sun would be aſhamed to ſhine upon wicked men, the Sun would even with-hold its beams, and rays, and deny them light or any comfort, it would not make the earth fruitful for them, had it not a command from the Lord: But having a command from him, it cannot with-hold nor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert its light, no not from thoſe who are children of darkneſs, and have conſtant fellowſhip with the unfruitful works of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                  <p>'Tis no ſmall matter of conſolation, to remember, that our God is a commanding God, that he can command the morning: which as it is a truth, with reſpect to the natural morning of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day, ſo to the myſtical or metaphorical morning. After a dark, black, and ſtormy night of ſorrow and trouble upon his Church or People, then the Lord can command the morning of joy and proſperity to ariſe upon them and comfort them. 'Tis comfortable living under and obeying his commands, who can command away our ſorrows, and by a word ſpeaking turn mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night into morning, and the ſhadows of death into the ſhining
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:48669:67"/> light of life; and therefore ſaith peremptorily without <hi>ifs or ands</hi> (Pſal. 30.5.) <hi>Weeping (or ſorrow) may endure for a night, but joy (or ſinging) cometh in the morning:</hi> that's a morning in a morning. We may have a morning of Sun light, and no morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of joy-light, as the Lord threatned his people in caſe of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience (<hi>Deut.</hi> 28.6, 7.) <hi>In the morning thou ſhalt ſay, would God it were even; and at even thou ſhalt ſay, would God it were morning, for the fear of thy heart, wherewith thou ſhalt fear, &amp;c.</hi> Onely God can make a morning of joy or inward light, to riſe with the mo ning light of the natu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>al day; elſe we may have day without us, and darkneſs within us; Sun-light but no ſoul-light. And ſuch was the intendment of that dreadful threatning againſt the wicked, laſt mentioned out of <hi>Moſes.</hi> Whereas the godly in their darkeſt ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>us, and gladneſs for the upright in heart.</hi> And God can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand that light to ſpring even in the hour and power of darkneſs, as Chriſt expreſſed his ſaddeſt day in this world (<hi>Luke</hi> 22.53.) The light of every morning is called the day-ſpring, at the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end of this verſe; and the Lord can make light and gladneſs, or the light of gladneſs to ſpring up in our hearts, when and where he pleaſeth.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Obſerve;
<q>The courſe of Nature in all its turns and changes, is moved by, and obedient to the command of God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>As God commands the morning, ſo the morning fails not to come at his command. When did you ever know the morning ſtop or ſtay a moment beyond the time, that God commanded it to come forth. We could never ſay to the Chariot of the Sun, as the Mother of <hi>Siſera</hi> ſaid of his, <hi>Why is his Chariot ſo long a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming? why ſtay the wheels of his Chario<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>?</hi> There was ſomewhat ſtopt <hi>Siſera</hi>'s Chariot, that it could not come; and God took off the Chariot wheels of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> in the Red Sea, and they drew heavily; yea, the Lord can take off the Chariot-wheels of any, though they drive as furiouſly as <hi>Jehu,</hi> ſo that they ſhall not come at their time: but who ever knew the morning ſtopt a minute or a moment beyond the exact time at which it ſhould come, or was expected? And as the Sun, ſo all natural things,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:48669:68"/> keep their courſe, and ſlack not at the command of God. No creature diſobeys the command of God but man, who of all creatures hath moſt reaſon, and is moſt obliged to obey it. God never ſaid of the Sun, O that it had hearkned to my voice; but the ſons of men put him often to ſay ſo, as he once did to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> his ancient people (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.13.) How ſeldome do we keep time with God! How ſeldome do we come or go, juſt at his call! <hi>I have called</hi> (ſaith Wiſdome, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.24, 25.) <hi>and ye refuſed, I have ſtretched out my hand, and none regarded.</hi> God never looked, one day of the year, for the morning, and it came not; but he hath come three years (as the Parable of the Fig-tree ſhews, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.) to man, looking for fruit, and hath found none. Will it not ſhame us, that the morning is obedient to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God, if we are not?</p>
                  <p>And the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>efore as the former note was matter of comfort to us, ſo this may be matter of conviction to us, that the morning, that the Sun in the firmament (a liveleſs creature) receiving a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, ſhould conſtantly appear at the time which the Lord ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points, and that we, who are living creatures, that we, who are reaſonable creatures, yea, that we, who have not only reaſon, but grace (all believers have) ſhould not be obedient to, and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of the Lords command, to come at his time, to appear at his call; how may it cauſe us to bluſh for ſhame! The Prophet ſaith, <hi>The Stork in the heavens, the Crane, the Tu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

I may ſay alſo, the Sun, Moon and Stars, thoſe lights in the heavens, know their ſeaſon, and the time of their coming; they obey the command of the Lord, and ſhall not we know the judgement of the Lord, and obſerve the appointed times of our duty! which to obſerve, is as much our intereſt or benefit, as it is our duty. As often as we ſee the morning coming according to the command of God, let it provoke us to make haſt, and not delay, to keep his commandements.</p>

                  <p>This command of God hath reſpect, not onely to his bringing forth the light every morning, or to his bringing forth the morning light every day into the world; but to his giving the light its being the firſt day of the world.

And ſurely there is no creature where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we may ſee and contemplate more of God than in the light, which he made the firſt day, and now commandeth to make the morning day by day.

The commonneſs of it leſſens our eſteem of it; and becauſe it comes ſo conſtantly, and never fails, we are apt to look upon it as no great matter, as no great mercy; whereas indeed the light is not onely uſeful and comfortable, but admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; and that it deſerves theſe three attributes, I ſhall briefly ſhew; by giving a touch at each of them.</p>
                  <p>That, light is an admirable creature, muſt be confeſſed, if we conſider,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Its original, or the way of its production. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle treating about ſpiritual light, tells us whence the natural light came (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6.) <hi>God who commanded light to ſhine out of darkneſs, &amp;c.</hi> Light came, as it were, out of the womb of darkneſs. Now that, out of darkneſs, black darkneſs, ſuch a beautiful child, ſuch a goodly creature as light ſhould be brought forth, is it not marvellous? Yet thus it was, God <hi>commanded light to ſhine out of darkneſs.</hi> The Hiſtory of the Creation reports, <hi>There was nothing but darkneſs upon the face of the earth,</hi> when the Lord ſaid, <hi>Let there be light.</hi> Darkneſs is totally contrary to
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:48669:69"/> light, 'tis the privation of light: Now, that the habit ſhould come forth out of the privation, light out of darkneſs, or life out of death, joy out of ſorrow, peace out of trouble, theſe are the wonderful works of God. And we may comfortably meditate upon this, when we want any kind of light: Whence did the Lord bring light at firſt? even out of darkneſs; therefore let us not think any darkneſs of trouble, a le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Secondly, Light is wonderful, in its operation, power, and efficacy, in that it doth ſo ſuddenly chaſe away, conquer, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome darkneſs. Light gets victory over darkneſs in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. There's no darkneſs can abide the face of light.

                  <p>Fourthly, The light is very wonderful in the changes and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſitudes of it. How it paſſeth and repaſſeth, how it increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth and decreaſeth, how it comes and goes, is an amazing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Though the light be in continual changes, yet there's nothing more conſtant than the light, to its appointed time. Light never fails to come in its ſeaſon.</p>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:48669:69"/>
                  <p>Secondly, That light is a moſt uſeful and beneficial creature, who can deny? ſeeing without light the whole Creation were a nothing to us. What had the world been to us, if God had not made light, and ſet up lights in it? The eye of the body (whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h is <hi>the light of the body,</hi> Matth. 6.22.) were of no uſe to us without outward light. Till the Sun (which is the eye of the great world) ſhines, the eye (which is the Sun of the little world) is no advantage to us. There muſt be light in the aire, as well as light in the eye, elſe the moſt beautiful objects have no appearing beauty; and therefore the Lord made light the firſt day, that by it, the beauty of the whole Creation might be ſeen. Light diſcovers it ſelf and all other things: Light illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates all the works of God, and ſets them in our ſight. And as all that God hath done, would be nothing to us without light, ſo we our ſelves could do nothing without light. We cannot work at all, or very hardly, or very badly, without light; hence that of <hi>David</hi> (Pſal. 104.22, 23.) <hi>The Sun ariſeth; man goeth forth to his work and to his labour, until the evening.</hi> (John 9.4.) <hi>The night cometh, wherein no man can work.</hi> Night of any ſort, is not for work, becauſe 'tis dark; and therefore they who work in the night, get artificial light to ſupply the want of natural. When the plague of darkneſs was upon the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> they ſate ſtill, and no man moved from the place where he was, till that plague was removed (<hi>Exod.</hi> 10.22, 23.) And as we cannot do the work of our Civil Callings without light, either natural or artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial; ſo we cannot do the work of our Chriſtian Calling, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpiritual light. When <hi>Christ the Sun of righteouſneſs ariſeth with healing in his wings, then we go forth</hi> (to our ſpiritual labour as Chriſtians) <hi>and grow up as the calves of the stall</hi> (Mal. 4.2.) How long ſoever we live in this world, we never go forth to that labour, till the Sun of righteouſneſs, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth upon us. It was ſaid to thoſe in the parable, that were hired at the eleventh hour (<hi>Matth.</hi> 11.6.) <hi>Why ſtand ye all the day idle.</hi> They of the eleventh hour were perſons, poſſibly, very bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie and laborious as to their Civil Callings in the world, but had ſtood idle all the day as to any ſpiritual work, as to any work of grace; they had not done God, nor their poor ſouls, one ſtroke of work all that while, until they were called, and the light of grace ſhined upon them. Jeſus Chriſt is <hi>the light which lightened
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:48669:70"/> the Gentiles, and the glory of Iſrael</hi> (Luke 2.32.) And whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he comes, <hi>The people which ſat in darkneſs ſee a great light, and to them which ſat in the valley of the ſhadow of death, light ſprings up</hi> (Matth. 4.16.) And that a two-fold light;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Light to be ſaved by.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Light to ſerve God, or to do the work of God by.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, How comfortable is the light! 'Tis ſo comfortable, that light and comfort are often put for the ſame thing. <hi>God is the Lord</hi> (aith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 118.27.) <hi>which hath ſhewed us light;</hi> that is, the light of counſel what to do, and the light of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in what we do, or after all our ſufferings. Light is not only a candle held to us, to do our work by, but it comforts and cheareth us in our work (<hi>Eccl.</hi> 11.7.) <hi>Light is ſweet, and a pleaſant thing it is for the eyes to behold the Sun.</hi> Hence that of <hi>David</hi> (Pſal. 65.8.) <hi>Thou makest the out-goings of the evening and morning to rejoyce;</hi> that is, thou makeſt men to rejoyce, they are glad, they rejoyce in, or at the out-goings of the morning. Man takes comfort at the firſt appearance of the light; light re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſheth him at its out-goings in the morning. And at the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men rejoyce too, for then they go to their reſt, being wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with the labour of the day.<note place="margin">Poſſunt exitus matutini &amp; v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>.</note> Or we may thus expound that Pſalm, <hi>Thou makeſt the out-goings of the morning and the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to rejoyce;</hi> That is, thou makeſt men who live at the out-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the morning, and at the out-goings of the evening to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce. As if it had been ſaid, thou makeſt the Eaſtern people and the Weſtern people, all people from Eaſt to Weſt rejoyce. And that which makes all people to rejoyce, naturally, is the riſing of light with them in the Eaſt, and the coming of light towards them in the Weſt.</p>
                  <p>Thus we ſee what an excellent creature light is, both as it hath a continually renewed riſing in the morning of every day, and as it had its firſt being in the morning of the world, and both from the command of God. Whence take theſe inferences.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, When we behold the morning coming forth by the command of God; Let us conſider who God is, and what the beauty, and purity, the majeſty, and excellency of God are, who is clothed with light, and dwelleth in light, yea, <hi>who is light, and in whom there is no darkneſs at all.</hi> There is not any one creature, which God doth ſo formally predicate of himſelf,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:48669:70"/> as this of light. <hi>As God is love</hi> (1 John 4.8.) <hi>ſo God is light,</hi> (1 <hi>John</hi> 1.5.) yet the light which ſhines to us, the morning, which God hath commanded for us, is but darkneſs to God, who hath commanded it. Light it ſelf is darkneſs, compared with God; yet 'tis the cleareſt ſhadow, the beſt reſemblance of God in Nature.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As we ſhould conſider the excellency and beauty of God in the appearance of the morning, ſo his goodneſs, who hath made ſuch a creature for us, who hath alſo prepared ſo many veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels to hold it and hold it out, or to diſpence it to us. 'Tis God who hath made thoſe great lights, <hi>the Sun to rule the day, and the Moon and Stars to rule the night</hi> (Gen. 1.16.) The day would be night to us, if God had not prepared the Sun (for though there were three days before the Sun was made, yet now 'tis the Sun which makes the day) and the night would be nothing but darkneſs to us, if God had not prepared the Moon and the Stars. How great then is the goodneſs of God to man, who hath made light for us, and who thus conveys and diſpenſeth it to us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our need, both by day, and by night!</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, We ſhould hence be minded to pay our debt of thankfulneſs to God every day. Hiſtory tells us, that the ancient <hi>Rhodians</hi> or inhabitants of the Iſle called <hi>Rhodes,</hi> erected a mighty <hi>Coloſſus</hi> (according to their heatheniſh ſuperſtition) in honour of the Sun, who once a day at leaſt opened his face upon their Iſland, though it were over-caſt with clouds, muffled up, and vailed to all other parts of the world. Though, poſſibly, we do not ſee the face of the Sun every day, yet we enjoy the light and influences of it every day. God hath commanded the Sun in the Firmament to attend us, to be about us, to comfort us, every morning; and ſhall we be unthankful! If in a dark night a friend will but lend us a candle and a lanthorn, we thank him; What matter of thanks to God then ſhould it be, that he hath ſet up thoſe candles, thoſe torches, thoſe lamps of light for our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and guidance continually.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, If God hath commanded the light, ſo excellent a creature to ſerve us, to be for our uſe, then <hi>let us make uſe of the light to ſerve the Lord in and by;</hi> let us make uſe of natural light, that of the Sun in the air; and of ſpiritual light, that of Chriſt the Sun in the Goſpel, moſt of all. Let us make uſe of natural
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:48669:71"/> light, as to civil, and of ſpiritual light, as to holy ends and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments; let no beam of light ſhine to us in vain. It is ſinful, not to make a good uſe of natural light, 'tis very ſinful and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous not to make a good uſe of ſpiritual, 'tis condemnation to refuſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, the light and life of the world, hath counſelled us) <hi>Let our light ſhine</hi> (and ſo ſhine) <hi>before men, that they may ſee our good works, and glorifie our father which is in heaven</hi> (Matth. 5.16) We that have light comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for us every day, how ſhould we be lights, and go forth as the Sun, caſting out our rays and beams, in a holy and godly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation! And while we go forth and walk in ſuch a converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we go forth and walk as the Sun in its ſtrength, we enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en all the world where we come, and dazel the eyes of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed world, or of the wicked in the world.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, How ſhould we, who have light commanded for us, avoid all the works of darkneſs; yea, <hi>We ſhould</hi> (as the Apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.12, 13.) <hi>caſt off the works of darkneſs, and put on the armour of light; we ſhould walk honeſtly, as in the day:</hi> As in the day which the light of the natural Sun makes, and as in the day, which the light of the myſtical Sun, our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, hath made.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, Remember, as God hath commanded a morning for us here, ſo he will command a light, or a morning, a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning light for all our actions hereafter. As God hath made the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:48669:71"/> the light, ſo he will bring all things to light. Many now live in the light of this world, whoſe works are in the dark as well as theirs are works of darkneſs. Now as the Lord hath commanded a morning to ſhine for us to worke by, ſo he will have a morning wherein all our works ſhall be ſeen (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.5.) <hi>He will bring to light the hidden things of darkneſs, and the manifeſt the counſels of the heart.</hi> Men may dig deep, to hide their counſels from God; but God knows how to bring them and their counſels to the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and will cauſe a light to ſhine upon them, though they have no light of truth or righteouſneſs in them. <hi>God will bring every work into judgement with every ſecret thing</hi> (Eccl. 12.14.) <hi>We muſt all appear</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10.) or we muſt all be manifeſt; we muſt appear, and ſo muſt our works too. Thoſe works of men ſhall be light, as to their diſcovery, which are nothing but darkneſs, as to their impurity. Thoſe deeds which have no light in them, ſhall come in the cleareſt light, and be plainly ſeen to the bottom, both by Men and Angels. The Lord who hath commanded this mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ning light for us to do our work in, will command another morning light to judge our works in, and to give us the reward of them. And let all the wicked of the earth, to whom <hi>the morning</hi> of any day (becauſe they are in danger to be diſcovered by it) <hi>is as the ſhadow of death</hi> (Job 24.17.) Let them (I ſay) conſider how many thouſand deaths that morning will be to them, which will actually, fully, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially diſcover all their wickedneſs, with all the ſecrets of it.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Conſider if the Lord hath beſtowed ſo great a mercy upon us, in commanding the morning, or in giving us light, the light of the Sun; then let us be minded, how great a mercy the Lord hath beſtowed upon us in commanding the light or morning of the Goſpel to come upon us. It was night with us, and ſo it would have been for ever, for any means we could have deviſed or uſed to help out ſelves out of it, till God commanded Chriſt, <hi>the bright Morning Star</hi> (Rev. 22.16.) <hi>and Sun of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to riſe and ſhine upon us.</hi> How unſpeakable a mercy is it, that ſuch a light ſhould appear to us, who not only were in darkneſs, but were darkneſs! If we account it a mercy, that God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded a morning to ſhine to us; O what a mercy is it, that we have a Chriſt to ſhine upon us! That the Day-Star from on high
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:48669:72"/> hath viſited us! That he who is the true light, that enlightens e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man that cometh into the world (<hi>John</hi> 1.9.) hath riſen up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, both to ſcatter the darkneſs of ſin and ignorance, and to chear our ſouls with the ſweet beams of his healing wings.</p>

                  <p>That is, when and where it ſhould break forth and appear eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry morning.

When the day-ſpring uſhers in the morning, there is a kind of dimneſs in the light. Now ſaith the Lord, <hi>Haſt thou cauſed the day-ſpring to know its place? haſt thou taught it,</hi> where to ſhew it ſelf to the world? The Lord ſpeaks nere of the <hi>day-ſpring,</hi> as if it were a rational crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that took inſtructions, or a word of direction, where to begin the morning light. God, not man, hath taught the day-ſpring to know its place. We have a like expreſſion (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.11.) <hi>Thou wilt ſhew me</hi> (or <hi>thou wilt cauſe me to know) the path of life.</hi> Thus the Lord makes <hi>the day-ſpring know</hi> the path to its own place. The day never ſprings twice immediately in one place, but is in a continual variation, as Aſtronomers with experience teach. The place of the light or Sun-riſing differeth every morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and from thence we have the difference of the dayes.

                  <p>Hence Note; Firſt,
<q>It is the Lord, who appoints every creature its proper place.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The beauty of the world, is from the order of the world; and that every creature knows its place, makes the whole creation amiable.<note place="margin">

                        </gap>.</note> The World is expreſſed in Greek by a word noting the beauty, and order of it. And that which renders the creatures not onely beautiful but ſerviceable to man, is the order they are placed in. The Sun keeping its appointed courſe, makes Summer at one time, and Winter at another. The Sun ever moves in (unleſs ſtayed by miracle, as in <hi>Joſhua's</hi> time) but never moves out of its place. As no creature is burdenſome, ſo there's no creature unſerviceable, when kept in its place, as was ſurther ſhewed (<hi>verſ.</hi> 10.)</p>
                  <p>Note Secondly,

                  </p>
                  <p>This fettlement was made in the Creation (<hi>Gen.</hi> 1.14.) And
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:48669:73"/> when the flood had made (as it were) a confuſion of the times, and ſeaſons, the Lord renewed this ſettlement (<hi>Gen.</hi> 8.22.) <hi>While the Earth remaineth, ſeed time, and harveſt, and cold, and heat, and Summer and Winter, and day and night ſhall not ceaſe.</hi> Read this fully (<hi>Jer.</hi> 31.35, 36. <hi>Jer.</hi> 33.20.) Sun and Moon know their time, and 'tis God, who hath taught them this knowledge, and given them this inſtruction. The light keeps its time, though it changeth its time every day (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.19.) <hi>He appointeth the Moon for ſeaſons, the Sun knoweth his going down.</hi> The Sun is inſtructed (as it were) where to riſe, and where to go down. The Sun follows the direction of God. There is no rational crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>re that doth ſo exactly follow the conduct of God, as the Sun. The Sun forgets not its duty, it never miſtook the hour either of its riſing or going down (as we more largely ſhewed a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) it never miſtook a hairs breadth for place, nor a moment of its time. And as it moves according to the command of God: ſo nothing can ſtay its motion, but the command of God: And if He ſay, <hi>Sun ſtand thou ſtill,</hi> it will do ſo again, as in the days of <hi>Joſhua.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now if all creatures keep their ſtation, and obſerve their motion according to the inſtructions they receive from God, ſhould not this be our inſtruction? If God hath cauſed the day-ſpring to know its place and time; if the Sun riſe where and when he would have it; Shall not we know our place and time? Shall not we be where and when God would have us? As every thing, ſo every perſon is moſt uſeful in his proper place and ſeaſon. The Sun is therefore ſo uſeful, becauſe it knows and keeps both, carrying and diſtributing its light up and down the world, to the ſons of men, anſwerably to its inſtructions, and that commiſſion given it from above.</p>
                  <p>The Lord having put queſtions to <hi>Job</hi> about the direction of the morning light, and by whom the day-ſpring is taught to know its place; proceeds to ſhew the work and effects of the day-ſpring and morning light. <hi>Haſt thou cauſed the day-ſpring to know its place?</hi>

                     </gap>eads it ſelf the further, by ſo much the worſe it is; ſo good, by how much the more it ſpreads it ſelf, it is the better. As the natural light of the day, ſo the ſpiritual light of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, is very diffuſive. When the Goſpel was firſt preacht by the Apoſtles of Chriſt (the <hi>day-ſpring from on high</hi> then viſiting the world) O how ſpeedily did that take hold of the ends of the earth! <hi>David</hi> (Pſal. 22.27.) ſpeaking of the Prophetical Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Chriſt, in ſending forth the light of his truth, ſaith, <hi>All the ends of the earth ſhall remember and turn to God.</hi> What cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the ends of the earth to remember? and what did they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member? Surely it was the light of the Goſpel, taking hold of the ends of the earth, which cauſed the ends of the earth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member God and themſelves; they ſaw their danger and their duty, and ſo turned to God. By <hi>the ends of the earth</hi> in that place of the Pſalm, we are to underſtand the inhabitants of the utmoſt parts of the earth; who had never remembred themſelves, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver conſidered themſelves, never awakened out of ſin, never turned to God, if the light of the Goſpel had not ſhined to them. The natural light is not onely very extenſive, but powerful; and ſo is the light of the Goſpel, it goes to the ends of the earth with won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:48669:74"/> effects. The Apoſtles had a Commiſſion from Chriſt, like that which God gives to the Sun, to carry their light, or to <hi>preach the Goſpel to every creature.</hi> The Sun gives light and influence to every creature (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.6.) <hi>His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it; and there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hid from the heat thereof:</hi> Nor ſhall any thing be hid from the light, heat, and influences of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,
<q>The light is exceeding ſwift, and ſpreads it ſelf far and near in a moment.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Many can go far, if you give them time; but the light goes very far, even to the ends of the earth (upon the matter) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out time; it goes almoſt in an inſtant, in the twinkling of an eye, it immediately <hi>takes hold of the ends of the earth.</hi> As ſoon as the Sun ariſeth, light appeareth, day breaks, and with an unconcei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable ſpeed illuſtrates all places within its eye, or which lie open to it. The body of the Sun moves faſt, to a wonder, but the beams of the Sun move faſter. <hi>David</hi> (Pſal. 139.9.) ſpeaks of the wings of the morning. <hi>If I take</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the wings of the morning</hi> (that is the morning light) <hi>and fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e to the utmoſt parts of the earth, even there ſhall thy hand lead me, &amp;c.</hi> The morning light is winged, and moves with incredible ſwiftneſs. The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſpeaks of the morning light, with reſpect to its ſudden motion, as if it were a feathered or winged fowl, ſpreading its rayes as ſo many feathers or plumes, over all at an inſtant. Though darkneſs, thick darkneſs, hath got poſſeſſion of the earth in the night, yet no ſooner doth the light glimmer above the Horizon, but darkneſs is ſuddenly ſcattered. One would think there ſhould be a great battel, a long conteſt, between light and darkneſs, before light could conquer darkneſs, and get it off the face of the earth; whereas daily experience teacheth us that the morning having once opened its eye-lids, light gets an eaſie victory, and ſheddeth it ſelf abroad every where without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul. Darkneſs is ſoon diſpelled and driven out of the field by light. Darkneſs cannot ſtand its ground before the Sun, who is <hi>Lord of the day,</hi> according to the appointment of God.</p>
                  <p>Thus the <hi>day-ſpring takes hold of the ends of the earth.</hi> And if any ask, Why doth it ſo?</p>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:48669:75"/>
                  <p>I anſwer, The day-ſpring is a great and a faithful ſervant to man. There are many uſes of light, many ſervices, which the light doth for us; I toucht ſome of them in opening the former Context. We have one eſpecial uſe or ſervice of it expreſſed in the cloſe of this verſe; <hi>It takes hold of the ends of the earth,</hi>
                     <q>That the wicked may be ſhaken out of it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This latter part of the verſe ſeems to have little cognation with, and to be of a very difficult connexion with the former; for it may be ſaid, What hath this <hi>ſhaking of the wicked out of the earth to do with the light taking hold of the ends of the earth?</hi> I anſwer, The light that takes hold of the ends of the earth, is as a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant to arreſt and take hold of the wicked, and ſo is a means to ſhake them out of the earth. The words may carry a double Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor,</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Lux orat terrae tanquam pall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </note>Firſt, To the ſhaking of a garment. When duſt or moths, or any thing hurtful to a garment, is found upon it, we ſhake it out. Thus the Lord ſends forth the morning light, to take hold of the ends of the earth, as of the ends of a great garment, that the wicked, who are but as duſt and vermin, may be ſhaken out of it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The metaphor or alluſion may be taken from a ſieve. As the ſieve is ſhaken when we would ſeparate the chaffe, or that which is vile and worthleſs from among the good corn; ſo the Lord by the light takes hold of the ends of the earth, and ſhakes the wicked like droſs or darnel, out of the company of honeſt men. <hi>I,</hi> ſaith the Lord (<hi>Amos</hi> 9.9.) <hi>will ſift the houſe of Iſrael among all Nations, like as corn is ſifted in a ſieve; yet ſhall not the leaſt grain fall upon the earth, that is, be loſt or periſh.</hi> But the wicked, who are as chaffe, ſhall be ſcattered, and periſh for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, when the Lord ſifts them.</p>
                  <p>Again, Theſe words, <hi>That the wicked may be ſhaken out of it,</hi> are by ſome expounded actively; <hi>The day-ſpring taketh hold of the ends of the earth, that the wicked may ſhake (ſc.</hi> themſelves) <hi>out of it.</hi> For when the light cometh, wicked men do, as it were, ſhake themſelves out of the earth; that is, they hide themſelves, and run their heads into a corner. They who in the night and darkneſs go abroad doing miſchief, following wicked purpoſes,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:48669:75"/> when the light appears, diſ-appear, with-draw, and play (as we ſay) leaſt in ſight (<hi>Job</hi> 24.13.) <hi>The wicked are they that rebel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the light,</hi> they hate it, cannot endure it, they are like the wild beaſts of the earth, that raven in the night, but in the day couch in their dens and coverts, no man can tell where to find them (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.20, 21, 22.) <hi>Thou makeſt darkneſs, and it is night, wherein all the beaſts of the forreſt do creep forth, &amp;c. The Sun ariſeth, they gather themſelves together, and lay them down in their dens.</hi> Thus the wild beaſts are ſhaken out of the earth, when the light appears, and ſo are wicked beaſt-like men (<hi>John</hi> 3.20.) <hi>Every one that doth evil, hateth the light.</hi> And as ſuch hate the ſpiritual light of the Goſpel, ſo they do not very well like the natural light of the day. Wicked men decline the light, and are called darkneſs, and their works are called the works of darkneſs; and therefore when the Sun ariſeth, theeves, robbers, and all of thoſe wicked trades, may be ſaid to ſhake themſelves out of the earth. He that doth evil, hates the light, he looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on light as an enemy.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Theſe words,<note place="margin">Mane judicia exercebantur. <hi>Druſ. Grot.</hi> Senſus horum verborum è, ut improbi die ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orto trahantur ad judicia, ac ita terra excuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antur. <hi>Piſc.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>That the wicked might be ſhaken out of it,</hi> are rather to be underſtood of the wicked, as often ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in the morning, for evil done in the night. When the day-ſpring appears, it diſcovers wicked men, who being taken, examined, and tried, are by the Sentence of the Judge and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of the Magiſtrate, ſhaken out of the earth. God the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Judge, ſeems to ſearch the whole earth by the Candle of the Sun, as he once threatned to ſearch <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with candles.</p>
                  <p>Hence Note, Firſt;
<q>Light is a diſcoverer.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Light makes all things manifeſt. As the light of the Word diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers the evil that is in the works of wicked men, and makes that manifeſt; ſo the light of the Sun diſcovers the perſons of wicked men, and makes them manifeſt. We cannot diſtinguiſh white from black, nor can we ſee where men are, nor what they are doing, till light be-friend us. And as the natural light makes things manifeſt, ſo much more doth ſpiritual light, the light of Law and Goſpel. By the power of that light wicked men are ſhaken and driven out of their ſins; by that light they
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:48669:76"/> ſee, judge, and condemn themſelves. And thus the wicked are indeed ſhaken out of the earth, that is, out of their earthly ſtate of ſin and unbelief.</p>

And as they who are light, ought not to have any complying communion with darkneſs; ſo they who are darkneſs, cannot have or hold any pleaſing communion with light.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If we take theſe words as holding out one main de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the Providence of God, in ſending the light every morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; namely, <hi>that the wicked may be ſhaken out of the earth.</hi> This ſhews that wicked men ſhould be ſpeedily proceeded with, and the earth unburdened of them. The ordinary uſe of the light is, that men may go forth to their labour (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.23.) Now, as that is one great uſe of light, that man may ſee his honeſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and be guided to, or in the works of his calling; ſo ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther great uſe of it is, to apprehend wicked men, who do diſhoneſt work, and bring them to judgement. <hi>David</hi> ſaid (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 101.8.) <hi>I will early, or, in the morning, deſtroy all the wicked of the land:</hi> As ſoon as ever the light takes hold of the ends of the earth, if I can, I will take hold of evil doers; that is, I will not delay, much leſs, ſtop the courſe of juſtice againſt them that do wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly. This was a kingly reſolve, <hi>Early will I deſtroy the wicked of the land.</hi> This was the Prophets counſel (<hi>Jer.</hi> 21.3.) <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute judgement in the morning,</hi> that is, with the firſt opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. It is not good to be raſh in judgement, nor is it to be ſlack in judgement. Wicked men are a burden to the earth, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis fit with the firſt (when there is no other remedy) to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burden the earth of them.</p>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:48669:76"/>
                  <p>There is yet another reading and expoſition of this latter part of the verſe, taking the word rendred <hi>wicked,</hi> not for perſons,<note place="margin">Bolduc.</note> but for things, and then 'tis read in the Neuter gender, <hi>The light takes hold of the ends of the earth, to ſhake wicked or evil things (that is, thoſe things which are noxious to the earth) out of it.</hi> The heat of the Sun riſing upon the earth, exhales and draws out hurtful vapours from the earth, which, abiding in the bowels of it, would hinder its fruit-bearing, or make it barren. This ſenſe is proſecuted all along by ſome Interpreters, quite thorow the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſes, but I ſhall not ſtay upon it.</p>
                  <p>The Lord having ſhewed this uſe of the light which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands every morning, ſhews (in the next verſe) ſome other uſes or effects of it.</p>

                  <p>That is, The approach of light makes a great change upon the

A piece of clay is a rude lump, without form or figure; but if you take a ſeal and ſtamp it, that clay readily receives any figure or coat of arms engraven on the ſeal; and ſo 'tis turned from what it was in appearance. Thus the meaning ſeems to be this: The earth before the Sun riſeth, is like a rude piece of clay (in the night we ſee no more beauty in the earth, than if it had no beauty at all; go to a well compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed garden, walk there in a dark night, you cannot diſcern the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of any border, nor the rareſt beauty of any flower, nor the pleaſanteſt fruit of any tree planted there, your eye cannot take in nor feaſt it ſelf upon any of thoſe delights, while dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs covers the face of the earth) but when the light comes,<note place="margin">Terra ad Solis ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This is moſt true of ſpiritual light; when that ariſeth upon any place or people, that place or people are turned as clay to the ſeal, onely with this difference, the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral light of the Sun doth only manifeſt what figures or ſtamps are already impreſſed upon the earth, it doth not make any there, which were not there before; but where the Sun-ſhine of the Goſpel comes, though it were a place as rude as Barbariſme it ſelf, 'tis turned into another ſhape, the people are quite another people in their manners and converſation. It was ſo with this Nation, we were once as rude heathens as any in the world; but by the light of the Goſpel we were turned as clay to the ſeal; we received the figure of Grace, the figure of Chriſtianity.

The earth is, not onely as a thing without form, but as a naked thing, as a body without clothing to appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, till the light appears; but as ſoon as the light appears, then whatſoever may be called the earths clothing, and apparel, appears <hi>alſo.</hi>

                  <p>There is yet another expoſition of this 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe, <hi>They ſtand as a garment,</hi> that is, the wicked ſpoken of in the latter end of the former verſe, and are there ſaid, <hi>to be ſhaken out of the earth;</hi> who are alſo ſpoken of, in the following verſe, where it is ſaid, <hi>Their light is with-holden, and their high arm ſhall be broken.</hi> Theſe wicked ones, when the light ſhines, <hi>are made to ſtand forth, as in a garment;</hi> That is (ſaith one Author, noted in the Margin) the wicked are then with-held from going on in their wickedneſs, or from proſecuting and promoting their evil deſigns and pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Both theſe Interpretations correſpond clearly with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text, both before and after; the Lord giving this as a ſpecial ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, that the day-ſpring or light doth to mankind, the diſcovery and deſtruction of evil men; as will be ſeen more fully, in open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the next verſe.</p>

                  <p>It was ſhewed before, that this 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe ſeems to be an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the latter part of the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe. There it was ſaid, The light <hi>takes hold of the ends of the earth, that the wicked might be ſhaken out of it;</hi> here it followeth, <hi>From the wicked, their light is with-holden;</hi> that is, wicked men, when the light hath diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered

                  <p>Thirdly, The light of their life, or their life ſhall be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden from them; that is, they ſhall be put to death for their wickedneſs.</p>
                  <p>All theſe may be called their light, becauſe they ſometime enjoyed them; and their light in all or any of theſe notions, is ſaid to be with-holden from them, not as if they had a right to hold it longer, but becauſe they would fain have held it longer, if they might. Thus, <hi>from the wicked their light is with-holden;</hi> as if it had been ſaid, they are totally and finally deprived of all their good.</p>
                  <p>Now, whereas light in the ſenſe opened, is called <hi>their light,</hi> that is, the light of the wicked;</p>
                  <p>Note;
<q>Even the wicked have a title to light, or to good things.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>God gives light or good things to the evil as well as to the good (<hi>Mat.</hi> 5.45.) <hi>He maketh his Sun to riſe on the evil and on the good;</hi> even they who are evil and are daily doing evil, enjoy the light of the Sun, and the light of all outward good things, thorow the patience and goodneſs of God. Much more may the godly when they ſee the light or good of this world, look upon it as theirs, as a part of their inheritance here below. As hereafter all the godly ſhall have an inheritance among the Saints in light, ſo many of them have an inheritance of light here, the Sun is a piece of their portion. God having adopted them to be his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, the Sun is a debtor to them, and they may reckon it among their good things, though not as their good; God having provided better things for them than the light of this world, or of any good

<q>Wicked men forfeit, and ſo are deprived of the good things which God gives to them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The wicked cannot long, ſhall not alwayes enjoy the good things of this world. When wicked men abuſe the light, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when they reſiſt the light of nature ſhining into their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, and refuſe the light of the Goſpel ſhining in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and Ordinances, and reſolve to walk on in the darkneſs of their minds, then from them that light of comfort and proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is with-holden; yea, they are often thruſt out of the light of the Sun, and out of the light of this preſent life, into that inner darkneſs of the grave, and into that <hi>outer darkneſs</hi> of hell (<hi>Matth.</hi> 25.30.) that is, into a darkneſs furtheſt remote, or at greateſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from light, even out of the reach of light. Doth God ſay to his own people when they ſin (<hi>Jer.</hi> 5.25.) <hi>Your ſins have with-holden good things from you?</hi> Much more then ſhall the light and all good things, or all the good things of light be with hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den from the wicked, whoſe whole trade and buſineſs lies in works of darkneſs, or in ſinning againſt God. 'Tis bad with man, when God with-holds natural light, the light of the Sun, the good things of this world from him; but 'tis infinitely worſe with man, when God with-holds the light of the Goſpel, and the light of his countenance, any ſpiritual light or good from him, and ſhuts any up in the contrary darkneſs. <hi>From the wicked light is with-holden,</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Strength</hi> is often expreſt in Scripture by the arm; read <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.15. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.17. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 30.22. And a high arm notes
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:48669:79"/> great ſtrength. The Lord is ſaid to do his great things with a <hi>ſtretched out (or a high arm.)</hi> Mans arm may here be called an <hi>high arm,</hi> becauſe the arm of man uſeth to be lifted up on high to ſtrike hard and home. The higher the arm is lifted up, the heavier it falls, and the deeper impreſſion it makes. To ſin with a high hand, is in Scripture language to ſin preſumptuouſly and audaciouſly. They ſin with a high hand, who ſin againſt light, or in the face of counſel and reproof. And as they ſin mightily, or with all their might, who ſin with a high hand; ſo they act mightily, or with all their might, they lay on load (as we ſay) who reſolving to do any thing, have a high arm to do it wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Now when any act evil to the height, with heat and boldneſs, God will take a courſe with them; as it followeth in the cloſe of the verſe, <hi>The high arm,</hi> that is, ſuch <hi>a high arm</hi>
                     <q>Shall be broken.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis an alluſion to the puniſhing of malefactors,<note place="margin">Damnabitur ad mortem &amp; qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem cruciabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, qualis eſt in rota fractio. <hi>Grot.</hi>
                     </note> by breaking their bodies or bones upon a wheel. To be broken, is to be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly ſpoiled. A broken heart is a great mercy (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.17.) but a broken arm notes a great miſery.</p>
                  <p>This Scripture threatens <hi>the high arm with breaking,</hi> yet it leaves us unreſolved, or faith nothing expreſly, about theſe three Queries:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Whoſe high arm is here threatned with breaking?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, By whom the high arm ſhall be broken?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, How or by what means, or in what manner it ſhall be broken?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer to the firſt, Theſe terrible words are not levell'd nor intended againſt any high arm <hi>(eo nomine)</hi> upon that account, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is high. God is not angry with the highneſs of men. They who are higheſt, and have the higheſt arm among men, may be highly pleaſing unto God. The higheſt powers on earth, are of Gods ordaining and appointing; now, God cannot be againſt his own ordinances and appointments; therefore he never b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eaks the high arm, becauſe 'tis high in power, but becauſe 'tis high in wickedneſs. So then we may be confident, 'tis only the high
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:48669:80"/> arm of the wicked which is here threatned to be broken.</p>
                  <p>To the ſecond and third Queries, I anſwer in a word; It is God who breaks the high arm, and he breaks it in what manner, and by what means ſoever pleaſeth him.</p>
                  <p>In which we may ſee a ſignal work of divine Providence, which doth not ſuffer the difference of good and evil, of right and wrong, to paſs long unobſerved. And in this paſſage poſſibly, the Lord might intend a refutation of what <hi>Job</hi> ſaid (<hi>Chap.</hi> 10.3.) That <hi>God ſhined upon the Counſels of the wicked:</hi> For ſeeing the very light or life of the wicked is with-holden from them, and their high arm broken, doth not God declare and teſtifie that he loveth righteouſneſs, and hateth iniquity? And if the miniſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Divine Juſtice lye in the dark at any time, doth not the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of the light every day intimate, that a day of the revelation of the righteous Judgment of God is at hand? <hi>The high arm ſhall be broken.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence Note, Firſt;
<q>Wicked men may grow high, and have a very high and ſtrong arm.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore be not ſcandalized when 'tis ſo. The moſt high God often ſuffers it to be ſo. The wicked man in the Text is he that hath the high arm.</p>

                  <p>A learned Interpreter takes notice, that in the larger Bibles, and moſt correct Copies, the Hebrew Word ſignifying <hi>the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> both in this 15th verſe, and in the 13th verſe, hath one
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:48669:80"/> letter raiſed up higher than the reſt, and exceeding the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry form of writing; as may be ſeen, if the Reader pleaſe to caſt his eye upon the quotation in the Margin. This (ſaith my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor) is not (poſſibly) without a miſtery; even to intimate thus much, that all the proſperity and outward ſplendor of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hangs in ſuſpence, or is very tottering and unſtable. But whatever occaſioned that irregularity in the Hebrew writing, or whatever it may import, this is a ſure truth, that the higheſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of the wicked is very unſure.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Lord</hi> (who as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 5.8) <hi>is higher than the higheſt</hi> (on earth) can quickly bring down the higheſt, and break or cruſh the ſtrong arm, as one would break a reed, or cruſh a moth. Thus the Lord beſpake <hi>Edom</hi> by his Prophet (<hi>Jer.</hi> 49.16.) <hi>O thou that dwelleſt in the clifts of the rock, that holdeſt the height of the hill; though thou ſhouldeſt make thy neſt as high as the Eagle, I will bring thee down from thence, ſaith the Lord.</hi> And thus the Lord ſpake by another Prophet concerning the <hi>Amorite, (Amos</hi> 2.9.) <hi>His height was like the height of the Cedars, and he was ſtrong as the Oaks; yet I deſtroyed his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath;</hi> that is, I utterly deſtroyed him. Yea, the very being of the wicked high and ſtrong, is an argument that they ſhall be brought low, deſtroyed, and broken to pieces. When <hi>Babylons</hi> arm ſhall be in its higheſt height, <hi>When ſhe ſhall ſay in her heart, I ſit as a Queen</hi> (that is, on high) <hi>and am no Widdow, and ſhall ſee no ſorrow.</hi> When <hi>Babylon</hi> is thus prophecy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all good of her ſelf, and promiſing all good to her ſelf, <hi>then ſhall her plague come in one day, death and famine, and mourning, and ſhe ſhall be utterly burnt with fire; for ſtrong is the Lord, who judgeth her</hi> (Rev. 18.7, 8.) He will break her high arm, and break it when ſhe thinks it higheſt, and her ſelf ſafeſt. <hi>David</hi> whoſe arm God raiſed on high, affirmed all this of wicked high ones in general, or of all thoſe, who ſhould be found high in wickedneſs (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 92.7, 8.) <hi>When the wicked ſpring as graſs, and when all the workers of iniquity do flouriſh, it is that they ſhall be deſtroyed for ever.</hi> As if he had ſaid, that's the meaning of their proſperity, you may ſpell that our of it, or make that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of it, <hi>they ſhall be deſtroyed for ever.</hi> As the Lord <hi>remembers his people in their low eſtate, becauſe his mercy endureth for ever</hi> (Pſal. 136.23.) ſo he will take vengeance on the wicked
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:48669:81"/> in their high eſtate, <hi>becauſe his juſtice endureth for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The leaſt ſin deſerves a breaking; but when the arm of ſin is grown very high, we may ſay the Lords arm cannot hold, he muſt break ſuch high arms. The Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> (chap. 6.6.) ſpeaking of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſaith, <hi>This City is to be viſited;</hi> how viſited? There is a twofold viſiting:</p>

                  <p>Secondly, In wrath and judgement.</p>
                  <p>Uſually when the Scripture ſpeaks of viſiting a City or a Land, it is meant in wrath and in judgement. <hi>Shall I not viſit for theſe things, ſaith the Lord?</hi> (Jer. 5.9.) Surely I ſhall, there is no avoiding my viſitation. What kind of viſitation is meant, the next wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But why was the City <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to be viſited in wrath? there's no City whoſe inhabitants are ſo juſt and righteous, but the Lord may viſit them in wrath; but of this City the Lord ſaid, <hi>it is wholly oppreſſion;</hi> they are given up to oppreſſion, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one is oppreſſing and wronging his brother; now when they ſinned at this rate, when their arm was thus high in wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, then it was to be broken. There is a righteous God that judgeth the earth; and therefore the high arm of unrighteouneſs ſhall be broken.</p>

                  <p>Hence Note, Firſt;
<q>There are ſecrets or depths in the ſea, beyond mens ſearching or finding out.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſea in many parts of it may be ſearched. Some have been at the bottom of it, many have let down a line to the bottom of it; yet it is uſual in Scripture to ſpeak of the ſea as a thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable, or ſo deep, that none can find the depth of it. The ſea is ſo deep, that it is ſometimes called <hi>the depth</hi> (chap. 28.1.) <hi>The depth ſaith</hi> (that is, the Sea ſaith) <hi>it</hi> (that is, wiſdom) <hi>is not in me.</hi> 'Tis alſo called <hi>the deep</hi> (Luke 5.4. <hi>chap.</hi> 8.31.) That is very deep, which is called <hi>the deep;</hi> and that's of an unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able depth, which is called <hi>the depth.</hi> Such a depth, ſo deep is the ſea, that no man knows how deep, or what the depth of it is?</p>
                  <p>Now, if we cannot reach the depth of the natural ſea, then (which is the ſcope of this place) ſurely there are depths and ſecrets in the ways and counſels of God, which no man can earch or find out. <hi>David</hi> (Pſal. 139.9.) ſpeaking of the Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo preſence of God, ſaith, <hi>Whither ſhall I go from thy preſence? If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermoſt parts of the ſea; there ſhall thy hand find me.</hi> There is no depth, no breadth, but God can find it out; but how little of the depth or breadth of God can we find out! (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.6.) <hi>Thy judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are a great deep;</hi> that is, thou O Lord doſt terrible things in judgement as angry, yet ſuch righteous things, as juſt and wiſe, that 'tis very hard for any, and impoſſible for <hi>the many,</hi> or moſt
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:48669:83"/> of men to ſee the reaſon of them. And doubtleſs, it was the deep of his own divine judgements that God intended to lead <hi>Job</hi> to, when he ſpake here of the depth of the Sea. We read what the Apoſtle was forced to, when he was but, as it were, dipping his feet into this ſea of the Counſels and Judgements of God, even to cry out, <hi>O the depth</hi> (Rom. 11.33.) As if he had ſaid, I dare not enter into the ſprings of this ſea, nor into the ſearch of this depth. <hi>O the depth of the riches both of the wiſdom and knowledge of God! how unſearchable are his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and his ways paſt finding out!</hi> This was <hi>Davids</hi> expreſs Confeſſion concerning the providential way of God, <hi>His way is in the ſea, and his path in the great waters, and his footſteps are not known</hi> (Pſal. 77.19.) Goings upon the water leave no print behind them, we cannot obſerve a track in the ſea. God walks ſometimes as upon the land, we may eaſily diſcern his footſteps, and ſee whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e he hath gone: But he often walks as upon the ſea, where no man can ſee his paths, nor are his footſteps known. <hi>The Lord is known by the judgement which he executeth</hi> (Pſal. 9.16.<note place="margin">Profunditas maris rei ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcuriſſimae &amp; ignotiſſimae hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manae intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentiae ſoli deo perſpectae ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolum.</note>) yet his judgements are ſeldome known, they are a great deep, a ſea. The ſea is a clear emblem of all obſcure and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known things, eſpecially of thoſe ways of God which are too deep for our diſcovery, and lie beyond the reach of our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. And indeed, as ſoon may we hold the ſea in the hollow of our hand, or lade it dry with a Cockle-ſhell, as comprehend the deep counſels of God, and the myſteries of providence, by which they are acted and effected in our ſhallow underſtanding. Onely what we cannot attain, either by ſenſe or reaſon, we may <hi>underſtand by faith,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith, We do that <hi>the worlds were</hi> made by the Word of God (<hi>Heb.</hi> 11.3.) Who is able, any other way than by believing, to enter into thoſe ſprings, or walk in the ſearch of thoſe depths?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Learn this from it;
<q>There is nothing a ſecret unto God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>That which here is denied to <hi>Job,</hi> is to be affirmed of God. <hi>Job</hi> knew not thoſe ſecrets, but God knew them. <hi>Job</hi> himſelf ſaid (<hi>chap.</hi> 9.8.) <hi>God treadeth upon the waves</hi> (or as the Hebrew is, <hi>the heights) of the ſea.</hi> Here the Lord intimateth that he walketh in the depth of the ſea: Both ſet forth his glory. God
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:48669:84"/> commands from top to bottom, he treads upon the waves aloft; he walks in the depths below, nothing can eſcape either his Power or his Eye. It is the ſole priviledge of God to walk in the ſearch of the ſea, that is, to find out and plainly to diſcern the moſt ſecret things. And by him the moſt unſearchable depths are ſearched out, or rather, are known to him without ſearch. He knoweth even the depth of mans heart, which is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt depth in the world, next to the depth of his own heart. God enters into the ſprings of that ſea, the Sea of mans heart, and walketh in the ſearch of that depth. There are innumerable ſprings in the heart of man, which bubble up, and ſend forth their ſtreams of good or evil continually; all which the Lord ſees more plainly than we ſee any thing that is done above ground, or in the open light. <hi>Moſes</hi> doth not onely report (<hi>Gen.</hi> 6.5.) <hi>That God ſaw the wickedneſs of man was great in the earth</hi> (that is, that his outward practiſes o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>that he ſaw every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was onely evil continually.</hi> Conſider, God ſaw not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the thoughts of man, but every imagination (which is the leaſt thing imaginable) of mans thoughts. He ſaw (as the word which we render imigination properly ſignifies) every figment, every little creature which the thoughts of mans heart was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to frame; and O how many, how exceeding many, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable, are they! yet God ſaw not onely ſome, or many, but every one of them.

                  <p>Thirdly, From the ſcope of this place, note;
<q>That ſeeing we cannot ſearch into the depth of the ſea, it ſhould ſtay our curioſity in ſearching into, and ſtay us from diſcontent, when we cannot find the depth of Gods Counſels concerning us, and of his Providences towards us.</q>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:48669:84"/>
                  <p>There is a dutiful ſearch into the Works of God. <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks of it (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 111.2.) <hi>The works of the Lord are great, ſought out of all thoſe that have pleaſure in them.</hi> They are <hi>ſought out;</hi> that is, they who have pleaſure in them, do and will endeavour ſoberly to ſearch them out; as much as may be; but let all take heed of ſearching them wantonly or preſumptuouſly, that is, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſatisfie their curioſity, or with an opinion that they can reach the depth of them. The Lord would have us ſatisfie our ſelves in the ignorance, or rather neſcience of thoſe natural things which he hath not made known to us. Surely then (which is, as hath been ſaid, the ſcope of this Chapter) we ſhould be ſatisfied, though we in ſome caſes know not, nor can perceive the reaſon of Gods providential dealings, either towa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Will any wiſe or ſober man vex and diſquiet himſelf, will he be angry and pettiſh, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he knows not all the ſecrets of the ear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>h and ſea? (as ſome ſay <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> the Philoſopher was to death and drowning, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he could not find out the reaſon why the ſea in one place ebbed and ſlowed ſeven times in one day) Why then ſhould we be impatient, becauſe the reaſon of Gods proceedings with the ſons of men, or of the ſtrange ebbings and ſlowings of things in the ſea of this world, is ſecreted and hidden f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>om us. And therefore when we are not able to enter into the ſprings of this ſea, nor to walk in the ſearch of this depth, let it not trouble us, but humble us, as it did <hi>Job,</hi> to whom the Lord put theſe queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and proceeded to put more and more hard queſtions, if harder can be, in the next words.</p>
                  <q>
                     <bibl>
                        <hi>Verſ. 17.</hi>
                     </bibl> Have the gates of death been opened (or revealed) unto thee? Or haſt thou ſeen the doors of the ſhadow of death?</q>
                  <p>Here is another ſtrange queſtion. Who among the living hath had the gates of death opened to him? O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> hath viewed the doors of the ſhadow of death?</p>
                  <p>We read often in Scripture of <hi>the gates of death.</hi> (Pſal. 9.13.<note place="margin">Num illius pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>funda, quae verè dixirim mortis regiam, &amp;c. rimatus es. <hi>Bez.</hi>
                     </note> Pſal. 107.18.) and which is all one, of <hi>the gates of the grave, (Iſa.</hi> 38.10.) but who knows what theſe gates are? yet we may ſay ſomething towards the clearing of this queſtion. A gate in ſtrict ſenſe, is that by which we are admitted into any place: and ſo, the gates of death are,</p>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:48669:85"/>
                  <p>That, whatſoever it is, by which we enter into death, or go into the black hall of the grave.</p>
                  <p>Again, The gates of death are any great and eminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Then we may be ſaid to be at the gates of death, when our lives are in great hazard to be loſt, either by the violence of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, or by any violent ſickneſs.</p>
                  <p>In the former ſenſe <hi>David</hi> ſpake (in way of ſupplication, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.13.) <hi>Have mercy on me, O Lord, conſider my trouble, which I ſuffer of them that hate me, thou that lifteſt me up from the gates of death;</hi> that is, from deadly danger. In the latter he ſpake by way of narration, in his elegant deſcription of the ſick, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 107.18.) <hi>Their ſoul abhorreth all manner of meat, and they draw near unto the gates of death;</hi> that is, they are ready to die, or ſick unto death. And thus ſaid King <hi>Hezekiah</hi> upon his <hi>ſick-bed,</hi> and as he thought (a little before) upon his <hi>death-bed, (Iſa.</hi> 38.10.) <hi>I ſhall go to the gates of the grave, I am deprived of the reſidue of my years;</hi> that is, of thoſe years which I might have reckoned upon as mine, according to the common account of mans life, or the uſual courſe of nature.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the more general gates of death, and about theſe all agree.</p>
                  <p>But there are ſeveral opinions, what ſhould be ſpecially in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the <hi>gates of death</hi> in this place.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Portae mortis ſunt cauſae cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptionis, quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum advirtutes corporum <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </note>Firſt, One riſeth very high, ſaying, that by the <hi>gates of death</hi> we are to underſtand the viſible heavens; becauſe the heavenly bodies ſend down ſometimes malignant influences, which have a mighty power to corrupt the bodies of men here below, ſo cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing death to carry them away. Thus he imagins death iſſuing out of the clouds, as out of opened gates, upon men on earth; But that's a far fetcht interpretation.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Purgatory,</hi> the place where the ſouls of all that die not in mortal ſin (as they diſtinguiſh) are reſerved to be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:48669:85"/> by temporary puniſhments, before they can get to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The loweſt of all, is that which we call Hell, the place of the damned, whither all go (ſay they, and we too) who die in ſin without repentance. This place of torment, ſome take for <hi>the gates of death.</hi> But ſeeing the Lord is here ſpeaking of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural things, not of moral actions, not of the conſequents of them, rewards and puniſhments; therefore (though we may truly call Hell the gates or power of death, yet) that notion as well as the former is altogether heterogeneal in this Text.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Several expound <hi>the gates of death,</hi> in connection with the former verſe, for the depth or bottom of the ſea, where many dead carcaſes lie rotting; all ſuch as are caſt away by ſhipwracks, or die at ſea, being uſually thrown into the deep; and therefore at laſt the ſea ſhall give up her dead, as well as the earth.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>The gates of death</hi> ſignifie ſay others, nothing elſe but the grave, or thoſe lower parts of the earth, in which mens bodies deceaſed are buried and laid up to reſt till the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

According to this ſenſe it is as if the Lord had ſaid, <hi>Haſt thou ſeen the ſtate of the dead, or how it fares with them that are gone to their graves? Haſt thou viſited the courts and palaces of the King of terrors?</hi> Thus the gates of death are the gates of the dead.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, We may underſtand by <hi>the gates of death</hi> in general,<note place="margin">An noſti quae fiunt in viſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus terrae. <hi>Vatabl.</hi>

<q>Bodyly death hath gates and doors, paſſages and entrances into it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Deadly ſickneſſes and extream dangers are (as was ſhewed in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening the words) thoſe gates and doors. Many have been brought to thoſe gates, and have been ſtepping into thoſe ſhadows, who yet have been recalled and brought back again, as <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Hezekiah</hi> were, and as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was, who had the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death in himſelf, yet was delivered, truſting in him who raiſeth the dead (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.9, 10.)</p>
                  <p>And therefore in all ſuch caſes, whenever we are brought to the <hi>gates of death, and to the doors of the ſhadow of death,</hi> let us have recourſe to <hi>the living God;</hi> to that God, to <hi>whom belong the iſſues from death</hi> (Pſal. 68.20.) <hi>He that is our God, is the God of ſalvation,</hi> of eternal ſalvation, and of temporal ſalvation, of ſalvation from death by ſickneſs, and of ſalvation from death by danger and trouble: our God is the God of ſalvation, to him belong the iſſues from death. As God openeth the gates of death to let man in, ſo he can open the gates of death to let man out. As there is a gate to go in unto, ſo there is a gate to go out from, or <hi>an out-gate</hi> from death. As the ways to, ſo the iſſues from death belong to God. <hi>Davids</hi> heart was full of this, when having ſaid (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 141.7.) <hi>Our bones are ſcattered at the graves mouth, as when one cutteth and cleaveth wood upon the earth;</hi> that is, we are ready to be cut in pieces and periſh by our enemies (having (I ſay) ſaid this, he preſently adds, <hi>verſ.</hi> 8, 9.) <hi>But mine eyes are

The keys are an emblem of power and authority. Stewards have the keys. He that hath the keys of death, can deliver from death.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Taking death properly, note;
<q>No living man knoweth how or in what way he ſhall die.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The gates of death are not revealed to any man; he hath no certainty by what means he ſhall paſſe out of this world to the grave; he cannot tell through what gate he ſhall go, whether through the gate of a natural death, or of a violent death, as Chriſt ſpake to <hi>Peter (John</hi> 21.18.) <hi>When thou waſt young, thou girdeſt thy ſelf, and wenteſt whether thou wouldeſt; but when thou ſhalt be old, another ſhall gird thee, and carry thee whether thou wouldſt not: this ſpake he, ſignifying by what death he ſhould glorifie God. Peter</hi> did not know what death he ſhould die, whether a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural or a violent death, till Chriſt ſignified it to him. And if man knoweth not at what kind of gate he ſhall enter the houſe of death, that is, whether by ſickneſs or violence, then much leſs doth he know the particular ſickneſſe or violence, by which, as a gate, he muſt paſs into the houſe of death; theſe things the Lord keeps in his own hand. And ſeeing we know not theſe gates of death, we ſhould alwayes pray that we may know the path of life (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.11.) <hi>Thou wilt ſhew me the path of life,</hi> was <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> aſſurance as a type of Chriſt. And though Chriſt ſhould not ſhew any man the gate of his own temporal death, yet he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth every godly man the path of eternal life, and that's enough for us.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Note;
<q>God onely knoweth when, how, and in what way we ſhall die, as alſo what the ſtate and condition of the dead is.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Death is the darkeſt and obſcureſt thing in the world. The grave is a gloomy place, and filled not only with natural but me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorical darkneſs: yet all is light to God, he knows the gates
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:48669:87"/> of death, and the ſtate of the dead (<hi>Prov.</hi> 15.11.) <hi>The grave and deſtruction are before the Lord; how much more the hearts of the children of men!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Taking <hi>the gates of death</hi> generally, for any ſecret or hidden thing,</p>
                  <p>Note;
<q>Man knoweth no more than God revealeth to him.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>When God puts the queſtion, <hi>Have the gates of death been opened or revealed to thee?</hi> it is as if he had ſaid, thou canſt not know them unleſs they are opened to thee. And who can open them, if I my ſelf do not? As all the myſteries of the Goſpel are hidden from us, till God is pleaſed to reveal them; ſo in nature there are many things which are myſteries and ſecrets to us, till God makes them known to us. And there are ſome things which God will no more open to us, than he hath the gates of death, or the doors of the ſhadow of death. And if ſo, then, as God will never blame us for not knowing thoſe things which he hath hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, ſo we ſhould not buſie our ſelves with any enquiries about hidden things. <hi>Though the ſecret of the Lord be with thoſe that fear him</hi> (Pſal. 25.14.) yet they that fear him, will not, dare not meddle with, nor ſearch into the Lords ſecret. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Obſerve;
<q>Whatſoever God is not pleaſed to reveal to us, or is pleaſed to hide from us, that we ſhould be content not to know, and be ſatisfied that it is hidden from us.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>(<hi>Deut.</hi> 29.29.) <hi>The ſecret things belong unto the Lord our God; but thoſe things which are revealed, belong unto us and our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren for ever.</hi> It is both our duty and our intereſt, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with our own ſhare, or to be ſatisfied with what belongs to us, and not to invade Gods peculiars or reſerves. It was <hi>Jobs</hi> fault, he would be entring into the ſecrets of God, but ſaith God, <hi>Have the gates of death been opened unto thee, or haſt thou ſeen the doors of the ſhadow of death?</hi> if not, then be not troubled that thoſe things are not opened to thee, which I have reſerved to my ſelf. God hath not ſtraitned us in any needful point of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, there is enough opened to us, though the gates of death
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:48669:87"/> be not. Is it not enough for us, that in the glaſs of the Goſpel, God hath ſet before us, the myſteries of eternal ſalvation, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he alſo acquaint us in the day of our trial (which was <hi>Jobs</hi> caſe) with all the whole myſtery of his temporal diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?</p>
                  <p>The Lord having urged <hi>Job</hi> with theſe hard queſtions about the depth of the Sea and the gates of death, ſeems now to offer him a more eaſie queſtion in the next verſe.</p>

                  <p>Hence Note, Firſt;
<q>The earth is a huge vaſt body.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>That is very big, whoſe bigneſs is not eaſily perceived, if at all perceivable; and ſuch is the breadth or bigneſs of the earth. Whence take this double Inference;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, If the earth be ſuch a great thing, that a man cannot perceive the breadth or dimenſions of it, then how great are the heavens! The earth in compariſon of the heavens is but as a point, 'tis as little as is imaginable. O what a broad thing is heaven, if the earth be ſuch, that we cannot reach the breadth of it!</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If the earth be ſo great, how great is God, who made the heavens and the earth too! That's it which God would lead <hi>Job</hi> to the conſideration of, even of his own infinite greatneſs. How great is God, who made this great earth! To him (as the prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>chap.</hi> 40.15, 16.) <hi>The Nations, the people (of the earth) are but as the drop of a bucket, and as the duſt of the ballance: He weighs the mountains in ſcales, and the hills in a ballance:</hi> He holds the duſt as one ſingle grain in his hand. What a nothing are all things to God, ſeeing the earth is a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the heavens! God puts the queſtion to <hi>Job, Haſt thou perceived the breadth of the earth?</hi> and we may put that queſtion into this negative Propoſition, O <hi>Job,</hi> Thou haſt not perceived the breadth of the earth. The wiſeſt of men know not the breadth or bigneſs of the earth. Some have undertaken to tell us how great the circle of the earth is; but theirs are but gueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: though ſomewhat may be ſaid that way, yet no man can give it exactly; and therefore the <hi>Roman</hi> Orator attempting to write about the earth and the dimenſions of it, prefaceth or apologizeth thus for himſelf;<note place="margin">De Geographia dabo operam ut tibi ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciam, ſed nihil certi polliceor; magnum opus eſt. <hi>Cicero ad Atticum. l. 2. ep. 4.</hi>

                  <p>Further, When the Lord ſaith, <hi>Declare if thou knoweſt it all,</hi> his meaning is not, <hi>If thou haſt any knowledge at all about it all;</hi> for there is no wiſe, no underſtanding man, but hath ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

There are many that know ſomething, and ſome that know many things; yet none that know all things, no not the all of any one thing. The Apoſtle ſpeaking of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual things, ſaith, <hi>We know in part;</hi> and the truth is, we know but a part of natural things, of the ſea, of the earth, and we know them but in part. So then, when the Lord ſaith, <hi>If thou knoweſt it all,</hi> his meaning may be this, if thou haſt a diſtinct and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrative knowledge of the thing, <hi>Declare it.</hi> I know thou mayeſt give conjectures, and propoſe probabilities; but I know alſo, that thou neither knoweſt it all, nor the all of it. God hath given us a certain knowledge about things that refer to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, and to ſalvation, to them we muſt ſtick and abide by them; but as to theſe things, all that we know, is but little, and about that little we labour under many uncertainties. <hi>Declare if thou knoweſt it all.</hi>

                     <hi>Truly to know God the onely true God, and Jeſus Christ, whom he hath ſent, is eternal life,</hi> while we live here in this world, but to know the true God, and Jeſus Chriſt, whom he hath ſent, fully, yea to know any thing fully, is reſerved for us in that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life which we wait for in the world to come.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, The due order of the Affections, when they ſhall ever be ſet upon right objects, and upon them in a right meaſure.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The due motion of the Will, when it ſhall ever chuſe that which is good, and nothing but good.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The clear and unerring light of the Underſtanding. The proper object of the Underſtanding is truth. The chief or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament and delight of the Underſtanding is the knowledge of the truth. And the Underſtanding is not more debaſed and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured by not endeavouring to know, than an underſtanding man is vexed and troubled, when he cannot compaſs the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of that which he deſires and endeavours to know. Indeed <hi>Solomon</hi> (the moſt knowing man among all the ſons of men) hath concluded (<hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 1.15.) <hi>That in much wiſdome there is much grief, and that he that encreaſeth knowledge, encreaſeth ſorrow.</hi> Yet this grief and ſorrow ariſe not from knowledge attained, but from the great pains, ſtudy, and travel, which we take in this world for the attainment of it; or from the doubts and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties which remain in our minds about many things, when we have got the beſt and cleareſt knowledge of them attainable in this life: Whereas in our heavenly ſtate, we ſhall neither have any trouble in getting knowledge, nor ſhall any doubt or uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty remain in our minds about the things we know.

                  <p>And thus we may anſwer that of the Apoſtle (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.8.) ſaying, That in heaven, <hi>Knowledge ſhall vaniſh away.</hi> What, nothing but ignorance in heaven? Surely, nothing more unſutable to, nor unbecoming the glory of that ſtate. Ignorance may bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be the Mother of Devotion here (as Papiſts with ignorance enough have affirmed) than in heaven the companion of our joy. The Apoſtle then means, that ſuch knowledge as now we have, ſhall vaniſh, that is, knowledge ſo gotten as now it is. In heaven there are no Schools, nor Univerſities, nor Tutors, nor Teachers. Again, Knowledge of ſo imperfect a degree as now
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:48669:90"/> it is of, ſhall vaniſh away; The knowledge which <hi>Solomon</hi> had on earth, will be but ignorance, compared to the knowledge which the Saints have and ſhall have in heaven; His largeneſs of heart (though like the ſand of the ſea) will be but narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart, compared with the enlargements which Saints ſhall have there.

<pb n="164" facs="tcp:48669:91"/> together in any one ſubject, yet) met together in this Text, <hi>Light and darkneſs;</hi> and there is ſome, yea not a little darkneſs in this queſtion about the light. We need a great meaſure of Divine Light to anſwer this queſtion about the Light.</p>
                  <q>Where is the way where light dwelleth?</q>
                  <p>Tell me, O <hi>Job,</hi> if thou canſt, where light lodgeth, where it repoſeth it ſelf, when the Sun is gone down, and departed out of thy ſight? Tell me what way leadeth to the lodging of light? The words (as Interpreters give it) have in them a poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>cal tincture, as if the Sun ſetting, retired to his chamber, as we do, when the light and buſineſs of the day is ended. <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks of the Sun <hi>as a Bridegroom coming out of his chamber</hi> (Pſal. 19.5.) And when his race (as to us) is run every day, he hath a chamber ready for him: not that the Sun doth at all end its motion, or ſit down to reſt, but becauſe it ſeems to reſt, when it goeth down to us. As if the Lord had ſaid, Haſt thou travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the place of the Suns riſing and ſetting? <hi>Where is the way where the light dwelleth?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There may be a threefold anſwer given to theſe queſtions, as light is taken properly for the natural light, the light of the day, cauſed by the Suns approach; and as darkneſs is taken properly for natural darkneſs, cauſed by the with-drawing of the Sun.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Some (becauſe the word <hi>dwelleth</hi> notes a ſtay or an abode, for ſuch is a dwelling place) anſwer the queſtion <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ographically,</hi> and ſay, <hi>light dwelleth under the Poles.</hi> There are two poles of the earth, the Northern and the Southern, under both which interchangeably light and darkneſs abide ſix moneths together; and becauſe of the long ſtay and abode of light and darkneſs there, Geographers reckon and conclude the dwelling of light and the place of darkneſs to be there, and that therefore the Sun hath two dwelling houſes, one in the North, the other in the South.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, When Aſtronomers anſwer theſe queſtions, <hi>Where is the way where light dwelleth? and where is the place of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?</hi> They ſay, <hi>The Eaſt</hi> is the place of light; and <hi>the Weſt,</hi> the dwelling of darkneſs: And the reaſon given is this, Becauſe the Sun riſeth in the Eaſt, and goes down in the Weſt, leaving
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:48669:91"/> the World,<note place="margin">Forvide Titan obitus pariter tecum Alcides vid it &amp; Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus; novitque tuas utraſque domos. <hi>Sen. in Herc. Act. 4.</hi> Alludere vide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur ad ſignorum Zodiaci ſpatia, per quae Sol curſum ſuum perragit, quae ab aſtrologis <hi>Manſiones vel Domus</hi> ſolent appellari. Itáque Zona il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la ſive faſcia Zodiaci in cujus medio protenditur ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliptica eſt via ſolis, qui in tot habitare domus dicitur, quot in illa ſunt ſigna. <hi>Bold.</hi>
                     </note> that half of the World upon which it ſhined in the day, over-ſhadowed with darkneſs. It is by the acceſs and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, by the riſing and ſetting of the Sun, that we enjoy light or are wrapped up in darkneſs. And ſo Eaſt and Weſt are called by the ancient Poets the houſes or dwellings of the Sun.</p>
                  <p>Aſtronomers have found out, according to their doctrine, twelve houſes or dwelling places of the Sun; they imagine a girdle or bond paſſing quite through the heavens, which they call <hi>the Zodiack,</hi> and there a line which they call the <hi>Ecliptick,</hi> in which the Sun moveth, or which is the way of the light; and in this line, they place <hi>the twelve ſigns:</hi> the firſt of which the Sun entreth the firſt moneth of the year, and is called <hi>Aries,</hi> the ſecond <hi>Taurus,</hi> the third <hi>Gemini, &amp;c.</hi> Theſe are onely fictions by which they repreſent the gradual motions of the Sun in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſeaſons of the year, and they call them <hi>Manſion Houſes</hi> or <hi>Dwellings of the Sun.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, According to vulgar underſtanding we may anſwer theſe queſtions, <hi>Where is the way where light dwelleth, &amp;c.</hi> Plainly thus, Light dwelleth in the Sun, there light abides, and from thence ſhines to us. The Sun is the Veſſel or Store-houſe of light, the Luminary of the World by day, as the Moon and Stars are by nigh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. And as for darkneſs, that takes its place every where, as ſoon as the Sun leaves any place. As often as the Sun continuing his circular progreſs, viſits the other Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere, da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>kneſs takes poſſeſſion of this. Light and darkneſs take their turns; the one alwayes going off, when and where the other enters upon the ſtage of the world.</p>
                  <p>Now though Philoſophers, with our own experience, tell us, that the reaſon of this, is, the acceſs and receſs of the Sun; yet it is unknown to us, how God hath thus tempered the courſe of nature, that day and night ſhould not be alwayes alike in any part of the World, but vary in both the Hemiſpheres, and that in the ſame Hemiſphere there ſhould be ſuch a ſetled inequality in the length of the nights and days. This dependeth wholly upon the will of God, who thus ſtated the motions of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly bodies from the very beginning.</p>
                  <p>If it be asked, Why doth the Lord put theſe queſtions to <hi>Job, Where is the way where light dwelleth?</hi> Seeing every one may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, light is in the Sun, light ſhines in and fills the Air, while
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:48669:92"/> the Sun is up; and darkneſs filleth the air when the Sun is gone down, darkneſs being the privation or want of light; or dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (according to the uſual definition of it) <hi>being the ſhadow of the Earth coming between us and the Sun.</hi> When the opacous or thick body of the Earth interpoſeth between us and the Sun, darkneſs followeth. And if this be all, there ſeemeth not to be much difficulty in knowing where the light dwelleth, and where the place of darkneſs is; therefore ſurely that was not the ſole intendment of God in putting theſe queſtions to <hi>Job.</hi> But when he ſaith, <hi>Where is the way where light dwelleth? &amp;c.</hi> It is as if he had ſaid, <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ght and darkneſs? Or how it cometh to paſs, that one part of the World hath light while the other is covered with darkneſs, and how light returns to that other part? Haſt thou made this tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and viciſſitude of light and darkneſs, or procured that the day ſhould be long in the ſame country, at one ſeaſon of the year, and ſhort at another? Hast thou diſpoſed the Sun to make ſhort nights in Summer, and long in Winter?</hi> This the underſtanding of man is not well able to comprehend, much leſs his power to effect. Onely the infinite wiſdom of God hath put light and darkneſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this method, and given them their certain ſeaſons. And that this is the meaning of the Text, we may gather more clearly from the next verſe; for the Lord having ſaid, <hi>Where is the way where light dwelleth? and as for darkneſs, where is the place there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of?</hi> preſently adds,

                     <hi>A Tabernacle</hi> (not a ſtanding houſe) <hi>is ſet for the Sun</hi> (Pſal. 19.4.) A Tabernacle is a moveable houſe. The Sun hath a houſe every where, but it keeps houſe or abides no where. 'Tis not only alwayes moving in its place, but daily removing to other places; and ſo, conſequentially, is darkneſs. As it is thus with natural light and darkneſs, about which the queſtion is literally propoſed, ſo with civil light and darkneſs, about which the queſtion alſo is intended. Theſe have their places, their dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and 'tis ſeldome that they dwell long in any one place. Light and darkneſs are not more interchangeable in the Air, than joy and ſorrow are in the ſtates and conditions of men.</p>
                  <p>We may likewiſe conclude, that ſpiritual light and darkneſs have their houſes and their dwellings. Spiritual light, both the light of knowledge, and the light of comfort, dwell,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, In Chriſt himſelf. In him as Mediator, <hi>all fulneſs dwells, (Col.</hi> 1.19.) <hi>and of his fulneſs we all receive grace for grace,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:48669:93"/> (John</hi> 1.16.) I may ſay alſo light for light, light of every ſort, and light in every degree, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="4 letters">

                  <p>Secondly, Theſe lights dwell in the hearts of every true belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. Faith and light can never be ſeparated: Though ſome who have faith may be in the dark, yet light is not ſeparated; it is onely clouded, eclipſed or hidden from them. All believers are ſo much in a ſtate of light, that they are called light (<hi>Eph.</hi> 5.8.) and many of them live in a plentiful enjoyment of light. A worthy man of the former generation, lying upon his death-bed, a friend asked him whether the light ſhining into the room did not offend him? he anſw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> putting his hand upon his heart, <hi>Here I have light e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.</hi> The heart of a godly man is the houſe of ſpiritual light, there he hath and holds the light of divine knowledge about the things of the Goſpel, and the light of divine comfort ariſing from that knowledge. It is alſo reported of Mr. <hi>Deering</hi> our Countrey-man, that in his laſt ſickneſs, and towards his end, being ſet upright in his bed for his eaſe, a friend requeſted him, that he would ſpeak ſomething for the edification and comfort of thoſe about him: Whereupon, the Sun ſhining in his face, he took occaſion to ſpeak thus, <hi>There is but one Sun in the world, and there is but one Sun of righteouſneſs which graciouſly ſhineth upon me;</hi> ſpeaking further, he concluded thus, <hi>I bleſs God, I have ſo much light of joy and comfort in my ſoul, that were it put to my wiſh or choice, I had rather a thouſand times die than live.</hi> As the hearts of theſe worthies were the dwelling place of light, ſo is the heart of every godly perſon in his meaſure and degree; the light of knowledge and of joy abide there. The Apoſtle ſaith (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6.) <hi>God who commanded light to ſhine out of darkneſs, hath ſhined into our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> And where that ſhine of God gives the light of knowledge, the light of comfort cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held, unleſs it be for a ſeaſon, that the ſoul may rejoyce the more in the end, and at laſt without end.

                  <p>Laſtly, There is an eternal light, the light of Glory, and that hath a certain dwelling place; that light dwelleth alwayes in heaven; and the Saints at reſt in heaven, dwell alwayes in that light. Eternal glory is called <hi>the inheritance of the ſaints in light, (Col.</hi> 1.12.)</p>
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:48669:93"/>
                  <p>Again, Spiritual darkneſs hath its place; and we ſhould la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to know the place of that darkneſs, to avoid it. Ignorance is ſpiritual darkneſs, and that dwells in the heart of every man by nature. All that continue in that ſad condition, <hi>have their underſtanding darkened through the ignorance that is in them,</hi> (Eph. 4.18.) and they who now are in the light, were once in the dark, yea they were darkneſs (<hi>Eph.</hi> 5.8.) Let it alſo be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, in whomſoever this darkneſs of ſin and ignorance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bides, they muſt abide under the darkneſs of wrath and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for ever. The place where that darkneſs dwells <hi>is hell,</hi> and there <hi>outer darkneſs</hi> (as 'tis often called in the Goſpel) dwells, even ſuch darkneſs as wherein the damned are not onely out of the poſſeſſion of the leaſt ray or glimmering of light, but without any hope or expectation of it. Hell is quite beyond the bound or boundaries of light; there's darkneſs and thick darkneſs, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but darkneſs. Thus we ſee light and darkneſs have their places, natural light and darkneſs have theirs, and ſo have ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and eternal light and darkneſs.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, From the ſcope of theſe two verſes,</p>
                  <p>Obſerve;
<q>It is God who diſpoſeth and ordereth light and darkneſs.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The queſtion was put to <hi>Job,</hi> whether he had diſpoſed of them; but he could not aſſume to himſelf, that he had <hi>taken or laid the light to the bound thereof, or knew the paths to the houſe thereof.</hi> Light and darkneſs are at the diſpoſe, and under the command of God alone. And as the work or power of God is wonderful in the diſpoſe of natural light and darkneſs, ſo 'tis much more won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; in the diſpoſe of civil, ſpiritual, and eternal light and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful theſe the Lord <hi>taketh to their bound, and knoweth the paths to their houſe. I form light and create darkneſs</hi> (ſaith the Lord, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.7.) What light and darkneſs doth the Lord there ſpeak of? Surely of civil light and darkneſs, as the next words im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, <hi>I make peace and create evil;</hi> I make and create them, I alſo direct and appoint them whither to go, whether to a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or to a man only, whether to this or that man or Nation. Darkneſs is of me as truly as light.</p>
                  <p>And that not only civil, but ſpiritual and eternal light and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs are at Gods diſpoſe, is as evident from the Scriptures of
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:48669:94"/> truth. Some lands may be called <hi>lands of light</hi> (like <hi>Goſhen</hi>) others (like <hi>Egypt</hi> under that three days plague) may be called lands of darkneſs. Of ſuch lands that complaint is made (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 74.20.) <hi>The dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty.</hi> All places of the earth full <hi>of ignorance,</hi> not knowing God, <hi>of atheiſme,</hi> not acknowledging God, <hi>of idolatry,</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping falſe gods, or the true God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>alſly, may be called lands of darkneſs, or the dark places of the earth. Now as the Lord maketh one land a place of ſpiritual light, ſo he leaveth an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other to be a place of darkneſs. And he often maketh changes from darkneſs to light, that's mercy, and from light to dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that's wrath, in the ſame lands. Some lands which had ſate in darkneſs for ages and generations, the Lord hath viſited with Goſpel light; and ſome lands, which for ages and generations had that light, are now laid in darkneſs. How ſad a witneſs of this are the anciently famous ſeats of the <hi>Aſian</hi> and <hi>African</hi> Churches, now under <hi>Mahometan</hi> power!</p>
                  <p>And further, as the Lord diſpoſeth that outward ſpiritual light and darkneſs, giving the knowledge of the Goſpel to, or taking it away from Nations, as he pleaſeth; ſo he diſpo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eth inward light or darkneſs to every ſoul. Some gracious ſouls walk in the light of Gods countenance, and under the ſweet ſhinings of his face every day; others, <hi>who</hi> alſo (as the Prophet ſpeaks, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.10.) <hi>Fear the Lord, and obey the voice of his ſervants, walk in darkneſs, and ſee no light.</hi> Now, whence cometh this difference? Is it not of the Lord, who hath the command of our joys and of our ſorrows, and who appoints this kind of light and darkneſs their ſeveral and ſpecial places, according to the ſoveraignty of his own Will?</p>
                  <p>From all that hath been ſaid, we may draw down this conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which the Lord did chiefly aim at in dealing with <hi>Job; That we are to own and acknowledge the hand of God in every condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> be it light, or be it darkneſs; be it joy, or be it ſorrow; 'tis all of God. There is nothing which concerns either the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort or trouble of man, but comes forth from God, and is order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him; like as in all ages and revolutions of time, light and darkneſs have held their courſe, and kept their place, according to his inſtitution and direction. <hi>Job</hi> was in darkneſs, both as to his outward and inward eſtate; his body was pained, his ſoul
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:48669:94"/> was grieved, anguiſh <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> ſpirit; and God would have him ſee, know, and acknowledge his hand in all. As if he had ſaid, <hi>Thou canſt no more diſpoſe the peace or trouble, the light or darkneſs of thy condition, than thou canſt diſpoſe of light or darkneſs in the air.</hi> All our changes, from darkneſs to light, from light to darkneſs, proceed from the unchangeable God. And as light and darkneſs have their conſtant turns in the air, ſo they have very frequent turns in the life of every man.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, they who when God cauſeth darkneſs to cover and compaſs them about, do not acquieſce and reſt in his good pleaſure, but murmur and are tumultuous; theſe (I ſay) do as if they would take upon them to order the courſe of light and darkneſs in the world; theſe do no otherwiſe, than as if at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night they ſhould call for day, or at mid-day for night. Diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed ſouls are like ſick bodies; they who are ſick or ill at eaſe, cannot bear either night or day; in the day they deſire night, and in the night day: ſo it is with them of ſickly ſouls. Such are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten heard ſaying in the morning, Would God it were evening, and in the evening, Would God it were morning: Nothing pleaſeth them. Did we acknowledge the hand of God in making it night, we ſhould ſit down quietly in our darkeſt night, as to impatience, even while we are moſt earneſtly praying for the return of morning light. Impatience was in a great meaſure <hi>Jobs</hi> failing, though he had a great meaſure of patience. He made (as we ſay) <hi>an ado</hi> in the night of his trouble, as if he would have made it day when God had made it night and darkneſs with him. O remember, the way of light, and the place of darkneſs, the bounds and paths of both are in the hand, or at the command of God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, In that the Lord put this among his own great works, and takes it out of the hand of <hi>Job,</hi> or of any other creature, to order light and darkneſs,</p>
                  <p>Note;
<q>The work of God in ordering light and darkneſs is wonderful.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And we cannot but be convinced that it is ſo, if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; Firſt, The conſtant ſucceſſion of day and night in all places. As ſure as the day cometh, the night will come; and as ſure as the night is come, day is coming. There is an unchangeable change

                     </gap>or a moment in their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings or returnings. Secondly, If we conſider light and darkneſs as to their increaſe or decreaſe in any place, thus, <hi>Day unto day uttereth ſpeech, and night unto night ſheweth knowledge</hi> (P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>al. 19.2.) which ſome think was a well known Adage or Proverbial Speech among the <hi>Jews,</hi> importing the power of God over, and his guidance of them both. God brings the light to the bound of it, to day at this hour, or minute of the hour, to morrow at that. There is a conſtant inconſtancy, an uneven evenneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween light and darkneſs upon the face of the earth. We never have light or darkneſs twice of the ſame length in the ſame place and ſeaſon; yet they ever keep their place and ſeaſon all the world over: where you had them the laſt year, upon ſuch a day, there you may have them this, without a moments variation, though they have varied their courſe many moments every day ſince. Thus exactly doth the Lord take or lead the light to its bound, and knows the paths to the houſe thereof.</p>
                  <p>And as there is a great glory coming to God, in ordering light and darkneſs, as to the outward face of things; ſo there is a greater, as to the inward ſtate of his people, their ſoul-ſtate. And though the Lord doth not keep ſuch a conſtant courſe in that, yet he obſerveth a rule in all the revolutions of it. We have ſometimes light and ſometimes darkneſs in our ſouls: Now the light of comfort increaſeth towards us, and anon the night of ſorrow darkeneth upon us. Our ſouls meet often with theſe turns and changes. Let us adore the wiſdom, and ſubmit to the holy will of God in all. For though ſoul-light be alwayes deſirable, as well as comfortable, yet ſoul-darkneſs may ſometimes be uſeful; and this uſe it hath, as often as it comes, even to try how we can truſt God in the dark; as alſo to let the world know that we are reſolved through grace to keep cloſe to the light of comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, how long ſoever we are kept from, or are at a loſs for the light of promiſes.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, We may conſider from this Text, that as light hath its ſpecial houſes or dwellings, ſo it hath a ſpecial way to its dwelling chalked out (as it were) and appointed by God. And is there not a way, a path, to ſpiritual, to eternal light? The way to theſe lights is Chriſt, He is <hi>the Way, the Truth, and the Life</hi> (John 14.6.) He is the true, the onely way to life, to
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:48669:95"/> ſpiritual life and light; yea, he is the way to eternal light and life. Holineſs and faith in Chriſt are the paſſing way to this light, but Chriſt himſelf is the way procuring light. <hi>Without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God, and without holineſs no man can ſee God.</hi> Chriſt is the meriting way, faith and holineſs are the qualifying way, leading us to the houſe and dwelling of this light. As ſin and unbelief, or the ſin of Unbelief, is the way leading to eternal dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (O how many go this way to the generation of their fathers, where they ſhall never ſee light (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.19.) ſo faith and holineſs, or holy Faith, is the way, the path to everlaſting light and life.</p>
                  <p>Thus much of the enquiry made about <hi>the way and path of light and darkneſs,</hi> which as they are literally to be underſtood of natural light and darkneſs: ſo by them God led <hi>Job,</hi> and in him us, to conſider his diſpoſure of all ſorts of light and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p>Now, That <hi>Job</hi> might be convinced of his own ignorance in, and inſufficiency for an anſwer to theſe queſtions, God calls him to conſider the late beginning and ſhortneſs of his life, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge being gathered up by experience, and length of days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording both time and opportunity for the gathering up of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences. <hi>Job</hi> was but of yeſterday, in compariſon of the day wherein the interchanges of light and darkneſs were appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and therefore (ſhould it be ſuppoſed that days could teach him how theſe things came to paſs, yet) he could not but be much unprepared for a ready and ſatisfying anſwer to theſe que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions.</p>

                  <p>But I rather adhere to our own reading, <hi>Knoweſt thou it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou waſt then born?</hi> That is, becauſe thou livedſt then, and haſt lived ever ſince, and ſo haſt gathered up the knowledge of theſe things by obſervation.

I know, and thou muſt needs confeſs, it is not <hi>becauſe thou waſt then born;</hi> waſt thou?

There is a double reading and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of this verſe.</p>
                  <p>Some both of the ancients and moderns expound it <hi>ironically,</hi> as if the Lord to humble <hi>Job,</hi> put a ſcorn upon him in ſuch a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour as this: <hi>Doubtleſs thou knoweſt the dwelling of light, and the place of darkneſs, thou knoweſt when and how I ſetled the motions of the heavens, and the changes which they make here in this lower world;</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Our days are unfixed, as to us, our life is uncertain.</hi> They that reckon upon many days in this life, uſually fall ſhort of their reckoning. 'Tis or ſhould be matter of humiliation to us, that we are ſhort-liv'd, ſhort breath'd creatures; we who were born into the world but the other day, ſhall in a few days (no man knows how few) paſs out of the world again.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, The Lord, by this queſtion, would teach <hi>Job,</hi> that it is he who taketh care of us, and orders both our coming in, and our going out of this world. It is God, by whom the days are
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:48669:97"/> numbred, and the years appointed which we have had and are to have here below. And as the days of our life, ſo the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which we ſhall live in, reſteth and dependeth upon the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and providence of God. As we took no care of our ſelves, nor could, before we were; ſo all the care we take for our ſelves, while we are, can avail us nothing without God. <hi>Which of us by taking care, can add one cubit to his ſtature</hi> (Matth. 6.25.) and which of us by taking care, can add one moment to his life, all is in the hand of God. And 'tis our duty to live as free from all troubleſome cares while we are in the world, as we were free from any care at all before we came into the world. It is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that God hath undertaken for us, and would have us ſit down in his care of us. Chriſt ſaid (<hi>Matth.</hi> 10.29, 30.) with reſpect to ſufferings, <hi>Fear not, for are not two ſparrows ſold for a farthing? and one of them falleth not to the ground, without your Father.</hi> It is God, who orders and diſpoſeth the life of a ſilly bird, and by him the <hi>very hairs of our head</hi> (worthleſs excreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions) <hi>are numbred;</hi> ſurely then, the days of your lives, and all the changes of them, are ordered, diſpoſed, and numbred by him. And if ſo, we ſhould in this ſenſe, be as quiet, and as much at eaſe in our ſpirits, concerning the things of this life, as we were before we lived. Light had its dwelling place appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and darkneſs was diſpoſed of without any care of ours; and all our care can neither create light for us, nor remove any dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that is upon us. Let us onely be careful of that duty we are called to, and leave the burden of our cares to him who hath called for them (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.22.) and would have us reſt in this aſſurance, that <hi>he careth for us</hi> (1 Pet. 5.7.) what cannot he command for us in our places, who commands light and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to their places; therefore it will be our wiſdome, at once to take as much pains, and as little care as we can.</p>

Thoſe places out of which God is ſaid either to bring good for the uſe
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:48669:98"/> and comfort of man, or evil for his hurt and puniſhment, are uſually in Scripture expreſſed by this Word. Thus ſpake <hi>Moſes,</hi> encouraging the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to obedience (<hi>Deut.</hi> 28.12.) <hi>The Lord ſhall open unto thee his good treaſure, the heaven to give thee rain unto thy land in his ſeaſon, &amp;c.</hi> And God hath his juſt and righteous treaſures of wrath, even as men heap up and have their evil and unrighteous treaſures of ſin (<hi>Deut.</hi> 32.34. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.5.) Thus the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> tells ungodly rich men (<hi>chap.</hi> 5.3.) <hi>Ye have heaped treaſure together for the laſt days.</hi> Which may be underſtood of their getting their treaſures of riches ſo unrighteouſly in their days, as would prove a heaping together of wrath againſt themſelves in the laſt days or day of the laſt Judgement.</p>
                  <p>Treaſures of good or evil imply three things:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The ſecrecy of what is laid up.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The ſafety of it, or that it is ſurely laid up.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That there is ſtore or great quantities of it laid up. A little is not a treaſure. The ſnow may well be called a treaſure in all theſe reſpects; for 'tis ſecretly laid up, no man can ſee it; and 'tis ſafely laid up, none can reach or take it away; there are alſo vaſt quantities or great abundance of it. <hi>Haſt thou entred into the treaſures of the ſnow?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As if the Lord had ſaid, <hi>Thou O Job, haſt often ſeen the ſnow fall, and thou mayeſt eaſily perceive that it falls out of the clouds; but haſt thou aſcended, or can any aſcend unto thoſe airy regions, where ſnow is generated and laid up, as in a treaſure? If not, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then no man can aſcend to heaven, and there ſearch out or diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the myſteries and ſecrets of Wiſdom and Juſtice in my works here below, unleſs by the wings of faith and the light of a ſpiritual un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, which ſits down ſatisfied in this concluſion, that all is wiſely and juſtly done, which God doth, whether in heaven or earth.</hi> To bring <hi>Job</hi> to this acknowledgment, was the deſign and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of God (as hath been toucht before) in all the queſtions propounded to him in this and the next Chapter.</p>
                  <q>Haſt thou entred into the treaſures of the ſnow?</q>
                  <p>What the ſnow is, the nature and the wonders of it, was ſpoken of and ſhewed, at the ſixth verſe of the 37<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter.</p>
                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:48669:99"/>
                  <p>All that I ſhall further add for the opening of this queſtion, is, that when God ſpeaks here of the <hi>treaſures of ſnow,</hi> we are not to underſtand it, as if he had great heaps of ſnow formally amaſſed up together in any place of the air, as men lay up trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of money or corn, or of any other uſeful matter; but the words are an elegant Metaphor, the meaning onely this, God hath abundance of ſnow ready at his will and diſpoſe, at his call and command, whenſoever or whereſoever he is pleaſed to make uſe of it; for 'tis as eaſie with God at any time to draw out and powre down abundance of ſnow, as if he had infinite ſtore of it kept alwayes by him. He no ſooner ſpeaks the word, but the face of the earth is covered, and its boſomes filled with ſilver ſhowers. <hi>Haſt thou entred into the treaſures of the ſnow?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>Or haſt thou ſeen the treaſures of the hail?</q>
                  <p>Theſe treaſures of hail are of the ſame nature with thoſe of ſnow, and ſo to be underſtood as the former; but there is a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in the form of ſnow and hail, though not in the matter out of which ſnow and hail are formed. <hi>Hail</hi> (ſay Naturaliſts) <hi>is a hot vapour, drawn up to the middle region of the air, whence falling, it is frozen in paſſage into leſſer or greater ſtones or grains of ice.</hi> Theſe hail-ſtones are ſometimes powred down ſo great in quantity, and often in ſuch great quantities, that it may well be ſaid, there are treaſures of them. And when the Lord puts this queſtion to <hi>Job, Haſt thou ſeen the treaſures of the hail?</hi> he ſeems to allude to thoſe who inſpect the publick treaſure of any Kingdom or Common-wealth, receiving in and iſſuing out the revenues of it, as occaſion requires, and as they are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. As if the Lord had ſaid, <hi>Haſt thou, O Job, like ſome great Lord Treaſurer, taken a view of theſe ſtores? I know thou wilt confeſs thou haſt not ſeen them with thy bodily eyes; I know alſo thou haſt not reacht them clearly with the eye of thy mind or underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; even thoſe treaſures are greater than thou canſt imagin.</hi> All that which thou haſt any way ſeen, is leſs than the leaſt part of that which thou haſt not ſeen. <hi>Haſt thou ſeen the treaſures of the hail?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From both the parts of the verſe, Note, Firſt;
<q>God hath ſtore of ſnow and hail.</q>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:48669:99"/>
                  <p>Treaſures are not made up with a little. Chriſt ſaith (<hi>Mat.</hi> 12.35.) <hi>A good man hath a good treaſure in his heart, and an evil man an evil treaſure there;</hi> becauſe the one bringeth forth good things, and the other evil things out of his heart; there both good and evil perſons keep their ſtore of good and evil things, and there good men ſhould have, and evil men alwayes have a great deal in ſtore. For this reaſon alſo God is ſaid <hi>to bring the wind out of his treaſures</hi> (Pſal. 135.7.) He hath much wind and mighty winds at his diſpoſe. God who hath made all things by his Word or Will, can have as much of every thing as he will.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Note;
<q>God hath ſnow and hail ready for his ſervice.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He hath them as in a Store-houſe or Treaſury. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> built <hi>Treaſure Cities</hi> (Exod. 1.11.) or <hi>places of receit,</hi> in which he kept either his publick treaſure of Gold and Silver, or his Artillery and Ammunition for War, or great quantities of Corn and Grain againſt a time of need. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Every ſcribe which is inſtructed unto the Kingdom of Heaven, is like unto a man that is an Houſholder, which bringeth forth out of his treaſure things both new and old</hi> (Matth. 13.52.) that is, he is not to ſeek, he hath them in a readineſs for uſe, and ſo is himſelf ready to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good word and work, when any have uſe of him for good. We may be ſure God is never to ſeek, nor (as we ſay) out of ſorts, for any kind of means or inſtruments to carry on his ſervice, and to effect any purpoſe of his, whether in wrath againſt the wicked, or in favour of ſuch as fear him.</p>
                  <p>Again, In that the Lord ſaith, <hi>Haſt thou entred, &amp;c. Haſt thou ſeen, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note, Thirdly;
<q>No man knoweth, nor can any man conceive, what treaſures and ſtores, what abundance either of good or evil, of wrath or love God hath.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>(<hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.11.) <hi>Who knoweth the power of thine anger?</hi> I may ſay alſo, who knoweth the power of thy love? that is, it is not known, no nor knowable, what powers God can put forth either in anger or love. <hi>Eye hath not ſeen</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9.)
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:48669:100"/> 
                     <hi>nor ear heard, neither have entred into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.</hi> And as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations of God for them that love him, ſo his preparations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them that hate him, are ſuch as no man hath ſo much as ſeen, much leſs entred into. If the treaſures of ſnow and hail exceed our conceptions, what do the treaſures of fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone in the bottomleſs pit? what is the pile of fire and much wood in <hi>Tophet,</hi> which the breath of the Lord, like a ſtream of brimſtone kindleth? (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.33.)</p>
                  <p>But ſome may ſay, why hath the Lord ſuch vaſt treaſures of ſnow and hail? what are they good for, or to what uſe do they ſerve? What the uſe or uſefulneſs of the ſnow is, as well as the nature of it, was ſhewed in ſome particulars at the ſixth verſe of the 37<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter. Here God himſelf declares what uſe he hath of ſnow and hail, or what ſervice he puts them to, in the next words.</p>
                  <q>
                     <bibl>

                  <p>As God hath made nothing in vain, ſo he doth not reſerve or lay up any thing in vain. <hi>The Lord is a God of knowledge</hi> (1 Sam. 2.3.) <hi>by him,</hi> as our <hi>actions,</hi> ſo his own <hi>are weighed.</hi> This verſe ſhews one uſe or end of his <hi>reſerving ſtores</hi> of ſnow and hail, and that an extraordinary one. The ordinary uſe of ſnow and hail is for ſome good or benefit to men indifferently, as the Sun ſhines and the rain falls, whether good or bad. The uſe here ſpoken of is onely for the hurt and puniſhment of bad men. Some reſtrain the antecedent of this relative <hi>which,</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the verſe, to the hail onely, becauſe no mention is made (ſay they) in Scripture of any hurt done by ſnow; but of hurt done by hail we read more than once there.<note place="margin">

The word rendred <hi>war,</hi> ſprings from a root ſignifying to <hi>eat,</hi> becauſe the ſword of war is a great eater, and devours the bodies of men. Now when God breaks forth in anger againſt obſtinate ſinners, his enemies, and brings any ſore and deſtroying judgement upon them, he is ſaid to have war with them, or to make war againſt them: <hi>Who would ſet the briars and thorns in battel againſt me, ſaith the Lord</hi> (Iſa. 27.4.)</p>
                  <p>So then, Both the time of trouble and the day of battel and war ſpoken of in this Text, are the time and day of the Lords wrath and vengeance declared againſt his implacable and incorri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible enemies: Snow and hail are treaſured up and reſerved <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this time of trouble, againſt this day of battel and war.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence Note, Firſt;
<q>God hath a check upon all creatures.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He reſerves or ſtops them as, and as long as himſelf pleaſeth. He can prohibit ſnow and hail and command them not to come. As they will ſurely come at any time, if he commands them to come, ſo if he commands them not to come till ſuch or ſuch a time, they will not come till then. The ſoveraignty of God is abſolute o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the creature. When <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> underſtanding retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to him, then <hi>he praiſed and honoured him that liveth for ever</hi> (Dan. 4.34.) <hi>whoſe dominion is an everlaſting dominion,</hi> and confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed (<hi>verſ.</hi> 35.) that <hi>he doth according to his will in the army of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;</hi> that is, the Angels, the Sun, Moon, and Stars, as alſo the Meteors, Snow and Hail, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all, or any of theſe, are <hi>the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of heaven,</hi> an army raiſed in the heavens; in this army God doth according to his Will, as well as <hi>among the inhabitants of the earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="185" facs="tcp:48669:101"/>
                  <p>Secondly, Obſerve,
<q>God is very patient, he doth not preſently take vengeance, nor bring trouble, though he be alwayes provided for it, and able to do it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>As he <hi>retaineth not his anger for ever,</hi> ſo he reſtraineth it long, <hi>becauſe he delighteth in mercy</hi> (Mic. 7.18.) As mercy moves the Lord ſpeedily to receive repenting ſinners into fav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ur, ſo it prevails with him to be very ſlow in ſending judgements upon thoſe that are impenitent. The Lord reſerved or kept back the waters of the flood a hundred and twenty years from drowning the Old World; though, as they provoked and even dared him to do it every day by their preſumptuous ſinnings againſt his warnings, ſo he was able to do it any hour or moment of the day.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly Note,
<q>Trouble hath its time or ſeaſon.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is a time for every purpoſe under the Sun (<hi>Eccl.</hi> 3.1.) Men have times for their purpoſes, and ſo hath God (much more) for his; he hath his times for quietneſs and times for trouble. And as ſin is the cauſe and ſourſe of all trouble, ſo when ſin is ripe, trouble is ready. When men have filled up the meaſure of their ſin, then God pouts down trouble upon them, or makes it a time of trouble, that they may taſte and ſee, and be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced how evil and how bitter a thing it is to ſin againſt the Lord. The <hi>Amorites</hi> were full of iniquity, when God ſpake to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> (Gen. 15.16.) but their iniquity was not full, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their time of trouble, the time when their Land ſpewed them out to make room for the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> was not till a long time after.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly Note;
<q>Times of trouble are ſpecially known to, and appointed by God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>As he reſerves his ſtores of vengeance for thoſe times, ſo he knows thoſe times. Wiſe Princes reſerve ſtores againſt that evil time of war, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet when that evil time will be they know not: but to God all times are known. <hi>David</hi> ſaid (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.15.) <hi>My times are in thy hand,</hi> that is, my times of peace and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:48669:102"/> of joy and ſorrow, are at thy diſpoſe; thou cutteſt out my times, not onely as to the length or ſhortneſs of them, but as to the form and condition of them. Now if the Lord diſpoſeth and ordereth our times, what they ſhall be, whether troublous or proſperous, then he muſt needs know what times will be times of trouble.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly Note;
<q>Preſent impunity is no aſſurance of future indemnity to ſinners.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Judgement is but reſerved, and the inſtruments of it, <hi>ſnow and hail, &amp;c.</hi> kept up for a while. Prodigals and ſpend-thrifts may boaſt, but the date of the bond will come out, and then an arreſt comes. Let ſinners remember, the inſtruments of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine vengeance are only reſerved, they are not broken nor caſt away; and whoſoever are found in ſin, <hi>their ſin</hi> (that is the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of their ſin) ſooner or later <hi>will find them out</hi> (Numb. 32.23.) As God ſometimes defers to give out mercy to his faithful people, but never denies it them; ſo he often defers the trouble of the wicked, but never (they continuing to do wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly) acquits them from it. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> propheſying of <hi>falſe teachers, who ſhall bring in damnable hereſies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and ſhall bring upon themſelves ſwift deſtruction</hi> (2 Pet. 2.1.) ſaith of them alſo (<hi>v.</hi> 3.) <hi>Whoſe judgement now of a long time lingreth not, and their damnation ſlumbreth not.</hi> Though all ſeems to be well with them at preſent, and h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>th been ſo a long time, yet their miſery is certain; it nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lingers nor ſlumbers, as to the Lords time, though it may ſeem to have done both, in theirs. The wicked, how long ſoever they eſcape judgement, are not preſerved from it, but onely reſerved to it, as followeth in the fourth and ninth verſe of that Chapter. As the fallen angels are <hi>reſerved in everlaſting chains of darkneſs,</hi> (that is, in chains that will hold them faſt enough for ever) <hi>unto the Judgement of the Great Day,</hi> or to the Great Day of Judgement: Which intimates two things concerning the fallen Angels.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That their torments are not yet at the greateſt, nor their ſufferings at the higheſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That their puniſhment is unavoidable, for they can never break nor file off thoſe chains. (As I ſay the fallen Angels
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:48669:102"/> are ſaid to be reſerved to judgement in chains of darkneſs, at the ſixth verſe of the Epiſtle of <hi>Jude;</hi> ſo at the 13th verſe of the ſame Epiſtle it is ſaid that to ſeducers and falſe teachers (who cauſe many to fall) <hi>The blackneſs of dareneſs is reſerved for ever;</hi> they have it not, but 'tis reſerved for them. Their preſent impunity is no aſſurance of their future indemnity.</p>
                  <p>From the latter part of the verſe, where the time of trouble is called, <hi>The day of battel and war,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Obſerve, Firſt;
<q>Obſtinate and impenitent ſinners make war (in a manner) with God himſelf.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though they ſend not a Herald formally to defie him, yet a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved progreſs in ſin (let God ſay what he will, and do what he will) is a real defiance of him, or a bidding him do his worſt.<note place="margin">Gigantes <gap reason="foreign">

Did not men make a war upon God by doing evil, God would never make war up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, by ſending evil. Men are vain when they fall into ſin, but they are worſe than vanity, when they ſtand out in ſinning. <hi>Who</hi> (ſaith the Lord, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.4.) <hi>would ſet briars and thorns a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me in battel</hi> (none but a mad-man will) <hi>I would go thorow,</hi> or (as the Margin hath it) <hi>march againſt them, I would burn them together.</hi> Can briars and thorns abide contending with God, who is <hi>a conſuming fire?</hi> If God ſend forth an army of his meaneſt and moſt contemptible ſouldiers, flies from the air, lice from the earth, even a mighty <hi>Pharaoh</hi> muſt call for a treaty, and beg a parly. If he command ſnow and hail, much more lightning and thunder out of the clouds to fight againſt his enemies, how ſoon are they overwhelmed and confounded! 'Tis beſt therefore never to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin this war, and the next beſt is, ſpeedily to ſue for peace.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Obſerve;
<q>A day of battel and war is eminently a time of trouble.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>There may be trouble where there is no war, but where war is, there cannot but be trouble. War or the ſword, is not onely one of thoſe four ſore judgements, but the firſt of the four, with
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:48669:103"/> which God threatned <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to the cutting off or utter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of man and beaſt (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 14.8.) <hi>Every battel of the warrier is with c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Confuſed noiſes are the muſick of a battel, and bloody garments the bravery of it; then prize peace, pray for peace, <hi>That</hi> (as the Apoſtle directs, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.16.) <hi>The Lord of Peace himſelf would give us peace alwayes by all means.</hi> For though that may be doubted and queried, which ſome have fully aſſerted, That the moſt unequal peace is to be preferred before the juſteſt war; yet the juſteſt war may bring, though peace and honour at laſt, yet in the mean time innumerable troubles and evils with it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Note;
<q>God can make any creature hurtful and afflictive to us.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Snow is of great uſe, and ſerves much to advance the fruttful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the earth, and is joyned with rain in that effect, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.10.) <hi>As the rain cometh down, and the ſnow from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it bring forth and bud,</hi> &amp;c. (by the concurrent bleſſing of God) <hi>So, &amp;c.</hi> Snow as well as rain is a bleſſing to the earth, not an affliction; yea ſnow is uſed by ſome as a delicacy to cool their drink in hot Countries and ſeaſons; which uſe of it was firſt found out by that monſter of men <hi>Nero,</hi> ſaith <hi>Pliny,</hi> who thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims and p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

He can afflict us, not onely with ſtrong and ſtormy winds, not onely with dreadful thunder and lightning, but with ſnow, which is ſoft as wool, and hail-ſtones, which uſually children ſport and play with. He hath deſtroyed ſinners not onely by lions and bears, and ſuch like ravenous beaſts, but with frogs and mice, with lice and locuſts, as was toucht before. There are two things which ſhew the mighty power of God in the Creature.</p>
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:48669:103"/>
                  <p>Firſt, That he can make the moſt devouring and deſtructive creatures harmleſs and hurtleſs to us. Thus he ſtopt the fiery furnace from ſo much as cinging a hair, or impreſſing the leaſt ſmell of burning upon thoſe three worthies (<hi>Dan.</hi> 3.27.) He alſo ſhut the mouths of thoſe hungry Lions, not onely from tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and totally devouring, but from touching <hi>Daniel</hi> to hurt him (<hi>chap.</hi> 6.22.)</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That he can make the moſt harmleſs and hurtleſs creatures to hurt us. How powerful is God, who can cruſh the ſtrongeſt man on earth by the weakeſt of his creatures! There was much of God in it, that ſome of his people of old, <hi>through faith, out of weakneſs were made ſtrong, waxed valiant</hi> (being 'tis like before, of a fearful ſpirit) <hi>in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens</hi> (Heb. 11.33, 34.) And is there not much of God in it, when any ſort of creatures weak, and inconſiderable in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, are armed by him to conflict with and get the victory o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his ſtrongeſt and proudeſt enemies!</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Note;
<q>God can make a time of trouble terrible.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He hath a reſerve of ſnow and hail in his treaſury againſt the time of trouble, againſt the day of battel and war. As God can make a day of trouble comfortable to his ſervants; he can be <hi>a hiding place from the wind, and a covert from the tempeſt; as ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of water in a dry place, and as the ſhadow of a great rock in a weary land</hi> (Iſa. 32.2.) All which metaphors ſignifie one and the ſame thing, that Chriſt will be comfortable to his people ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther immediately or by proviſion of means in the moſt trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome times, there intended by wind and tempeſt, by a dry place and a weary land. And that he had been all this to his in ſuch a day, the ſame prophet aſſures us (<hi>chap.</hi> 25.4.) <hi>Thou haſt been a ſtrength to the poor, a ſtrength to the needy in his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, a refuge from the ſtorm, a ſhadow from the heat, when the blaſt of the terrible ones is as a ſtorm againſt the wall.</hi> The Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of the taking of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> ſet down by <hi>Jeremy,</hi> tells us, that he was fully heard and anſwered, when he p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ayed (<hi>chap.</hi> 17.17.) <hi>Be not thou a terror to me: thou art my hope in the day of evil. Jeremy</hi> found the Lord very favourable to him, and giving him favour in the eyes of the enemy, when
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:48669:104"/> that evil day, the day of battel and war came upon <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Thus ſometimes God <hi>ſtayeth his rough wind in the day of the Eaſt-wind</hi> (Iſa. 27.8.) that is, he forbeareth to ſhew himſelf rough, harſh or grievous to his people, when great troubles are otherwiſe upon them, noted by the Eaſt-wind, which natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is a blaſting, bluſtring, and boiſterous wind; and therefore a day of great trouble is elegantly expreſſed or called, <hi>a day of the Eaſt-wind.</hi> When the Pſalmiſt had deſcribed the fained hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliations of the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Wilderneſs, which he calls their <hi>flattering God with their lips, and lying unto him with their tongues;</hi> This was enough to provoke God to make their day of trouble terrible to them, yet (ſaith that Scripture) <hi>He being full of compaſſion, forgave their iniquity, and deſtroyed them not; yea many a time turned he his anger away, and did not ſtir up all his wrath</hi> (Pſal. 78.38.) Though they all ſtirred him to wrath, yet he did not ſtir up all his wrath (when it was worſt with them) that would have made it a terrible day indeed. This is the Lords way with his people in an evil day.</p>
                  <p>But when it is a day of battel and war with the wicked world, or with the wicked of the world, he opens his treaſures of wrath, and will let them ſee and feel what ſtores of ſnow and hail he hath reſerved againſt that time. And hence it is, that ſuch are repreſented in the day of the Lord, <hi>going into the clifts of the rocks and into the tops of the ragged rocks for fear of the Lord, and for the glory of his Majeſty, when he ariſeth to ſhake terribly the earth</hi> (Iſa. 3.21.)</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Note;
<q>Snow and hail are Gods weapons and artillery, with which he ſometimes fights againſt ſinful man.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Lord of Hoſts hath ſuch inſtruments of war in his Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as no Prince can produce nor make uſe of, either to offend his enemies, or to defend himſelf.

                     </note> It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by <hi>Joſephus,</hi> deſcribing this battel, that as ſoon as the armies joyned battel, God ſent a violent ſhower of hail, which (ſay ſome) being naturally cauſed by the influences of the ſtars or heavenly bodies, the ſtars may be ſaid to have fought in their courſes, like ſouldiers drawn up <hi>in battalia</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Siſera</hi> and his army. And thus by great thunder the Lord diſcomfited the hoſt of the <hi>Philiſtins</hi> in the days of <hi>Samuel,</hi> (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.10.) The prophet gives out ſeveral threatnings under the notion of hail (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.17. <hi>chap.</hi> 30.30.) and ſo doth that laſt propheſie (<hi>Rev.</hi> 16.21.) <hi>And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every ſtone about the weight of a talent.</hi> All

                  <p>So then, ſometimes God doth, as it were, pitch his Military Tent or R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

God uſeth the clouds both as his ſhield to protect his people (<hi>Exod.</hi> 14.19.) and as his bow to ſhoot at and wound the wicked.<note place="margin">— <hi>Armamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria Coeli.</hi> Juven. Satyr. 16.</note> From thence (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 11.6.) <hi>He rains upon the wicked, ſnares, fire and brimſtone, and an horrible tempeſt: this ſhall be the portion of their cup;</hi> That is, they ſhall have nothing elſe in their cup to drink but this, and of this they ſhall drink deep, even <hi>the very dregs, and wring them out</hi> (Pſal. 75.8.) A heathen Poet called the Clouds the Armories or Arcenals of Heaven; and the Scripture, both in this Text of <hi>Job,</hi> and in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other places, beſides thoſe which have been mentioned, ſheweth what Ammunition, what inſtruments of the Lords fierce anger and fiery indignation are ſtored, laid up, or reſerved there <hi>againſt the time of trouble, againſt the day of battel and war</hi> with the rebellious world.</p>
                  <p>Now, Foraſmuch as ſnow and hail, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are at once the Lords Hoſt and his Arms, by which he fights againſt the wicked, we may take notice of theſe five following inferences for the help of our meditations about this matter, and to make all that hath been already held forth from theſe two verſes, more profitable to us.</p>
                  <p>Firſt,
<q>God needeth not borrow help from man on earth, when he would be avenged on his enemies.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>If he doth but ſpeak the word and declare his will, it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; The heavens, the clouds of heaven will b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ing him Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and Arms without number. He that covers the earth a foot deep with ſnow, can cover all (as we ſay) over head and ears with it. He that powres down ſhowres of hail, no bigger than a peaſe, can ſend it of a talent weight, as 'tis expreſſed, (<hi>Rev.</hi> 16.21.) God cannot want Armies at any time, for his
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:48669:105"/> day of battel and war, who can make any thing ſerve him effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively as an Army; and therefore they who being in diſtreſs ſee no more help in man, than <hi>David,</hi> when he ſaid (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 142.4.) <hi>I looked on my right hand, and beheld, but there was no man that would know me</hi> (how well ſoever I was known to him) <hi>refuge failed me, there was no man that cared for my ſoul;</hi> that is, that regarded what became of me: I was left at ſix and ſevens, to ſink or ſwim, to ſhift for my ſelf as well as I could: they, I ſay, who are thus diſtreſſed, having an intereſt in God, need not deſpair nor deſpond, ſeeing the Lord can charge or preſs any creature for our aid and help, yea can help us without the aid of any creature.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,
<q>Take heed of provoking God, who hath ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ch Armes and Armies alwayes at command.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis dangerous medling wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h a prepared enemy. God can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>priſed not taken unprovided. As <hi>the wicked bend their bow, and make ready their arrow upon the ſtring, that they may privily ſhoot at the upright in heart</hi> (Pſal. 11.2.) So the Lord hath his bow alwayes bent, and his arrow made ready upon the ſtring, openly to ſhoot at the falſe in heart. Though it be uſually long before he takes revenge, yet 'tis not becauſe he is unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and cannot, but becauſe patient, and will not take it ſooner. He is alwayes able to avenge himſelf, not onely ſpeedily, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently. As he will do what he hath ſpoken, ſo he can do what he will with a word ſpeaking.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,
<q>Would we not fear ſnow or hail, or any miſſive weapon of heaven, then let us get God to be our friend, in whoſe hand, and at whoſe command they are.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>No creature moves but by direction from God; and ſurely he will never direct them to the hurt, though often to the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and correction of thoſe whom he loves. As ſuch are in league with the ſtones of the field, and the beaſts of the field are at peace with them; ſo alſo are the ſtars of heaven, and all the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teors (ſnow and hail, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) in the air.</p>
                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:48669:106"/>
                  <p>Fourthly,
<q>God will charge them with hardneſs of heart and impenitency, who humble not themſelves when he fights againſt them with theſe weapons.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Every judiciary ſhower of hail, though it break not our heads, yet it ſhould break our hearts. That hail which doth any hurt to the works of our hands, ſhould work good upon our hearts. And therefore the Lord complained when his hail-ſtones left no more ſign or impreſſion upon his peoples hearts than they did upon a rock or ſtone (<hi>Hag.</hi> 2.17.) <hi>I ſmote you with bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting and with mildew, and with hail, in all your labours, yet ye turned not to me, ſaith the Lord.</hi> This Scripture teacheth us two uſeful leſſons,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, When God ſmites any thing that is ours, or belongs to us, he ſmites us. If our fields or gardens be ſmitten, we are ſmitten.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, God expects we ſhould, and even wonders, if we do not turn upon ſuch ſmitings. He looks upon them as hardned ſinners, who melt not by every afflictive fall of hail from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. They are even reſolved to be bad, who mind not being good or better, when evils fall upon either them or theirs.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly,
<q>Haſten to make peace with God, when he gives ſigns and ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rums of war.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>God had no ſooner ſaid to <hi>Iſrael</hi> (Amos 4.12.) <hi>Therefore,</hi> (that is, becauſe thou haſt not taken the alarum by former judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, therefore) <hi>thus will I do unto thee, O Iſrael</hi> (that is, I will bring ſome ſorer judgement upon thee than any of thoſe already brought) but he adds, <hi>and becauſe I will do this unto thee</hi> (unleſs prevented by ſpeedy repentance) <hi>prepare to meet thy God, O Iſrael.</hi> As if God had ſaid, Conſider (as Chriſt adviſeth on another occaſion, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.31.) whether thou art able with thy ten thouſand to meet me with my twenty thouſand (all the power of man is not onely leſs by half, as ten thouſand to twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, but indeed nothing at all to the power of God) and if not, as I know thou art not, then I counſel thee, while I onely tell
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:48669:106"/> thee <hi>I will do thus unto thee,</hi> but am yet a great way off (poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly) from coming to do it, prepare to meet me, ſend an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſage of prayers and tears, and deſire conditions of peace. It will be too late to call for a compoſition, or to think of a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, when the trumpets have ſounded, and the battel is joyned. If we get not (through Chriſt) our peace made before the day of battel and war in this world, I mean before temporal judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e actually come upon us, and have taken hold of us, we may ſmart ſoundly before we have our peace, and pay dearly for it, before we have it: But if we prepare not to meet God, and get our peace made through Chriſt, before the day of battel and war in the next world, I mean before Death and the Eternal Judgement come upon us, we ſhall not onely ſmart ſoundly and pay dearly for that wretched neglect of our ſeaſon, but muſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh for ever, under an impoſſibility of having our peace made. The Day of Gods battel and war with the wicked in the next world, is Eternity. Here in this world God ſaith to the worſt of ſinners, to him that is but briars and thorns (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.5.) <hi>Let him take hold of my ſtrength</hi> (that is, of my Grace, or of my Son, which are my ſtrength to ſave ſinners) <hi>that he may make peace with me, and</hi> (I aſſure him his aſſay ſhall not be in vain) <hi>he ſhall make peace with me:</hi> I am no inexorable God, yea, I am eaſie to be intreated, if treated with, when, and in whom, and in ſuch a way as I have offered my ſelf to ſinners, to be treated with for peace. But if any think to make peace with God in any other way than faith and repentance, by any other perſon than Chriſt Jeſus, at any other time than the time of this life, we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive another Goſpel, before we can give them any (aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance ſhall I ſay, or) the leaſt ſhadow of a hope that they ſhall do ſo.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, As there is a new proportion of the light provided e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day; for, as it was ſhewed before, we never have the light two days together in the ſame ſtate, but more or leſs, ſhorter or longer.

                  <p>The light is a moſt ſweet, pleaſant creature to behold, and the Lord takes the guidance of it into his own hand, he parts it, he proportions it out as himſelf pleaſeth. And as this is true of ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial light, ſo of a better light than that which ſhines in the air, (though that be an excellent light) the light of the Goſpel. The work of God is as wonderful, I may ſay, much more won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful in parting and dividing, in diſtributing and proportioning the light of the Goſpel, than it is in diſtributing and giving forth the light of the Sun. Doth he not at the ſame time cauſe that light to ſhine upon one place, while it is darkneſs in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? As he made aereal darkneſs to be a plague in the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> while it was light in <hi>Goſhen,</hi> ſo he leaves many places under ſpiritual darkneſs, while others enjoy that bleſſed light, in
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:48669:108"/> a clear and conſtant ſhining. And as the <hi>Egyptians</hi> with all their learning, could not tell the way how God parted the light then, that it ſhould be light in <hi>Goſhen,</hi> and darkneſs to feeling, or dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that might be felt in all the other parts of <hi>Egypt;</hi> ſo who can give a reaſon of that diſtribution of Goſpel light which God makes to ſome parts of the world, while other parts of it ſit in darkneſs and in the very ſhadow of death?</p>

The winds are of a moſt diffuſive nature, they ſcatter themſelves, they diſperſe, and paſs through the air with much violence and vehemence. But I ſhall not ſtay upon that. The main ſcope and purpoſe of the Lord in putting this queſtion, being onely this, To ſhew, that as the light (take it either for the lightning, or for the light of the Sun) is in the hands of God; ſo alſo, that the wind, even the Eaſt-wind, is at his diſpoſe too.</p>
                  <p>Hence Note;

                  <p>He who commands the light, commands the winds (<hi>Prov.</hi> 30.4.) <hi>He gathereth the winds in his fiſt,</hi> he comprehends them all in his hand. 'Ts a wonderful expreſſion of the power of God, that he hath the looſe winds as faſt as a man hath that which he gripes in his fiſt, and 'tis at the opening of his hand that they paſs forth. Whatever natural cauſes there are of the winds, we muſt look beyond them all, at the power of God, as the cauſe reigning over all other cauſes. Chriſt (<hi>John</hi> 3.) treating with

                  <p>There are four things wherein the Lords Empire and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty over theſe waters doth and may appear. The Lord orders the courſe of theſe waters,</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The Lord ſpeaks here of a ſpecial place, to which he deſigns the Rain: where ſhould that be? Surely the paſtures, and till'd grounds, gardens, and vineyards, places cultivated and inhabited by men; the Lord hath Rain for them, yet not all for them, or not for them all: Here the <hi>Cargo</hi> or lading of the clouds is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to places uninhabited by man; <hi>He cauſeth it to rain on the earth where no man is.</hi> Some Parts of the earth are full of men, well inhabited; there are other parts of the earth which are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inhabited, or where no man is. This Text tells us, there is an earth where no man is. Travellers and Navigators have found ſome Parts of the earth which were counted uninhabitable, not only habitable, but actually inhabited by many people. Yet there may be ſome Parts of the earth habitable in their own nature, wherein no man dwells, or in which (as the Text ſpeaks) <hi>no man is.</hi> Yea poſſibly there are ſome Parts of the earth uninhabitable, or wherein no man can dwel. Now is it not ſtrange that the Lord ſhould carry his rain to ſuch parts of the earth, to places where no man is? where there are neither Cities, nor Towns, nor Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages, no nor the meaneſt Cottages, nor a man breathing on the face of that earth? <hi>or that,</hi> as the latter part of the verſe ſpeaks, (which is but an explication of the ſame thing) <hi>he ſhould cauſe it to rain on the Wilderneſs, where there is no man?</hi> If we would know what the Lord intends by earth where no man is, the Text anſwers, <hi>The Wilderneſs where there is no man,</hi> or, <hi>where none of Adam dwelleth,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi> tranſlates. So then this latter clauſe of the verſe is but a repetition of the ſame thing, yet a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition made not onely for variety and elegancy, but alſo to
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:48669:112"/> ſignifie the certainty of the thing, that God gives rain even to ſuch places where no man is. There is a very elegant turn of the words in this verſe. The former part ſaith, <hi>To cauſe it to rain on the earth where no man is;</hi> the latter ſaith, <hi>On the wilderneſſe where there is no man.</hi> There are ſome wilderneſſes which are inhabited, and therefore God tells us diſtinctly what wilderneſs he means.</p>
                  <p>There are two ſorts of wilderneſſes:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Such as are inhabited. <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> went and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a wilderneſſe; there were Towns and many Dwellings in that wilderneſs.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There are alſo wilderneſſes uninhabited.<note place="margin">

The Hebrew Word which ſignifies a Wilderneſſe, ſignifieth alſo the Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and ſo ſome tranſlate here, <hi>In peſtilent places, or in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>healthy places,</hi> in places untilled or unmanured, becauſe of the unhealthfulneſſe of them, even in theſe wilderneſſes the Lord ſends rain.</p>
                  <p>Again, Others conceive the wilderneſs here ſtands in direct oppoſition to <hi>Egypt,</hi> and that the Lord would intimate, that as <hi>Egypt</hi> was abundantly watered by the river <hi>Nilus,</hi> they making ſluces from that river (as hath been ſomewhere noted in this Book) to draw the water all the Country over; for <hi>Egypt</hi> is a flat Country, not a Country of Mountains or Hills. Now ſaith the Lord, even as <hi>Egypt</hi> by the drawing of Water-courſes, is made fruitful, and abundantly ſupplied with moiſture, though no rain falls there; ſo I will water the Wilderneſs with rain from the clouds, as well as they water <hi>Egypt,</hi>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>poſe is that, yet the Lord will water ſuch places (as it were) by his own hand, and (as 'tis ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107.35.) <hi>Turn the wilderneſs into ſtanding water, and dry ground into Water-ſprings.</hi> Though there be no man to eat the fruit, which the rain produceth from the earth (of which the Text ſpeaks after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward) yet God will ſend rain to make that land fruitful, for the beaſts ſake, that they may have graſs and green things to feed upon. God will provide for the beaſts of the earth, where there are no men to provide for them, nor to be provided for. <hi>God is a great Houſe-keeper:</hi> He nouriſheth all living creatures as well as men, as he preſerves, ſo he feeds the beaſts of the
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:48669:113"/> Earth, and the fiſhes of the Sea, as well as men (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.27.) <hi>Theſe all wait upon thee (O Lord) that thou maiſt give them their meat in due ſeaſon;</hi> the very fiſhes in the Sea wait upon God for their meat, and ſo do fowls of the air, together with all things moving upon the face of the Earth (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.15.) <hi>The eyes of all wait upon thee, and thou giveſt them meat in due ſeaſon;</hi> and that he may do ſo, he gives them rain in due ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; <hi>He cauſeth it to rain on the Earth where no man is, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the wilderneſſe, where there is no man.</hi> God hath beaſts to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for, where men are not, and he will not let a beaſt that he hath made, want food; the very worms ſhall have a ſupport of life.</p>
                  <p>Hence Chriſt argues away all undue care and thoughtfulneſſe in man for the ſuccours of this life (<hi>Matth.</hi> 6.25, 26.) <hi>Take no thought for your life, what ye ſhall eat, or what ye ſhall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye ſhall put on. Behold, the fowls of the air; for they ſowe not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them: are ye not much better than they?</hi> Surely ye are, therefore ye ſhall be better provided for than they. Hath God a break-faſt ready for every little bird that comes chirping out of her Neſt? Hath he a break-faſt ready for every beaſt in the Wilderneſſe that comes out of his den? and will he not much more provide for you, <hi>O ye of little faith?</hi> How encouraging an argument is this to our Faith, that the Lord will provide for all men, and eſpecially for his own; ſeeing he provides for the fowls of the air, and the beaſts of the earth, where there is no man to give them any food, or take any care of them!</p>
                  <p>This conſideration may ſtrengthen our dependance on God, though we are brought into a Wilderneſs condition, where there is no man to pity us, or give us a morſel of bread. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Lord that feeds the wild beaſts where there is no man, can and will provide for his own people, when the hearts of all men are ſhut up againſt them; he can make the fowls of the air and the beaſts of the earth to bring them food, as the ravens did to <hi>Elijah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Further, This is an inſtance of the inexhauſtible treaſure of the Lords goodneſs: For if he giveth rain in the wilderneſs for the beaſts of the earth, may we not thence infer, ſurely the
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:48669:114"/> Lord will take care even of thoſe who are unworthy. What have the beaſts deſerved at the hand of God, that he ſhould provide for them? Yea, the Lord doth not onely give food to thoſe that are of no deſert, as the beaſts, but to thoſe that are of ill deſert, he gives rain to thoſe who are but beaſts in the ſhape of men, men of beaſtly ſpirits. The Lord feeds the Lions and the Bears, the Tygers and the Swine of the World, that is, men like them; he cauſeth his rain to fall upon the juſt and unjuſt (<hi>Matth.</hi> 5.45.<note place="margin">Satius eſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe malis propter bonos quam bonis <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>This is true alſo in a ſpiritual way; The Lord ſends his rain upon the wilderneſs, he hath done ſo, and he hath promiſed to do ſo ſtill; that is, he hath ſent, and will ſend the rain of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel upon the Heathen.

But how ſhould the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſolitary places attain this glory? That's ſhewed at the ſixth and ſeventh verſes; <hi>for in the wilderneſs ſhall waters break out, and ſtreams in the deſert; and the parched ground ſhall become a pool, and the thirſty land ſprings of water.</hi> This Propheſie contains a promiſe of ſending the Goſpel, and with that the Holy Spirit (who is often compared in Scripture to water) to thoſe who were or are in their ſoul-ſtate as a dry heath, or as a barren wilderneſs. This prophet doth not only hold out a like promiſe in the ſame Metaphors, but explains it thus (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.3, 4, 5.) <hi>I will pour water upon him that is thirſty, and floods upon the dry ground;</hi> what is meant by water and floods we may learn from the next words; <hi>I will pour my ſpirit upon thy ſeed, and my bleſſing upon

                     </note> That he <hi>may fill the deſolate and waſt ground;</hi> that which is filled, is or ſhould be ſatisfied. <hi>To be full of dayes,</hi> in Scripture, is to be ſatisfied with living. A man may have lived many dayes, yet not be full of dayes; but he who is full of dayes (as 'tis ſaid of ſome of the Patriarchs) is not hungry after more time or dayes in this world; therefore
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:48669:115"/> to be filled and ſatisfied, import the ſame thing. And to be ſure they who are not ſatisfied when they are full, will not be ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when they are empty. But however it is with man, we know the earth ſpoken of in the Text is fully ſatisfied; it gapes for no more, when 'tis filled with rain. And this the Lord will ſend, <hi>To ſatisfie the deſolate and waſt ground.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But why is the Lord ſo careful <hi>to ſatisfie the deſolate and waſt ground?</hi> The ground is a ſenſeleſſe thing, that feels not the want of rain. I anſwer, The Lord doth not ſatisfie the ground for the grounds ſake, but for their ſake who live upon, and are maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ground. Fruit-bearing trees and graſs are maintained by the moiſture and fatneſſe of the ground; beaſts are maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by thoſe fruits and graſſe: therefore the Lord ſatisfies the ground with rain, that it may ſatisfie the trees and graſſe, and they the beaſts that live upon it. So then the Lord ſatisfieth the ground, that it may ſatisfie all ſorts of vegetables growing out of the ground, and that they may ſatisfie all kinds of animals living upon the ground. Such a gradation we find (<hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.21, 22.) <hi>I will hear, ſaith the Lord, I will hear the heavens, and they ſhall hear the earth, and the earth ſhall hear the corn, and the wine, and the oil, and they ſhall hear Jezrael,</hi> that is, my people. We may run up the meaning of this promiſe backwards, thus, When my people (whom I now call <hi>Jezrael</hi> in a way of promiſe, as in a way of threatning, <hi>chap.</hi> 1.4.) being preſſed with hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and famine, cry to the corn, and the wine, and the oil, for food, they ſhall hear them; and when the corn and wine call to the earth for moiſture to feed them, that ſhall hear; and when the earth calls to the heavens for rain, they ſhall hear; and when the heavens call to God for orders to carry rain, he will hear them. It is for mans uſe that God makes the earth fruitful; and where there are no men, 'tis for the beaſts ſake, that he ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>the deſolate and waſt ground.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence Note, Firſt,
<q>God is not wanting to any of his creatures, according to their ſtate.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He will not let the ſenſeleſs ground ſuffer hunger and thirſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlong, that ſhall have food after its kind, or proper for it.</p>
                  <pb n="213" facs="tcp:48669:115"/>
                  <p>Secondly, Note;
<q>Even the Earth knows when it hath enough.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is ſatisfied. And this may be a great reproof upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatiableneſs of many men; they in this are much worſe than the deſolate and waſt ground, that may be ſatisfied, that will crave no more. But whereas <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, there are <hi>four things that ſay not it is enough</hi> (Prov. 30.15, 16.) Of all things, the deſires of man are moſt unſatiable, and <hi>ſay not it is enough.</hi> It was a great word which <hi>Eſau</hi> ſpake, <hi>I have enough my brother</hi> (Gen. 33.9.) and I fear he hath but a few brethren in that ſaying. Among the four things which in <hi>Solomons</hi> ob ervation <hi>ſay not it is enough,</hi> the earth is one, in the place laſt mentioned. But mark, It is the earth, <hi>that is not filled with water.</hi> For where God is pleaſed to fill the earth with water, then as this Text in <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks, it is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied. <hi>He cauſeth it to rain on the wilderneſs, to ſatisfie the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate and waſt ground.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Further, This may alſo comfort us in all our wants. For doubtleſs the Lord who takes care to ſatisfie the ſenſeleſs ground, will ſatisfie his believing people early with his mercy (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.14.) when they cry to him; yea he will ſatisfie them not onely with good in this life, but <hi>with long life will he ſatisfie them, and ſhew them his ſalvation</hi> (Pſal. 91.16.) <hi>He will abundantly bleſſe Sions proviſion</hi> (What is that? The Word and Ordinances chiefly) <hi>and ſatisfie her poor with bread;</hi> with the <hi>bread of life</hi> eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, God ſends rain <hi>to ſatisfie the deſolate and waſt ground.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence Note;
<q>God hath rain enough for all places.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He can ſpare it for <hi>waſte ground and wilderneſſes.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if he ſupplieth not our paſtures, corn-fields, and gardens with rain, it is not becauſe he cannot ſend it, or hath not enough to ſend, but it is to puniſh us for ſin. God doth not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold rain from any place, becauſe he is ſparing of his treaſures, is more for laying them up than giving them out; but becauſe he is provoked by the unthankfulneſs of man, for, or by his abuſe of his former bounties. The Lord forbids the clouds to drop down the rain upon inhabited places, and bids them convey it to waſte
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:48669:116"/> wilderneſſes, when inhabited places have not honoured him for it, nor brought forth fruits of righteouſneſs anſwerable to the fruits of the earth by the bleſſing of rain.</p>
                  <p>Thus alſo Chriſt will take the kingdome, that is, the kingdome of the Goſpel, the rain of holy doctrine, from an unthankful and unfruitful people, and give it to a Nation that will bring forth the fruits of it, as he threatned the Jewes (<hi>Matth.</hi> 21.43.) and afterwards fulfilled that threatning upon them (<hi>Acts</hi> 13.46.) <hi>Lo we turn to the Gentiles.</hi> Ye having refuſed and abuſed the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers of Chriſt made to you by us; we will now go with our rain to the waſt and deſolate ground, or to the wilderneſs; that is, to the Gentiles, and they will receive it, and be thankful. The ſcarcity of Goſpel mercy which God brings upon any place,<note place="margin">Sic ſterilitas agrorum divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae &amp; fertili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas eſt deſerti.</note> is a puniſhment of their barrenneſs under Goſpel means. And have not we cauſe to fear at this day, that foraſmuch as we are ſo like that earth ſpoken of (<hi>Heb.</hi> 6.8.) which drinketh in the rain, yet (inſtead of fruit meet for his uſe by whom it is dreſſed) beareth briars and thorns; have not we cauſe I ſay to fear) that we are nigh to ſome curſe and burning, or that the Lord will car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry away the rain to Heathens, who as yet are <hi>a deſolate and waſte ground.</hi>

                  <p>Hence Note;
<q>Natural cauſes produce proper natural effects.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>When God ſends rain on deſolate places, they bud and ſpring forth. When the rain falls, the herb flouriſhes; where the Sun ſhines, the graſſe grows. And ſurely thus it is in ſpirituals, ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual cauſes bring forth ſpiritual effects; if the Lord ſends the rain of the word upon deſolate ſouls, the ſoul receiving it will bud, and the tender herb will bring forth. <hi>Moſes (Deut.</hi> 32.1, 2.) compared his <hi>Doctrine to the ſmall rain upon the tender herb, and to the ſhowres upon the graſſe.</hi> How green are the herbs after
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:48669:116"/> rain, and the graſſe after ſhowres! Herbs and graſſe bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the bounty and goodneſs of God, in giving ſweet ſhowres of rain: Natural rain is ſeen in their looks, and ſo ſhould ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual in our lives. And if, where the rain of the word falleth, they that receive it, do not bud and bloſſome and bring forth fruit, the deſolate wilderneſs will riſe up in judgement againſt them, the waſte grounds will condemn them. They will ſay, Lord, you ſent rain upon us, and lo, here are our buds and our bloſſomes, yea, here's the fruit which we have brought forth. Will not this ſhame our barrenneſs? Hath the Lord divided the Water-courſe of the Goſpel, and cauſed it to rain on us from day to day, and ſhall not we ſhew our buds and bloſſomes of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, our fruits of faith and repentance, that he may come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his garden, and eat of his pleaſant fruits! How dreadful! Shall the waſte wilderneſſes and deſolate grounds bring forth, when the rain f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lls upon them, and ſhall not the Church! It is not bare profeſſing, but fruit-bearing, which honours God (<hi>John</hi> 15.8.) It is uncomely if ſo much as a leaf of profeſſion wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.3.) But how green ſoever the leaves of our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion are, yea, though they ſhould retain their greenneſs under the hotteſt and moſt ſcorching Sun of Perſecution, yet what would it advantage us, if our leaves are not accompanied with good fruits.</p>
                  <p>Now, If any ſhould ask, What mean you by good fruits? Or what fruits are good? I ſhall cloſe the point in hand with an Anſwer to theſe Queſtions.</p>
                  <p>Theſe good fruits conſidered in reference to their efficient cauſe, are called <hi>fruits of the ſpirit</hi> (Gal. 5.22.) and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the matter of them, they are called <hi>fruits of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi> (Phil. 1.11.) but in reference to the beginning or occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them, they are called <hi>fruits meet for repentance</hi> (Matth. 3.8.) In general, all that <hi>is good fruit,</hi> which is conformable to the Word of God; whether it be the conformity of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to it, in converſion; or the conformity of our wayes to it, in our daily converſation.</p>
                  <p>More particularly, theſe good fruits are of two ſorts:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Inward fruits, or thoſe which we bring forth within, that is, in our hearts; theſe are ſecrets, and only known to God.</p>
                  <pb n="216" facs="tcp:48669:117"/>
                  <p>Secondly, Outward fruits, which we bring forth in our lives; theſe are or may be ſeen of men; yet they muſt not be brought forth, that we may be ſeen in doing them, but, <hi>that men ſeeing our good works, may glorifie our Father which is in Heaven</hi> (Matth. 5.16.)</p>
                  <p>Our inward good fruits (which are indeed our choiceſt and moſt ſpiritual good fruits) are of three ſorts.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Good Thoughts.</hi> To do good is beſt for others; but to think good, or to have many good thoughts, is the beſt proof, that we our ſelves are good. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith (<hi>Prov.</hi> 12.12.) <hi>The root of the righteous yieldeth fruit.</hi> The root of a righteous man is his heart, and the firſt-fruits of a good heart are good thoughts. He is a precious perſon, and hath a precious heart, that can ſay as holy <hi>David</hi> did (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.17.) <hi>How precious are thy thoughts unto me, O God, how great is the ſum of them!</hi> That is, the thoughts which I have of thee O God, are exceeding precious unto me; and I have many, very many of them, more than I am able to ſum or reckon up.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Good affections are good inward fruits, ſuch are godly ſorrow, joy in God, love to God, longing after God (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.4. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.1, 2. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.9.) hatred of evil; all theſe mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the heart, are good and precious fruits.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly (which are the iſſue and reſult of both the former) good purpoſes and holy reſolves to cleave faſt to God, to ſtick (as <hi>David</hi> expreſſeth it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.31.) to his teſtimonies, wayes, and truths, at all times, eſpecially in times of trial; or to continue with Chriſt in his temptation: theſe are very good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward fruits (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.3. <hi>Dan.</hi> 1.8. <hi>Acts</hi> 11.23.)</p>
                  <p>Outward good fruits are of two ſorts:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Good words are good fruits. <hi>The lips of the righteous feed many</hi> (Prov. 10.21.) <hi>Edifying words</hi> (Eph. 4.29.) words of exhortation to good (<hi>Heb.</hi> 3.13.) words of reproof as to evil, (<hi>Gal.</hi> 6.1.) words of comfort to the ſad and ſorrowful (1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.14.) all theſe words are good fruits.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Good works, firſt, of holineſs towards God, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, of righteouſneſs and love towards all men, thirdly, of charity to the poor; all theſe are outward good fruits; and all theſe the Lord looks for, where-ever, or upon whomſoever he ſends the rain of his word.</p>

                  <p>The Inquiry is, who is the <hi>Father of the Rain?</hi> that is, who is the Author? what is the cauſe of it? Not as if the cau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e of that or of the other Meteors here mentioned could not at all be known; but to ſhew,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That much of them all is unknown. There are many things in this lower Sphear beyond mans Sphear; even theſe are not propagated altogether according to our underſtanding or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, To ſhew that he muſt be plentifully ſtored with all ſorts of good, who as a Father begets, and as a Mother brings forth ſuch uſeful and neceſſary things, for the preſervation of liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Creatures.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, To ſhew that theſe creatures are not produced by cauſes which are conſtant and unvariable in nature, but proceed from and daily depend upon the power and will of God, who ſomtimes checks and ſtops the courſe of Nature, and at other
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:48669:118"/> times impregnates it for the production of theſe effects, or brings them forth by the Midwifery and help of ſecond cauſes.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, When the Lord propounds the Queſtion under this Relation of a Father, he would ſhew or teach us that he gives Rain, and Dew to the earth, as a father gives food and other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſites to his children.</p>
                  <p>Further, This ſeems to be the deſign of God in putting theſe Queſtions to <hi>Job,</hi> that foraſmuch as he could not fully compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the cauſation and production of theſe things, much leſs was able to cauſe or produce them himſelf, but muſt receive them from the power and according to the diſpoſe and providence of God; therefore he ſhould refer all his concernments to the ſame Providence, and ſo reſt ſatisfied whether God ſent him a ſweet and refreſhing Rain and Dew, or a grievous and afflictive ſeaſon of Ice and F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Thus we may conceive the general ſcope of this Context. Now to the particulars.</p>
                  <q>Hath the Rain a father?</q>
                  <p>The queſtion may be reſolved both negatively and affirmative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: Firſt, Negatively; the Rain hath no Father, that is, on earth, or among men. There is no creature power that can produce a drop of Rain. Secondly, affi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>matively: <hi>Hath the Rain a father?</hi> Yes, it hath; God is the Father of the Rain. The Rain is not fatherleſs; there is one who will own the Rain as his child, or iſſue. The cauſation of Rain is a great ſecret in nature, a ſecret about which though wiſe and learned men have diſcourſed much, and given out much light about it, yet they have not reached the utmoſt, nor attained the full knowledge of it; and the reaſon of that is, becauſe the Rain hath a Father whoſe wayes and workings as in the firſt conſtitution of Nature, ſo in the daily motions of it, exceed our knowledg.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hath the Rain a father?</hi> Not on earth. Nor are the Heavens the Father of the Rain; the God of Heaven is. As not a ſhower, no nor a drop of Rain falls on the earth at the will or by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of man;<note place="margin">Si quis alium praeter Deum pluviae patrem quaerat, is erit vapor qui ex humidis locis entractus e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> ſo not by the power of the Sun drawing up the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours and diſſolving the Clouds, nor by the Winds ſcattering the Clouds. The Sun may ſhine, the Moon may change, the Winds may blow and turn long enough, yet no Rain till the Lord gives
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:48669:118"/> the Word. Some (and that not improperly) have called the Sun <hi>The father of the Rain.</hi> The Sun draws up thoſe vapours from the earth into the Air, which are the matter of Rain, and there thoſe vapours are condenſed into Clouds, and afterwards rarified and diſſolved into Rain; yet theſe natural cauſes produce theſe effects only as God ſets them on work, and he can ſuſpend their working as often as he will. And therefore the ſimple and plain meaning of this queſtion is, the Rain owes its original to God, <hi>and muſt call him father:</hi> And that's the obſervation which riſeth out of this queſtion, <hi>Hath the Rain a Father?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>God and God alone is the Father of the Rain.</q>
                  <p>Without him it had never been; and that it is continued is by his power and providence; that the frame of nature is ſo diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that ſecond cauſes are ſo ordered and furniſhed as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Rain, proceeds from or comes to paſs by the Lord alone. The Prophet ſpake this in a time of great drought (<hi>Jer.</hi> 14.22.) both in the negative and in the affirmative; and he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed two queſtions, or the queſtion twice, intending the nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. Firſt, <hi>Are there any among the Vanities of the Gentiles that can cauſe Rain?</hi> (By the <hi>vanities of the Gentiles</hi> we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand their <hi>Idol gods.</hi> Idols are <hi>vanities,</hi> or <hi>nothings;</hi> and can they who are nothing do this great thing, give Rain? That's the firſt queſtion, Can Idols cauſe Rain, ſurely they cannot: But will it not rain of courſe? will not the Heavens one time or other yield Rain? That's the ſecond Queſtion) <hi>Can the Heavens give ſhowers?</hi> No, As Idols, or falſe gods, cannot give Rain, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can the Heavens, if forbidden, give Rain; they act not their power in their own power.

                  <p>So then, though there are natural cauſes of Rain, yet God is the firſt cauſe, and it is at his pleaſure that theſe natural cauſes ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

'Tis no ſmall part of our duty to eye God in cauſing theſe common things; and 'tis a great piece of Atheiſm, or a diſowning of God, to tye them up to natural cauſes.</p>
                  <p>Now, If God be the Father of the Rain, we may hence infer,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That <hi>God is the Father of all Creatures, and the ſupream cauſe of all effects in the creatures.</hi> As a Father is the ſecond or inſtrumental cauſe of his Sons Being, ſo God is the ſupream effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cauſe of all Beings and Entities. Not only Animals and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionals, but the very inanimates and ſenſleſs creatures are of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine extraction: God is the Fountain of their Being. And if God be, and muſt be acknowledged as the Father of all Creatures, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of the Rain, then,</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>God is much more the Father of Mankind.</hi> The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle voucheth that to the ſuperſtitious <hi>Athenians</hi> as a Divine truth, out of their own Authors (<hi>Acts</hi> 17.28.) <hi>As certain alſo of your own Poets have ſaid, for we are alſo his off ſpring;</hi> we are ſprung from him as Branches from the Root, or as Streams from the Fountain: Not that we are, as the Streams with the Fountain, or the Branches with the Roo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If God own himſelf as a Father to all things, and to all men, in a general way of Nature, then <hi>much more doth he own himſelf a Father to all his people in a way of grace.</hi> What the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith of his Title <hi>Saviour</hi> (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10.) <hi>He is the Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of all men, eſpecially of thoſe that believe;</hi> ſo I may ſay of this

                     </gap>uits were chief among the fruits of the earth. The firſt born both of man and of beaſt were the Lords portion (<hi>Exod.</hi> 13.1.) therefore <hi>chief.</hi> This honour have all the Saints; the Birth-right is theirs, and theirs is the Bleſſing: They, as all holy things, are dedicated to God, and graciouſly accepted with him, as a choſen Generation, as a peculiar people. He who is Lord over all, and Father of all, both things and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as they ſtand in the whole compaſs of Nature, is eminently and with endeared affections, a Father to all them who believe and are actually in a ſtate of grace.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, If God be a Father to all creatures, and to man more than to inferiour creatures, and to true Beleevers more than to other men; then as his fatherhood is extended, ſo is his fatherly care. God will not be wanting to any as a Father, to whom he is upon any account a Father. He takes care of the fruits of the earth, and of the beaſt of the field, and of all mankind, he feeds them all, and cloaths them all, and protects them all; but they who are a kind of firſt-fruits of his creatures, and bears the image of his holineſs, or his Image in holineſs, have a ſpecial portion and proportion of his care over them, and love to them, and proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for them. <hi>What can he deny to us as a Father, who hath vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed to be our father?

                     </note> We may take notice of two things in the falling of the Dew.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It falls very ſilently; Secondly, very abundantly. No man hears the Dew fall, nor can any number the drops of Dew which fall. <hi>Huſhai</hi> uſed both theſe alluſions, in that piece of loyal counſel which he gave for the defeating of the counſel of <hi>Achito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phel</hi> (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11.12.) where he adviſed <hi>Abſalom, te gather all Iſrael from Dan to Beerſheba, as the ſand which is by the ſea for multitude;</hi> and ſo, ſaith he, <hi>we will light upon him as the Dew fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth upon the ground;</hi> that is, we will come ſo ſilently upon him, and in ſuch numbers (even as the drops of Dew upon the ground) that he ſhall not be able to avoyd us, no more than he can avoyd the Dew, which in one and the ſame inſtant falls upon the field or Country all over. An Army comes with an intent to fall upon
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:48669:121"/> the enemy like a ſtorm, yet it may be ſaid to come and fall upon him like a Dew, both becauſe it comes alwayes like a multitude, and becauſe it comes ſomtimes very ſilently to ſurprize him at unawares. <hi>Who hath begotten the drops of Dew?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>Hence Note, as before of the Rain, ſo here of the Dew, <hi>God is the father of the Dew, as well as of the Rain.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>The Dew differs not much from the Rain; both are of the ſame nature, and they have the ſame Father, and he will be own'd in the Dew as well as in the Rain. The Prophet <hi>Haggai</hi> reprov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the returned <hi>Jewes</hi> (Chap. 1.10.) for their neglect in not building the Lords Houſe, repreſents the Lord thus ſpeaking to them; <hi>Becauſe of my houſe that is waſt, and ye run every man to his own houſe;</hi> that is, you eagerly and violently (running is a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent exerciſe) purſue your private ends and intereſts, not mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nor promoting my honour and worſhip; <hi>Therefore the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven over you is ſtayed from Dew, and the earth is ſtayed from her fruit.</hi> The want of Dew makes many wants. If we want but the Dew of Heaven we ſhall quickly want the fruits of the Earth. We uſually take notice of the want of Rain, but we ſeldome take notice of the want of Dew, or pray for the falling of it; nor do we give thanks for it (as for Rain) when we ſee it fallen, and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly filling the boſome of the earth. Yet the with-holding of Dew (though Dew be a leſs matt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r than Rain) is a greater Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than the with-holding of Rain; for 'tis a ſign that the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of drought is at the height, or in the perfection of it, when the Lord doth not only with hold the Rain which is the greater mercy, but the Dew too, which is the leſſer. O how dry muſt the earth be when it hath not only no plentiful ſhowers of Rain, but not ſo much as a drop of Dew!

And when the Lord would ſhew how plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in mercy (chiefly in ſpiritual mercies) he would be to his people, he ſaith (<hi>Hoſea</hi> 14.5, 6.) <hi>I will be as a Dew unto Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, and he ſhall grow as the Lilly, and caſt forth his roots as Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banon; his branches ſhall ſpread, and his beauty ſhall be as the Olive tree, and his ſmell as Lebanon.</hi> Thus the Lord ſpake by the Prophet, in alluſion to thoſe great effects which the natural Dew produceth on Earth. <hi>Solomon</hi> having ſaid (<hi>Prov.</hi> 19.12.) that, <hi>the</hi> (juſt and deſerved) <hi>wrath of a King is like the roaring of a lion,</hi> preſently adds, <hi>but his favour is as the Dew upon the graſs;</hi> that is, he exceedingly comforts and refreſheth the hearts of all upon whom his favour falls. And when the Prophet <hi>Micah,</hi> (chap. 5.7.) would ſhew how great a bleſſing the people of God would be to any place where they were caſt, he ſaith, <hi>The remnant of Jacob ſhall be in the midſt of many people</hi> (how?) <hi>as Dew from the Lord, and as ſhowers upon the graſs.</hi> By <hi>the remnant of Jacob,</hi> he means the choſen and faithful remainder of <hi>Jacob</hi> after many ſcatterings and trials; thoſe few of the people of God in the midſt of the world whereſoever they are, ſhall be as Dew upon the g aſs; that is, they ſhall be a great bleſſing to them. The wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

So ſaith the Prophet concerning all the remnant of <hi>Jacob, they ſhall be in the midſt of many people as a dew upon the graſs, that waiteth not for man, nor tarrieth for the ſon of man; they ſhall be as a Dew from the Lord;</hi> that is, there ſhall be a great multitude of them, and they ſhall be as a Dew, that is, they ſhall diſtill ſweetly upon thoſe <hi>many people as a Dew from the Lord, and as the ſhowres upon the graſs, that tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:48669:123"/> not for man, nor waiteth for the ſons of men.</hi> The graſs in the field is not watered by man, as herbs and flowers in a garden are, and therefore may be ſaid not to tarry, nor to depend upon man, nor upon the ſons of men, but upon God for the Dew and Showers of heaven to water it. Thus thoſe many people ſhall have help and ſweet ſupplies; though men neglect them, yet God will take care of them, and ſend the remnant of <hi>Jacob,</hi> ſome or other that are faithful, to be as a Dew from him upon them, to make them grow and be fruitful.</p>
                  <p>Before I paſs from this verſe, we may conſider a threefold al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion of the Dew.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To Chriſt himſelf. One of the Ancients expounding that place (<hi>Judges</hi> 6.37, 40.) where <hi>Gideon</hi> deſired as a ſign from the Lord that he would ſave <hi>Iſrael</hi> by his hand, that the Dew might fall on the fleece, the floor remaining dry; and afterward, that the Dew might fall upon the floor, the fleece remaining dry; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes,<note place="margin">Ros in vellere, Chriſtus in virgine. <hi>Rupertus in Hoſ. 14.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>The Dew in the fleece, is Chriſt in the Virgin.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt indeed came down from heaven as the Dew, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing and comforting of poor ſinners; he came down alſo as a Dew to make us fruitful and grow as the Lilly, and to caſt forth our roots as <hi>Lebanon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, In the Dew there is an alluſion to the word of God preached. The diſpenſers of the Goſpel are compared to Clouds; <hi>Moſes</hi> was a Cloud, and his <hi>ſpeech diſtilled as the dew, (Deut.</hi> 32.2.) that is, it came down ſweetly and efficaciouſly. As <hi>the manna and the dew fell together</hi> (Exod. 16.12, 14.) ſo the graces, comforts, and powers of the Spirit come with the word; there's dew with the Manna, and Manna with the dew. When the dew of divine doctrine comes down, Chriſt the Manna comes down too.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It carries in it an alluſion to that ſweetneſs of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction that is among brethren (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 133.1.) <hi>Behold how good and how pleaſant it is, for brethren to dwel together in unity!</hi> then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows (<hi>verſ.</hi> 3.) <hi>As the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended upon the mountains of Zion; for there the Lord command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the bleſſing, even life for evermore.</hi> Love and unity among bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren is like dew, it refreſheth them and makes them fruitful; <hi>They who provoke one another to love, will alſo to good works</hi> (Heb. 10.24.) Unity makes a great increaſe. Small things grow great

                  <p>So much of Gods Father-hood or relation to the Rain and Dew: In the next words he is pleaſed to enquire of <hi>Job</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the original of Ice and Froſt.</p>

                     </bibl> Out of whoſe womb came the Ice?</q>
                  <p>Theſe words are an elegant Metaphor taken from Child-bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. What woman can the Ice call Mother? God is here com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a Mother, for the ſame reaſon for which he was before compared to a Father. We are to note (ſaith <hi>Aquinas</hi> upon this place) that Cold is the cauſe of Ice, which is a feminine or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſh quality; but the cauſe of rain and dew is heat, which is a maſculine or manly quality. And therefore the Lord ſpeaking of the generation of rain and dew, uſeth the word Father; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the generation of Ice and Froſt he uſeth a word moſt proper to the Mother; <hi>Out of whoſe womb came the Ice?</hi> The word ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>womb</hi> ſignifies the whole belly, yea the whole body. Thus (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 132.11.) <hi>Of the fruit of thy body, &amp;c.</hi> The Hebrew is <hi>belly,</hi> ſo the word is uſed (<hi>Gen.</hi> 15.4. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 22.21.) but according to our Tranſlation it ſtrictly relates to the Mother, as if God would take upon him both ſexes, and be, as, the Father of <hi>the rain and dew,</hi> ſo, the Mother of the <hi>Ice</hi> and <hi>Froſt.</hi> The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients inſiſt much upon this ſetting forth the glory of God in the former verſe as a Father, and here as a Mother, out of whoſe womb the Ice comes; and they tell us of ſome who never had Scripture light,<note place="margin">Clemens A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandrinus, l. 5.

<pb n="230" facs="tcp:48669:125"/> as water;</hi> yet this unſtable body can the Lord change into a ſtone, and make it hard as a rock. Hiſtories are full of ſtrange reports concerning the effects of cold. There have been ſuch Froſts and Freezings, that great waters, mighty rivers, yea ſome parts of the Sea have been turned into a ſtone: Houſes have been built upon theſe congealed waters, and Battels have been fought upon them.<note place="margin">Strabo l. 2.</note> The Army of King <hi>Mithridates</hi> overcame the enemy in a pitcht Battel upon the Ice. And 'tis freſh in memory, how the late King of <hi>Sweden</hi> a few years ſince, paſſed his Army over an arm of the Sea,<note place="margin">Danubius ripas golu jungit du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratuſque glacie ingentia tergo bella tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat. <hi>Plin. in Panegyr.</hi>

                  <p>Now as the power of God is great in hardning that which is ſoft,<note place="margin">Concreſcunt ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitae currenti in flumine cruſtae. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndaque jam tergo ferratos ſuſtinet orbes, puppibus illa prius patulis, nunc hoſpita plauſtris. <hi>Virg. l. 3.

                     </note> ſo in ſoftning that which is hard. He that turns water into a ſtone, can turn ſtones into water. So the Pſalmiſt expreſſeth the miracle of bringing water out of the rock for <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the wilderneſs (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 114.7, 8.) <hi>Tremble thou Earth at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Lord, at the preſence of the God of Jacob, which turned the rock into a ſtanding water; the flint into a fountain of waters.</hi> This is a glorious work, the turning of a viſible rock in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to water; but the work of God is more glorious in ſoftning a hard heart, or in turning the rocky heart of an impenitent ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, or the inviſible rock of an impenitent ſinners heart into the waters of godly ſorrow, working repentance not to be repented of. We ſhould much more magnifie the power of God, when we ſee hearts of ſtone melted and diſſolved into thoſe ſpiritual waters, than when (though that be a mighty work of God) we ſee the natural waters turned into, or (as the Text gives it) <hi>hid as with a ſtone,</hi> or when we ſee (as it followeth in the Text) that
<q>The face of the deep is frozen.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>That is, the uppermoſt part of the deep is frozen; and, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, the Lord puts this in <hi>(the face of the deep)</hi> to ſhew that the cold hath not only power in the ſhallow ſtanding waters, but in that which is deep, and deep to amazement; ſo deep, that it is called, <hi>The Deep;</hi> as if all other waters were but ſhallows, compared with that. So then, not ponds only and rivers and
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:48669:125"/> ſhallow waters, but <hi>the face of the deep,</hi> where one would think the Froſt could have no power, is frozen.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, Ice and Froſt reſemble all humane things. The things of this world, are they not like a Sea of Ice? that is, Firſt, Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſlippery. Secondly, Very Uncertain, how long they will laſt or continue. Some conceive, that, the Sea of glaſſe like unto Chryſtal, which was repreſented unto St <hi>John</hi> in Viſion (<hi>Rev.</hi> 4.6. &amp; 15.2.) ſignified the ſtate of the world, which is like <hi>a Sea,</hi> becauſe of the tumultuouſneſs of it; and like <hi>a Sea of glaſſe,</hi> becauſe of the brittleneſs of it; and <hi>a Sea of glaſſe like Chryſtal,</hi> becauſe of the clearneſs and tranſparency of it to God; he ſees quite thorow it: to him all things are naked and manifeſt. Such a thing is the world, 'tis a frozen Sea, eſpecially for the ſlippe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs and uncertainty of it. For though the Sea be turned into a ſtone, yet no man knows how ſoon a Thaw may diſſolve it back again into water? The things of this world ſuffer ſudden changes. Though men have worldly eſtates, like to mountains of ſtone or rocks, yet the Lord can make theſe mountains, theſe rocks, melt at, and flow down at his preſence (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.2.) The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt mountains of worldly power and riches, which ſeem to be as hard as rocks, as compact as mountains of Adamant, are yet but like mountains of Ice before the Lord; if he let forth but a little heat of his anger and diſpleaſure againſt them, they melt like wax before the fire, or like a heap of ſnow before the Sun, and ſlow down preſently like water. Should we ſee men building up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Ice (as ſome have done in a proper ſenſe) we would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſay, they build upon a very unſure foundation. They who build their hopes upon any perſon or thing in this world, are no wiſer, and do no better than they who build upon the Ice. All
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:48669:126"/> things here below are uncertain, they may, yea, they muſt ſoon melt and paſs away, from us, or we from them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Ice and Froſt, the cold ſeaſon, of which the Text ſpeaketh, reſembles a ſtate of affliction and adverſity; that's Ice, that's Froſt. As warm Sun-ſhine reſembles a ſtate of proſperity, ſo Cold and Froſt a ſtate of adverſity; and ſo it doth in a four-fold reſpect.</p>

<pb n="233" facs="tcp:48669:126"/> added to the felicity of that eſtate which is ſhadowed under theſe Metaphors? Such a Summer of ſpiritual felicity in tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral liberties, after a winter of temporal ſufferings in her ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, did Chriſt invite his Church in general unto: And this may relieve particular Chriſtians in their afflictions. The cold Froſt ſeldome laſts long, never alwayes.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Though Cold and Froſt be pinching and troubleſome while they laſt, yet they have a very good effect upon the Earth while they laſt. Firſt, they mellow the Earth. After a laſting Froſt the clods of Earth crumble eaſily, whereas if it lie all the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter without a Froſt, they are more ſtiffe, and not ſo fit for husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry: Thus afflictions mellow the heart of man, and make it more fit for Gods husbandry. As Froſt dries up the ill humours of the Earth, ſo doth affliction thoſe of the ſoul; and thereby prepares it to receive the ſeed of the Word. When God afflicts his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, it is <hi>for their profit, that they may be partakers of his holineſs;</hi> that is, that they may profitab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>y improve all thoſe means which he hath appointed to make them more holy. And hence,</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, As Froſt and Cold kill the weeds and worms which eat the roots and hinder the growth of Herbs, Corn, and Plants; ſo afflictions kill our luſts, thoſe worms and weeds that breed and grow in our hearts, alwayes hindering the fruitfulneſs, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time to the utter unfruitfulneſs, of the ſeed of the word ſown a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us and upon us (<hi>Matth.</hi> 13.22.) The froſt of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction is a means to prevent the worm which breeds naturally out of the corruption of our hearts, even that terrible worm ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.24.) the worm of conſcience. As there are worms of corruption, Pride, Covetouſneſs, Wrath, Wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in our hearts; ſo out of theſe that tormenting worm breeds, called the worm of Conſcience. Now, the froſt of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction which God ſends upon us, is very effectual, as to kill theſe worms of corruption which eat the roots of our graces, and hinder our fruit-bearing; ſo to prevent the life of that worm of Conſcience, which (as the Prophet ſpeaks in the place laſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med) <hi>never dyeth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore, as when the Lord ſends froſt, though it make us ſhake, and we have a hard time of it, yet no man riſeth up in paſſion and ſaith, I had rather dye, and be out of the world, than live in ſuch a ſeaſon; No, men know that a froſty ſeaſon, is a
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:48669:127"/> wholeſome ſeaſon, and they know Summer will come and make amends. So when we are in the Winter of affliction, let us not be impatient nor unquiet; let us not think that the froſt will ruine and undo us. Though Ice be upon every water, though Icicles hang upon every twig, do not think this will be at all for your undoing, it may be much for your bettering. Cold weather doth good as well as hot; and if we ſhould have all hot, and no cold, it might be very ill, very bad to us; therefore be not troubled at the cold, nor afraid of ice and froſt, they will not hurt you, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs you hurt your ſelves, by your impatience under them. And when 'tis coldeſt, you may warme your ſelves at the fire or Sun-ſhine of this hope, that ere long the weather will be warmer. As <hi>Athanaſius</hi> ſaid of the trouble given the Church by that Apoſtate <hi>Julian, It is but a Cloud, it will ſoon be over;</hi> ſo may I ſay, according to the alluſion in this Text, its but a Winters froſt, Summer will come: This ſhould be the comfort of all that fear God in a day of evil feared or felt. When Chriſt (<hi>Mat.</hi> 24.32, 33.) had ſoretold the ſigns of his coming, he ſaid, <hi>Learn a Parable of the Fig-tree, when his branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that Summer is nigh: So likewiſe, ye, when ye ſhall ſee all theſe things, know that it is near, even at the door.</hi> As when we ſhall ſee thoſe dreadful appearances, which are the fore-runners of Chriſt coming, ſo when we ſhall feel any chilling froſts of affliction, then we may know that Summer is at hand; when the night is darkeſt, the light is neareſt; when Winter is hardeſt, a thawing Sun leading in the Spring is approaching to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us.</p>
                  <p>There is but one kind of cold or froſt which we have cauſe to fear, and that is the froſt of unkindneſs, or the coldneſs of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to God and one another; and I warn all to take heed of that, becauſe it is but too too probable, that this froſt and cold will hang about the hearts of many in the latter days; yea, is it not viſible, are we not ſenſible of that froſt begun, at leaſt, in theſe days? as Chriſt himſelf propheſied of thoſe latter days, (<hi>Mat.</hi> 24.12.) <hi>The love of many ſhall wax cold;</hi> is not love to God very chil? is not charity to man, among men, of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, as cold as ice at this day? Take heed of this froſt, of this cold; let not your hearts be frozen in love to God or Man. It is ſad when the ſtreams of charitable bounty are frozen, and the
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:48669:127"/> waters of compaſſion hidden as with a ſtone, when the very bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of men are Ice, and their hearts harder to one another, than the nether mil-ſtone?</p>
                  <p>There are two things much to be lamented, whenever they are ſeen or felt among the Sons of men; eſpecially among thoſe who profeſs themſelves the Servants of God. The firſt is heat of anger and wrath. The ſecond is coldneſs of love and zeal. As that heat is apt to kindle unnatural fires, ſo this coldneſs may provoke the Lord to kindle judiciary fires, or fiery judgments. The coldneſs of the air will not hurt us, nor can the froſt of any affliction much annoy us, if our love wax not cold, if the froſt of uncharitableneſs to one another, and of unzealouſneſs (if I may ſo ſpeak) for God and his concerns, take not our affections.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Hence obſerve:
<q>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> God hath planted a virtue in the Stars of heaven, which they ſhed down upon the earth.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The creatures of the earth, are (as I may ſay) fed and fattened from heaven. All <hi>Vegetatives,</hi> graſs, herbs, plants, flowers, trees; all <hi>Senſitives,</hi> beaſts of the earth, fowls of the air; yea, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional creatures too, all men who breath in the air, and walk up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth, are refreſhed and fed by the influences of heaven, by the clouds and ſtars. Further, the Stars ſend down their influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, not only upon living creatures in their three ranks, but even upon inanimate creatures; the minerals, the ſtones that lye deep under the earth, the precious gems, with thoſe of a courſer grain, receive much from the influences of the Stars. So then, all earthly bodies receive and derive their vigor and beauty from the heavenly; the Sun and Moon have the greateſt power, and there is a very great power in the Stars and Conſtellations, in the <hi>Pleiades, Orion,</hi> and <hi>Arcturus,</hi> for the production of great effects.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, In that 'tis ſaid, <hi>Canſt thou bind,</hi> or ſtop the Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of <hi>Pleiades?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="239" facs="tcp:48669:129"/>
                  <p>Obſerve,
<q>It is not in the power of man, of any man, to hinder or ſtay the virtue of the ſtars from falling down upon the earth.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>What God will do by the creature, no man can undo. If God ſet thoſe heavenly bodies at liberty, and bids them ſend down their influences, man cannot lock them up, nor impriſon their powers, nor bind them from working?</p>
                  <p>And hence we may inferr. Firſt, if none can bind the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, nor ſtay the comfortable virtue of the ſtars, when God is pleaſed to let them out? then much leſs can any bind or hinder the influences of the Spirit. When God is pleaſed to ſend his Spirit to work upon the heart of man, who can lett him?</p>
                  <p>There is a threefold influence or work of the ſpirit of God upon the ſoul of man.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To enlighten, or to give the light of the knowledge of his own glory in the face of Jeſus Chriſt. Who can hinder God, when he purpoſeth thus to inſtruct and teach the ignorant, and make them wiſe unto Salvation, wiſer than their teachers; who can hinder it?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, To convert, to work faith and repentance, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with love, humility, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe graces are deſtilled, and drop down from the Spirit of God upon the ſoul; and who can hinder the Spirit from working them in the moſt hardened and unbelieving ſouls in the moſt vain, proud, and preſumptuous ſoul? the barren'ſt wilderneſs, dryeſt heath (ſuch are perſons unconverted) are made fruitful by the influences of the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, To refreſh and comfort. There are unſpeakable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of joy deſtilled from the ſpirit upon believers; and when God will let them down from heaven, who can lett them? what can let them? All the troubles and ſorrows, all the pains and tortures, that men can invent or inflict upon a believer, cannot bind theſe influences of the Spirit, nor hinder joy in believing. The greateſt evils of this life, can neither ſhut up nor ſhut out, that comfort which the Spirit ſpeaketh. The moſt churliſh winds that can blow from the coldeſt quarters of the world cannot chill, much leſs kill or blaſt thoſe fruits of the Spirit, <hi>Love, joy, peace, long-ſuffering, gentleneſs, goodneſs, ſaith, meekneſs, temperance,</hi> mentioned by the Apoſtle (<hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22, 23.) The ſoul grows
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:48669:130"/> green, like a Garden or Paſture, in the Spring; the ſoul bud's, bloſſom's, and brings forth theſe bleſſed fruits abundantly, when fed with theſe dainties and delicacies of the Spirit. Thoſe great floods of trouble and perſecution, which the Serpent, any where, or at any time caſts out of his mouth, cannot prevail againſt the leaſt drop of Conſolation, wrought in the heart by the Spirits influence. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> were bound in Priſon, but there their perſecutors could not bind the ſweet influences of the Spirit from comforting them, nor daunt them by any terror from triumphing in Chriſt; they could ſing in Priſon, yea, they ſung at Midnight.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We may Inferr; If God hath placed the Stars in heaven, to drop down ſweet influences upon us, then at every ſight of the Stars our hearts ſhould be raiſed up, in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring thoughts of the wiſdom, goodneſs, and power of God. We uſually look upon the Stars, as if they were only ſo many lights beſpangling the Canopy of heaven, and ſparkling, as ſo many fires in the firmament; but we ſeldom conſider their vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, their influences, or the wonderful effects which they produce How few are there, who behold the heavens with <hi>Davids</hi> eyes. (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 8.3, 4.) <hi>When I</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>conſider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers; the Moon and the Stars which thou haſt made: What is man, that thou are mindful of him?</hi> God is mindful of man, not only to give him light by the Moon and Stars, by the benefit whereof he ſees other things; but God gives many unſeen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits by the Moon and Stars. The influences of the Stars are as beneficial to us,<note place="margin">Qui negat eſſe Deum ſpectet modo fidero c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Here we have two ſorts of precious things. Firſt, <hi>The precious things of heaven.</hi> Secondly, <hi>The precious things of the earth, of the hills and mountains.</hi> The former precious things are the cauſe, the latter the effect: The precious things of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, are the influences of the Sun and Moon, under which we are to comprehend the influences of the Stars, theſe cauſe or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce <hi>the precious things of the earth;</hi> that is, Graſs, Hearbs, with all ſorts of Vegetables growing upon the ſurface of the earth, they produce alſo <hi>the precious things of the ancient moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and of the laſting hills;</hi> that is, gems or precious ſtones, gold and ſilver, together with all ſorts of inferiour minerals. Now if the Stars, by their influences, yield us all theſe precious things, have we not much cauſe to admire both the power of God, who hath implanted thoſe vertues and opperations in them, as alſo his goodneſs, who hath ordained both thoſe cauſes, and their products or effects, for the benefit and comfort, yea, for the contentment and delight of man? <hi>What is man, that God ſhould be thus mindful of him;</hi> that for his ſake and uſe, or for the ſweetning of his paſſage through the Wilderneſs of this troubleſome world, he ſhould impregnate the earth by the ſweet influences of heaven? It hath been ſaid; <hi>Let him look to the Stars of heaven, who denies the God of heaven; and doubtleſs he will not only not deny, but not ſo much as doubt that there is a God in heaven, who duely conſiders the pure nature, and the irreſiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble operations of the Stars of heaven?

                     <hi>this</hi> Orion, ſee more at the 9th <hi>Chapter (ver.</hi> 9.) I ſhall only ſay thus much further here, That theſe words ſtand in direct oppoſition to the former, ſhewing that as <hi>Job</hi> could not ſtop thoſe <hi>Benigne Stars, the Pleiades,</hi> from giving forth their vertues to the earth; ſo he could not looſe the bands of that ſevere and harſh Star, nor divert the effects which it brings upon the earth. <hi>Canſt thou looſe the bands of</hi>
                     <pb n="243" facs="tcp:48669:131"/> Orion? Hence learn, firſt, in general.</p>
                  <q>Cold is a binder, a great and mighty binder.</q>
                  <p>Winter binds the earth from bearing, and it binds the hands of men from working; when a man is extream cold he can make little uſe of his hands.</p>
                  <p>And as Natural, ſo Spiritual cold is a great binder. A cold heart is a bound heart. When the heart hath in it no heat of love to God, or hath not been heated with a ſence of the love of God: when the heart hath in it no heat of zeal for the glory of God, nor for the good of men; when theſe ſad colds are upon the heart, 'tis bound indeed. He that hath this cold upon him, can ſay but little to God; and will ſay, and do leſs for God: He is bound not only hand and foot, but tongue alſo. Take heed of cold upon your hearts, it will hinder you from holy activity, bind you up from duty both towards God and man. He that is only luke-warm will do God little ſervice, can do none that is pleaſing and acceptable unto God; but he that is key-cold, as we ſay, neither will, nor can do any thing at all, that may be called Service. The Apoſtle Paul (<hi>Acts</hi> 20.22.) <hi>was bound in the Spirit to go to</hi> Jeruſalem, which was a great ſervice for Chriſt; that is, The heat of true affection, which the inſtinct of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit cauſed in him, engaged him beyond all power of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation to undertake that hazardous journey. But when any are bound in ſpirit by the coldneſs of their affections to Chriſt, they always prove hand-bound and foot-bound, I may ſay (without affectation according to the uſe of that word in our language) hide-bound alſo, as to any thing that is good; eſpecially, if it be (as it was in the Apoſtles caſe now mentioned) either dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous or coſtly. And when a ſoul is in thoſe bands of the <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Orion,</hi> the evil ſpirit, ſurely none but God can looſe them, ſeeing none but he can looſe theſe in the Text. <hi>Canſt thou looſe the bands of</hi> Orion, <hi>the Winter-bands?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note,
<q>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is not in the power of man to looſe what God binds.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Lord put the queſtion to <hi>Job</hi> about his works, that he might ſee his own weakneſs and utter inability to undo his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidential workings: When God had <hi>Job</hi> in bonds, it was not in
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:48669:132"/> his power to looſe his bonds by his ſtrength and ſtriving. The providences of God were to him as <hi>Orion</hi> to the earth, cold and ſharp, cauſing the froſt of adverſity to bind him ſo ſtrongly, that he could by no means looſe himſelf. Chriſt ſaith to his Diſciples about Church-cenſures rightly laid, and Church-approbation du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given (<hi>Mat.</hi> 18.18.) <hi>Whatſoever ye bind on earth, ſhall be bound in heaven; and whatſoever ye ſhall looſe on earth, ſhall be looſed in heaven.</hi> Where man binds in Gods way, God binds too; and where man looſes in Gods way, God looſes too; but take it ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in natural or ſpiritual things, it is not in the power of man to bind where God looſeth, nor to looſe where God bindeth: <hi>Canſt thou looſe the bands of Orion?</hi> If God appoint cold to bind the earth, man cannot looſe it; and if God will bind man with the cords and cold iron of any affliction, man cannot free himſelf. In the hotteſt natural ſeaſon of the year, man may be in cold provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential bands, and under them he muſt abide till the Lord breaks the froſt and ſet him free. It is ſaid of <hi>Joſeph (Pſal.</hi> 105.17, 18, 19.) <hi>He was ſold for a ſervant, his feet were hurt with fetters, he was laid in iron;</hi> or, (as the Margin reads it) <hi>His ſoul came into iron.</hi> But how came he out? did he himſelf looſe the bands of that <hi>Orion</hi> who caſt him into priſon? ſurely no, the Text tells us otherwiſe; he lay faſt enough in bands, <hi>until</hi> (ver. 19.) <hi>the word of the Lord came; the word of the Lord tryed him.</hi> But what was this Word of the Lord? ſome ſay, it was the word of God to <hi>Pharoah</hi> in a dream, concerning the ſeven years of plenty and famine, which may be ſaid to try <hi>Joſeph,</hi> none but he could inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret it, &amp; that may be ſaid to unlooſe his bands, becauſe it was the occaſion of his deliverance and advancement. But I rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the word that came, was the word of Gods decree and promiſe made to <hi>Joſeph</hi> in a dream, for his advancement above all his brethren (<hi>Gen.</hi> 37.6, 7, 8.) When once the time came that this Word of God muſt come to be fulfilled, then the bands of <hi>Orion</hi> were looſed; for then (ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> ver. 20.) <hi>The King ſent and looſed him, even the Ruler of the people, and let him go free.</hi> And as it was with <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſo with <hi>Job,</hi> and ſo will ever be. If the cold winter blaſts of any adverſity bind up our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, either in our callings or relations, there is no unlooſing them un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="245" facs="tcp:48669:132"/> in the world. The reaſon of this counſel follows; <hi>For, who can make that ſtrait which he hath made crooked? Solomon</hi> intends this ſpecially of the dealings of God in the world; not that there is any crookedneſs or unrighteouſneſs, any iniquity or injuſtice in the ways of God; but he means by crooked, that which is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſom and grievous. Now if God himſelf make a thing crooked, till he himſelf make it ſtrait, it is not in the power of all the men in the world to do it. The moral ſenſe of that Text, is the very ſame with the point in hand; If God bind, who can looſe? There is no ſtriving, no contending with the providences of God: we muſt deal with, and apply to God himſelf for the altering of them, we cannot alter them our ſelves; we muſt deſire him to mend his work, we cannot: This <hi>Solomon</hi> plainly intimates in the next, or 14. <hi>verſe; In the day of proſperity be joyful, but in the day of adverſity conſider</hi> (in a time of adverſity things grow crooked and awry from what we would have and deſire, or from what is comfortable to us) <hi>for God hath ſet the one over againſt the other, to the end that man ſhould find nothing after him.</hi> Sometimes he makes things crooked, ſometimes ſtrait; ſometimes he gives a day of proſperity, ſometimes of adverſity, that no man may be able to ſay directly, what ſhall be next. And ſeeing there is no looſing the bands of <hi>Orion</hi> till God himſelf looſe them; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let all who are companions in tribulation, ſay one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as they in a like caſe are repreſented, (<hi>Hoſea</hi> 6.1.) <hi>Come, and let us return unto the Lord, for he hath wounded, and he will heal; he hath torn, and he will bind us up:</hi> O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Whence note;
<q>God can both ſtop the ordinary courſe of our comforts, and deliver us from our troubles when he pleaſeth.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>God can ſtop thoſe things from comforting us, and thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons from ſhewing us any favour, whoſe diſpoſitions are as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigne to us, as <hi>Pleiades</hi> are to the earth; and he can give us favour in their eyes, who naturally are as churliſh as <hi>Nabal,</hi> and
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:48669:133"/> as ſharp as <hi>Orion</hi> to the earth. He can make a Wolf a Shepherd, and thoſe a ſafety to his ſervants, whoſe hearts were to ſwallow them up. The earth ſhall help the woman, that is, the worſt of the world, the Church. God made Ravens feed <hi>Eliah</hi> (1 <hi>Kings</hi> 17.4.) And he ſaid of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> whom he calls a <hi>ravenous Bird, (Iſa.</hi> 46.11.) <hi>He is my Shepherd (Iſa.</hi> 44.28.) Thus the Lord looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the bands of <hi>Orion.</hi> And when he hardens their hearts againſt us, who formerly were tender towards us, or when he turns their hearts to hate us, who formerly loved us and ſhewed us favour, then the Lord may be ſaid to bind the ſweet influences of <hi>Pleia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des.</hi> What ſweet influences of favour did the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> receive from <hi>Pharoah</hi> and the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> at their firſt coming thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and long after? yet afterwards, what grievous Task-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters were they to them? their favours were all reſtrained and changed into yokes and bands: whence was this? The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> anſwers fully (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 105.25.) <hi>He</hi> (that is God) <hi>turned their heart</hi> (that is, the heart of the <hi>Egyptians) to hate his people, to deal ſubtilly with his ſervants,</hi> and cruelly too. Thus the Power and Name of God is both wayes magnified. Whenas we have the moſt benigne <hi>Pleiades</hi> dropping down ſweet influences upon us, God can ſtop them; and when we have the hardeſt bands of <hi>Orion</hi> upon us, the Lord is able to looſe them. This glory is due to God in all the changes which we meet with in this world, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from good to bad, from the favours to the frowns of men; or from bad to good, from their frowns to their favours, from their bands to their embraces: all is of God. And I conceive the ſcope of God in theſe queſtions, was chiefly to bring <hi>Job</hi> to that concluſion. The next verſe bears the ſame ſenſe.</p>

                  <p>Let us come forth in our ſeaſon. The Stars are brought forth in theirs, and ſhall not we! happy are they that <hi>come forth, and bring forth</hi> in their ſeaſon. To hit time is a mercy as well as a duty! <hi>Paul</hi> indeed ſaid of himſelf, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.8.) that <hi>he was an abortive,</hi> or <hi>born out of due time.</hi> An abortive in nature, is one that comes into the world before the due time. <hi>Paul,</hi> as to his ſpiritual birth or new birth through grace, was not, nor can any one be new-born before the due time. We may rather ſay, that we are new-born too late than too ſoon, or before our time. <hi>Paul</hi> might ſay he had been too long a proud <hi>Phariſie,</hi> a formal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor, and at laſt, a perſecutor of thoſe who profeſſed the truth of the Goſpel in truth; and therefore in that ſence <hi>Paul</hi> was not an abortive, or born out of due time, namely, before his time: But <hi>Paul</hi> might ſay ſo of himſelf, that he was ſo, Firſt, Becauſe he was the laſt of the Apoſtles that was called. The other Apoſtles were called by Chriſt, while he lived here on earth: <hi>Paul</hi> was called by Chriſt from heaven, after his death and departure from the earth. Secondly, He was born like an abortive, or thoſe that come out of due time, becauſe of the violence, and grievous pangs which accompanied his new-birth: He was ſmitten from his horſe to the ground, and lay as one dead in his paſſage to his new-life. Such was the ſuddenneſs and violence of his converſion, that it was moſt like an abortion. Thirdly, The Apoſtle himſelf ſeems to give the reaſon in the next <hi>Verſe;</hi> we know abortives are uſually very weak and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect children, and leſs in body than thoſe born in due time. Now ſuch was Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> humility, ſo low was he in his own thoughts, that he calls himſelf (<hi>verſ.</hi> 9.) <hi>the leaſt of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, not meet to be called an Apoſtle.</hi> In all theſe, or in any of theſe notions, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> might ſay he was born out of due time; yet both as to the truth and ſeaſonableneſs of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, he was born in due time and in his full time. Now as there is a due time, a ſeaſon for our ſpiritual birth, ſo for our
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:48669:134"/> fruit-bearing in ſpirituals. It is ſaid of every godly man (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.3.) <hi>He ſhall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his ſeaſon,</hi> that is, ſeaſonable fruit. The Stars appear in their ſeaſon, and ſo ſhould the fruits of every Goſpel-profeſſor. If we ſhould ſee Winter-ſtars in Summer, and Summer-ſtars in Winter; if the Sun ſhould riſe at Mid-night, or go down at Mid-day, how prodigious would that appearance and diſappearance be! if the Sun ſhould not riſe and ſet juſt at the time we look for him, it would breed horror, and put all men into an amazement. But now the Lord brings forth <hi>Mazzaroth</hi> and all the Stars in their ſeaſon. O therefore, let us look to our ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; we ſhall be reproved elſe by the Stars of heaven, <hi>Mazza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roth</hi> will be a witneſs againſt us. <hi>Canſt thou bring forth</hi> Mazza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roth <hi>in his ſeaſon?</hi>

                  <p>The Lord (I ſay) having done queſtioning <hi>Job,</hi> about theſe four notable Conſtellations of heaven in ſpecial, proceeds to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogate him more generally about the whole heavens, in the next Verſe.</p>

                  <p>Surely as thou knoweſt not the ſpecial laws by which I govern the <hi>Pleiades, Orion, Mazzaroth</hi> and <hi>Arcturus,</hi> ſo not the general laws by which the heavens are governed. <hi>Knoweſt thou the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of heaven?</hi> The word here rendred <hi>Ordinances,</hi> is often rendred in the Pſalms <hi>ſtatutes, laws, decrees: knoweſt thou the laws or ſtatutes of heaven?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The word rendred <hi>heaven</hi> is of the dual number, as Gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians ſpeake, becauſe, in what part ſoever of the earth any man ſtands, the heaven is cut in two parts (as to him) by the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon, whereof one part is over him, and the other under him; As there is a heaven above us, ſo a heaven below us, though whereſoever any man is on earth, heaven is above him. <hi>Knoweſt thou</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Now the Ordinances of heaven may be of two ſorts.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Thoſe which God hath given to the heavens. The hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly bodies move according to his conſtitutions who made hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth.<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Thoſe which the heavens give to the earth, or to man on earth. The heavens may be ſaid to impoſe their laws upon the earth, men being guided and directed by the changes and motions of the heavens, how to order many of their motions and actions on the earth, thoſe eſpecially which concern the earth. The heavens give theſe common laws (as I may ſay) to men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the earth: Firſt, When to Till the earth. Secondly, When to caſt their Seed into the earth. Thirdly, When
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:48669:136"/> to reap and gather the fruit of the earth. When to perform any part of Husbandry to the earth, is known only by the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens; that is, the heavens by their motions and viciſſitudes, ſhew men the ſeaſons of doing theſe and theſe works on earth. And if men obey not theſe laws of heaven, nor obſerve their ſeaſons, they looſe all their labour and coſt beſtowed on the earth.</p>
                  <p>Again, when he ſaith, <hi>knoweſt thou the Ordinances of heaven?</hi> the meaning may be this; <hi>Are the heavenly bodies diſpoſed or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered by thy wiſdome? haſt thou given them vertue to work upon inferiour bodies? I haſt thou made the ſtatutes by which they are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned, or by which they govern?</hi> That's the Lords Prerogative.</p>
                  <p>Hence note; Firſt,
<q>The heavens are under a law, they have their ſtatutes.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>They are under a law in a three-fold Reſpect. 1. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their motion, how and whither they ſhall move. 2ly. They are under a law as to their influences, where and on whom they ſhall drop them down. 3ly. (Which neceſſarily follows the former) They are under a law as to their effects and operations upon the Creatures, whether for good, or for evil. The heavens can neither hurt nor help us, but according to higher or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. This threefold law may be underſtood in that one Scripture (<hi>Jer.</hi> 31.35.) <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, which giveth the Sun for a light by day, and the ordinances of the Moon and of the Stars for a light by night.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note Secondly;
<q>What all the Laws and Ordinances of heaven are, is a ſecret to man.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Knoweſt thou them?</hi> ſaith God to <hi>Job.</hi> There are ſome Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of heaven, or ſome things for which heaven is ordained, which are eaſily and commonly known; ſuch are the changes of ſeaſons, with the diviſion of night and day, of winter and ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. There are alſo ſec et Ordinances and Orders given to the heavens, according to which they produce many unexpected and extraordinary <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Who knows theſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of heaven? and if theſe are ſo unknown? then we may conclude,</p>
                  <pb n="253" facs="tcp:48669:136"/>
                  <p>Firſt, If man know not ſuch like ſecret Ordinances of heaven, ſurely he is much leſs able to underſtand the ſecret counſels of heaven. We know but litle of thoſe things that are commonly ſeen and felt among us, but there are reſerves which we cannot know at all.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We may hence alſo conclude, If the heavens have their ſtatutes and Ordinances, as to their motion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then much more hath man ſtatutes and ordinances according to which he ſhould move. The heavens never move but according to ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances. Let us be ſure, that whatever we do,<note place="margin">à <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Some Aſtrologers give them a power of doing all on the earth, as if both our lives and livelihoods depended wholly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Aſpects of Planets: It is not this mans endeavour (ſay they) nor that mans skill, but all flows from the Stars. Theſe make or put the Heavens, which are Gods work, into the place of God himſelf; they put the heavens into the place of the God of Heaven. All things are in the hand of Heaven, ſay they. We ſay, All things, even the Planets themſelves, are in the hand, and at the diſpoſe of God. We grant, and this Text proves, that the Heavens have a great power upon the earth; we cannot but ſee and feel what the Sun doth upon the earth, we ſee, it diſtributes the year into four ſeaſons, Summer and Winter, Spring and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn; we ſee, it makes Equinoxes twice in the year, when days and nights are of an even length, and as many Solſtices, in one of which dayes are of greateſt length, and nights in the other. We ſee how the Sun brings forth ſeveral effects in thoſe ſeveral ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, even the generation or corruption of natural things. We know alſo, that as the North draws the Magnete or Load-ſtone, ſo the Sun, the <hi>Heliotrope,</hi> a flower ſo called, becauſe it follows the motion of the Sun. It is ſaid alſo, that the Sun hath a great power upon the Cock, who therefore croweth about midnight, as if he did then congratulate or welcom the return of the Sun from the Antipodes to our Hemiſphear. Though theſe inſtances are not demonſtrative or concluding, yet they are probable eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Heavens dominion in the earth.</p>
                  <p>Further, 'tis generally agreed, that the Moon hath a great Power upon the waters, cauſing the ebbing and flowing of the Sea; as alſo, upon thoſe inhabitants of the Sea, <hi>Shelfiſh,</hi> becauſe
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:48669:137"/> they are obſerved to increaſe with the increaſe of the Moon, and to decreaſe at the wane of it.</p>
                  <p>Nor may we deny the heavens have a dominion upon the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of men; for, though we ſubſcribe not to thoſe fancies of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtronomers, who have fixed a ſpecial ſtar as ruling the ſpecial parts of mans body, as you ſee in Almanacks; who tell us alſo, That in the body of man, the <hi>Sun</hi> anſwers the heart, <hi>Mars</hi> the gall, <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi> the liver, <hi>Mercury</hi> the mouth and tongue, <hi>Saturn</hi> the head; though (I ſay) we ſubſcribe not to theſe, no nor to thoſe other ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of theirs, who aſcribe a ſpecial dominion to the ſeven Planets over the ſeven ages or ſtages into which the courſe of mans life is commonly divided; that is, Firſt, Infancy to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of the <hi>Moon;</hi> Secondly, Childhood to <hi>Mercury;</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, You h to <hi>Venus;</hi> Fourthly, Adoleſcency or the young mans ſtate to the <hi>Sun;</hi> Fifthly, Compleat manhood to <hi>Mars;</hi> Sixthly, Old age to <hi>Jupiter;</hi> Seventhly, extream or decrepid old age to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn;</hi> yet doubtleſs the Stars have a great power upon the bodies of men, as well as upon Plants and all ſorts of Vegetables, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinately to the power and appointment of God, who ruleth all things and perſons according to the pleaſure and uncontroul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſoveraignty of his own will.</p>
                  <p>Again, Naturaliſts tell us (and many are not far from believing them) that the Planets have great power over minerals and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals; They ſay, Gold is under the dominion of the <hi>Sun,</hi> Silver of the <hi>Moon,</hi> Iron of <hi>Mars,</hi> Lead of <hi>Saturn;</hi> and that Tin and Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par are under the dominion of that Planet by them called <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> Now whether or no God hath ſet theſe metals under the peculiar dominion of theſe ſtars, I will not diſpute; not will I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that there may be a natural ſympathy and congeniality be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, nor that their influences may be very operative and effectual towards their gene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Only let us take heed that we be not found giving that to the Heavens which God hath not given them. Remember, the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion here intended of the heavens over the earth, is a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial, not a ſupream dominion; 'tis not, I dare ſay, any ſuch do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion as thoſe Aſtrologers cry up, who would perſwade or make us believe,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That the diſpoſitions and manners of all men are under the dominion of the Planets and Stars.</p>
                  <pb n="256" facs="tcp:48669:138"/>
                  <p>Secondly, That the very way and courſe of every mans life, is ordered by the dominion of Stars and Planets.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That all the ſucceſſes and events, good or bad, of mens actions and undertakings, depend upon the Stars and Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, (which ſome have adventured to affirm) That the riſe and fall of great perſons and families, together with the growths and declinings of whole Kingdoms and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, are under the dominion of the Stars.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, That the flouriſhings and decayings of Arts and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences depend upon them. Yea,</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, That the ſtars operate much towards the planting and progreſs, towards the rooting up or going back of Religion.</p>
                  <p>But this Scripture intends not any ſuch dominion of heaven over the earth: <hi>Moſes</hi> hath told us long ſince what this domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is (<hi>Gen.</hi> 1.14.) <hi>And God ſaid, let there be lights in the fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament of heaven, to divide the day from the night; and let them be for ſigns and for ſeaſons, and for days, and for years.</hi> The ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary lights or ſtars of heaven, are always for ordinary ſignes and ſeaſons; and ſometimes there are extraordinary lights ſeen in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or the ordinary are ſeen appearing in an extraordinary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to ſignifie that God is about to do extraordinary things, or to bring forth extraordinary times and ſeaſons.</p>
                  <p>So then, they who ſay the heavenly bodies have no power, or produce no effects upon the earth or earthly bodies, oppoſe not only the teſtimony of ſenſe and daily experience, but this, and other expreſs teſtimonies of Scripture. And as for thoſe who aſcribe all thoſe things before mentioned, or any one of them ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely to the dominion of the heavenly bodies or luminaries, they put them in the place of God himſelf, and overthrow the common foundations of Religion, which teacheth us to depend wholly upon God for all things, which teacheth us alſo to truſt in him alone, and to look upon his favour (not the favourable looks or aſpects of the Stars) as the fountain of all our good, as alſo to fear him and his diſpleaſure alone (not the diſpleaſed looks of the Stars) as the fountain of all penal evils.</p>
                  <p>Therefore let us in theſe things ſpeak and think according to ſobriety. All that I ſhall add for the concluſion of this Point, is,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Let us be warned and awakened by the ſignes of Heaven;
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:48669:138"/> but let us not be diſmayed at them; let us leave that to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, who know not God (<hi>Jer.</hi> 10.2.) or rather, let us pray, that the Heathen may no longer be left under that blindneſs and bondage.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If any would know what ſhall come to paſs, or would acquaint themſelves with future events, whether with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to perſons or Nations, let them not go to, nor conſult Star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazers, but the holy Scriptures, the Word of God; for he hath given us a written word, wherein as in a glaſs, we may ſee,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, What God would have us to do, and how to order the whole courſe of our lives.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, What good, what bleſſings, what ſucceſſes, we are like to have or may expect through his free favour to us in Chriſt, we walking humbly, holily, believingly before him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, What evils, what croſſes, what curſes, what miſeries, what miſchances (as we ſpeak) we are ſubject to, and may fear, if we walk proudly, impenitently, frowardly, in the way of our own hearts. We need not go to the Stars if we would know what is like to befal us in this life; let us conſult the Promiſes, and they will tell us what good we ſhall receive, if we believe and obey; let us go to the threatnings, and they will tell us what evils will be our portion, if we are unbelieving and diſobedient. Let us fear God, not the Stars; let our hope be in God, not in the Stars. If we are evil, and do evil, the moſt auſpicious conjunctions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigne and promiſing appearances of the Stars in our nativity, will never produce us any true good; and if we are good, and do good, their moſt inauſpitious, harſh and threatning appearances ſhall do us no hurt: It needs not trouble us under what Star we were born, if we are new born. One being told, that the Stars in power, or which had the dominion in his birth, bare him no good will, anſwered, <hi>I care not for that, I have had a ſecond birth. Do not my words</hi> (ſaith the Lord, <hi>Mic.</hi> 2.7.) <hi>do good to him that walketh uprightly?</hi> doubtleſs they do, and ſo they will, let the Stars do their worſt. Let us ſit down quietly in this aſſurance, That whatſoever rule or dominion Heaven hath in the earth, the dominion of God is over, and over-ruleth the Heavens.</p>

                  <p>IN the context of theſe five Verſes, return is made to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teors of Heaven. The Lord having queſtioned <hi>Job</hi> about the Stars, thoſe pure heavenly bodies, the <hi>Pleiades, Orion, Mazza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roth, and Arcturus with his Sons;</hi> here puts the queſtion afreſh about the aireal bodies, or the natural works of God in the Air.

The words are plain, and the ſcope of them obvious, even to convince <hi>Job</hi> yet further of his inability and frailty; or that he ought to leave God to the government of the world, to the government of Perſons, Families, and Nations, for as much as himſelf was not able to govern a cloud, nor to order out the leaſt ſhower of rain.</p>
                  <p>Hence Note;
<q>Man hath no abſolute or ſoveraign power over any creature.</q>

                  <p>Clouds will not be commanded, cannot be commanded, by the greateſt and mightieſt of the ſons of men. <hi>Job</hi> was a great Prince himſelf, yet he could not, neither can the greateſt Princes of the world command a ſhower nor a drop of rain to fall from the heavens. Man cannot command the clouds to rain, either when he will, or where he will, or how much he will; theſe
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:48669:140"/> powers belong to God alone. Yet in one ſen e man may lift up his voice to the clouds, and abundance of waters will cover him. There is a twofold voice of man? Fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſt, A command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing voice; And ſecondly, A praying voice. Let man lift up his commanding voice to the clouds, as long as he will he ſhall get down no rain, but if man by faith lift up his praying voice to the clouds, that is, to God, in whoſe hand the clouds are, he may get rain, yea, abundance of waters to cover him. (<hi>Zach.</hi> 10.1.) <hi>A k ye of the Lord rain, in the time of the latter rain, ſo the Lord ſhall make bright clouds, and give them ſhowers of rain, to every one graſs in the field.</hi> At the voice of man humbly praying, the Lord makes <hi>bright clouds;</hi> or (as our Margin hath it) <hi>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, both for man and beaſt. This was one of the caſes which <hi>Solomon</hi> put in his prayer, at the dedication of the Temple for the Lords anſwering of prayer. (1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.35.) <hi>When heaven is ſhut up, and there is no rain, becauſe they have ſinned againſt thee; if they pray towards this place, and confeſs thy name, and turn from their ſins when thou afflicteſt them; then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the ſin of thy ſervants,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and give rain upon thy land.</hi> When the clouds are lockt up, when they are as braſs over our heads, prayer moves the Lord to open them, or to melt them down into ſhowers, for the refreſhing and fructifying of the earth. The Apoſtle <hi>James (Chap.</hi> 5.17, 18.) tells us, that <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>lias</hi> covered the earth with abundance of rain, by lifting up his voice in prayer. <hi>Elias (ſaith he) was a man ſubject to like paſſions as we are, and he prayed earneſtly that it might not rain, and it rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not on the earth by the ſpace of three years and ſix months: And he prayed again, and the heavens gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit.</hi> The holy hiſtory makes the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port (1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18 45.) <hi>And it came to paſs in the mean while that the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain,</hi> &amp;c. If we would have rain, we muſt ask for it, and lift up a praying voice to God, who commands the clouds; it is a vain thing for us to lift up a voice to the clouds in our own name, to command them to give us rain in the ſeaſon of it.</p>
                  <p>And as this is true of the clouds and rain, ſo of all creatures,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:48669:140"/> Their powers and vertues, their efficacies and influences are not at our command, but if we look up to God and wait upon him in prayer, he can command them all to give out their vertues both to ſerve our neceſſities and accommodate our delights. Now, as in this queſtion God ſhews <hi>Job</hi> his inſufficiency to command water, ſo in the next to command fire from the clouds.</p>

As if the Lord had ſaid; <hi>Canſt thou ſend forth the lightnings, and will they return to thee, and ſay, we have done thy commands, and here we are again to receive freſh commands, or new orders from thee?</hi> Surely, as the rain will not thus obey thee, ſo neither will the lightnings, neither the one nor the other will be thy ſervants, to go of thy errand, or execute thy will.</p>
                  <p>The ſame note which I gave before concerning the rain, might be taken up here again concerning the lightnings, <hi>They are not under the command of man,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, for as much as the Lord here denies this priviledge, both reſpecting the rain and lightning unto man, he would have us underſtand and know that both are in himſelf; though you cannot, yet I can command them, both are under my dominion. While the Lord ſhews <hi>Job</hi> his impotency to command theſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teors, he aſſerts his own omnipotency; as he hath made them, ſo he can rule them.</p>
                  <p>Hence obſerve;
<q>All treatures, even thoſe which ſeem to be moſt out of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, are fully under the command of God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>What, to appearance, is more out of command than the lightning, that quick, that piercing, that fierce and fiery crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet that ſtirs no more than a ſtone, till the Lord commands; and at his command it ſtirs, and is gone in a moment. <hi>The Lord God hath ſpoken</hi> (ſaith the Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> 3.8.) <hi>who can but propheſie?</hi> And as a faithful Prophet cannot but prophecy, ſo the not only faithleſs, but ſenſeleſs creatures cannot but do what God hath ſpoken. That of the <hi>Pſalmiſt (Pſal.</hi> 104.4.) which we read, <hi>who maketh his Angels ſpirits, his Miniſters a flaming fire;</hi> ſome render thus, <hi>who maketh the winds his meſſengers, and the flames of fire his miniſters.</hi> That is, he uſeth tempeſtuous winds and flames of fire as his meſſengers and miniſters. The ſame Hebrew word that ſignifieth <hi>an Angel,</hi> ſignifieth <hi>a Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> at large, and the ſame word that ſignifieth <hi>a Spirit,</hi> ſignifieth alſo <hi>the Wind.</hi> And as the words, ſo the truth will bear both tranſlations or conſtructions; for as thoſe higher or higheſt of ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional creatures, the Angels; ſo thoſe high inanimate creatures, the winds and lightnings, which may properly be called <hi>flames of
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:48669:141"/> fire,</hi> are the Miniſters and meſſengers of God; that is, they go forth and Miniſter according to his Word, they ſay, <hi>Here we are.</hi> The Lord by a call or word ſpeaking can have whom and what he will to ſerve his purpoſe, and fulfil his decrees. It is ſaid (2 <hi>King.</hi> 8.1. as alſo, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105.16.) <hi>The Lord called for a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi> a famine of bread; and he no ſooner called, but the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine came, and ſaid, <hi>Here am I;</hi> the famine preſently brake the ſtaff of bread, and did eat up all the good of the Land. The Prophet <hi>Haggai</hi> (Chap. 1.11.) repreſents the Lord, ſaying, I <hi>called for a drought</hi> (which is the uſual fore-runner of famine) and the drought ſaid, <hi>Here am I;</hi> it came preſently as ſoon as the Lord commanded. On the other hand, when the Lord made many promiſes under the new Covenant, among other things, he ſaid, <hi>I will call for plenty</hi> (Ezek. 36.29.) <hi>I will call for the corn, and will increaſe it, and lay no famine upon you.</hi> As in thoſe other places he called for famine and drought, ſo here he ſaith, I will <hi>call for plenty,</hi> and it ſhall ſay, <hi>Here am I;</hi> abundance of corn and graſs, and fruits of the earth came at that call. Lamenting <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſpeaking of the woful captivity of the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſaith (<hi>Lam.</hi> 1.15.) <hi>The Lord called an aſſembly againſt me,</hi> that is, I conceive, an aſſembly of the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> and <hi>Babylonians,</hi> an aſſembly of men, an army of men; he cauſed them to aſſemble and come together; he did but call, and they ſaid, <hi>Here we are,</hi> and we will go vex <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Thus, if the Lord call for famine and drought, if he call for an aſſembly of men, for men aſſembled with the ſword of war in their hand, to puniſh and chaſtiſe any people for their ſin; they will ſurely come and do his pleaſure: whatever the Lord calls for, cannot but come. Take this inference from it;
<q>If the Lord have ſuch a command upon all creatures, even the inanimate creatures; if the lightnings anſwer him when he calls, <hi>Here we are,</hi> Then how readily ſhould men, the beſt of viſible creatures anſwer his call and ſay, <hi>Here we are?</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>When the Lord ſaid to <hi>Abraham (Gen.</hi> 12.1.) <hi>Get thee out of thy Country, and from thy Kindred, and from thy Fathers houſe, unto a Land that I ſhall ſhew thee,</hi> he never diſputed the caſe, but (ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.8.) <hi>Obeyed and went out, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whither he went.</hi> He never enquired what the place was to
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:48669:142"/> which he was to go, nor what accommodations he ſhould find when he came thither: <hi>Abraham</hi> knew he was to go whither God called him to go, though whither he was to go he knew not. And when long after this the Lord called to <hi>Abraham (Gen.</hi> 22.1.) he ſaid, <hi>Behold, here I am;</hi> or, <hi>Behold me;</hi> as if he had ſaid, Lord, I am here ready to obey thy command, to go of thy errand, to carry whatever meſſage thou ſhalt put into my mouth, to do whatever work thou ſhalt put into my hand; and that <hi>Abraham</hi> did not complement with God, it appears in the ſame Chapter; for though when God commanded him to offer up <hi>his Son, his only Son</hi> Iſaac, <hi>whom he loved,</hi> every word was enough to wound his heart, &amp; the laſt deepeſt (to part with a Son is hard, with an only Son har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, with a ſon dearly beloved, is hardeſt of all, eſpecially when he muſt be not only paſſive but active in this loſs, &amp; his own hand muſt give the parting blow) yet <hi>Abraham</hi> being called to this hard and hot ſervice, ſaid, <hi>Here am I,</hi> and readily obeyed. This readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs at the call of God, <hi>David</hi> profeſſed from his own experience (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.8.) <hi>When thou ſaidſt, ſeek ye my face, my heart ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, thy face Lord will I ſeek.</hi> That is, as thou haſt comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that I ſhould worſhip thee, ſo I do; or, what thou, O Lord, ſayeſt, is my deſire; thy command is not only the reſolution, but the requeſt and ſupplication of my ſoul. We have the like readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of that holy Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> who (after the Angel with a coal from the Altar had touched his lips, and cleanſed him from his filthineſs) hearing the Lord enquire for a meſſenger, <hi>Whom ſhall I ſend?</hi> preſently anſwered (as the lightning in the Text) <hi>Here am I, ſend me (Iſ.</hi> 6.8.) Lord, I am ready to go whitherſoever thou wilt ſend me. This ſhould be, &amp;, in ſome meaſure is the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of all believers; though they may have, &amp; to their ſorrow, find many reluctancies and ſtops, yet this is in the heart of every true believer, to be ready at the call of God, &amp; to ſay, <hi>Here I am.</hi> When the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> had a call to preach the goſpel of Chriſt, which once he perſecuted, <hi>Immediately</hi> (ſaith he, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.16.) <hi>I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred not with fleſh and blood;</hi> he made no delayes, much leſs any excuſes, leaſt of all any d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nials, but <hi>was obedient to the heavenly Viſion.</hi> As ſoon as he had that viſion and call from God to go and preach the Goſpel, he never ſtood reaſoning and conferring with fleſh and blood, he put no queſtions, he asked not this or that mans opinion, whether it were beſt for him to go or not; neither
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:48669:142"/> did he confer with the fleſh and blood in his own heart, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred not with himſelf, he conſulted not his own ſafety, nor any carnal intereſts, but did as he was commanded. And unleſs we do thus, not only will the ordinary practiſe of ſervants to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters riſe up in judgement againſt us (<hi>Mat.</hi> 8.9. <hi>I am a man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der authority</hi> (ſaid the Centurion) <hi>having ſoldiers under me;</hi> I have a ſuperior officer, and I have inferior ſoldiers, <hi>and I ſay to one go, and he goeth; and to another come, and he cometh:</hi> Such is or ought to be the carriage of ſoldiers and ſervants towards their Superiors. Now I ſay, unleſs we readily obey the voice of God, not only will the daily practiſe of ſervants, but the practiſe (if I may ſo ſpeak) of the lightnings from the clouds, will riſe up in judgement againſt us and condemn us. Shall a ſervant ſay, <hi>Here I am,</hi> at the call of man? Shall the lightning ſay, <hi>here I am,</hi> at the call of God? and ſhall not man ſay ſo at Gods call? Shall men put queſtions to Gods commands? Shall they query, <hi>Will the world bear it if I do this? or, will this ſtand with my eaſe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, with my credit or commodity, when God requires it?</hi> If any do ſo, the lightning may flaſh in the face of their conſciences, and not only blaſt them as ſtubborn and diſobedient, but brand them for fooliſh and unwiſe, or, at leaſt, for want of wiſdom; about which the queſtion is put to <hi>Job</hi> in the next verſe.</p>

                  <p>Some Interpreters conceive, that at this verſe the Lord enters diſcourſe with, or begins to queſtion <hi>Job</hi> concerning living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and beginning here with man, the chiefeſt of viſible li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving creatures, he proceeds to inferior living creatures, the beaſts of the earth, and the fowls of the air, as followeth in the 39<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter: Yet the very next verſe offers a great objection againſt this opinion; for there return is made to the former mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the works of nature.

                  <p>And therefore I rather conceive, that this 36th verſe is to be joyned with the two former already opened; as if here the Lord would convince man, that as he hath not power ſufficient to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:48669:143"/> ſo not wiſdom enough to diſpoſe, either of the Rain or of the Lightnings; under which, by a <hi>Synechdoche,</hi> all other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures may be comprehended. As if God had ſaid, <hi>Whatever wiſdom man hath, is of my putting into him; now I have not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him wiſdom enough, nor taught him how to order and diſpoſe the clouds and lightnings; and if I have not given him wiſdom for theſe things, whence ſhould he have it?</hi> So then, according to this way of interp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſt, Seeing wiſdom, both that which is planted in man, as a rational creature, and that alſo which man acquires by induſtry, is of God, <hi>Then God knoweth how wiſe any man is, and what any mans wiſdom amounts to.</hi> God can eaſily compaſs the wiſeſt man in the world. The wiſdom of ſome men is beyond the compaſs of many men; but the wiſdom of all men, is infinitely within the compaſs of God. He that hath put wiſdom into man, is him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf wiſer than all men. Thus <hi>David</hi> argued (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 94.9.) <hi>He that planted the ear, ſhall not he hear? and he that formed the eye, ſhall he not ſee?</hi> doubtleſs he doth. God hath made ſight and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and therefore the ſeeing and the hearing powers are tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendently in God. And as it followeth (<hi>verſ.</hi> 10.) <hi>He that teacheth man knowledge, ſhall not he underſtand?</hi> certainly he doth. He underſtands and knows, not only what men underſtand and know, but he underſtands how much underſtanding, and what knowledge any man hath; God looks through all.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If God hath put wiſdom into man, <hi>then he can take wiſdom from man, he can deſtroy the wiſdom of the wiſe,</hi> he can turn the wiſdom of an <hi>Achithophel</hi> into fooliſhneſs. As he can make a fool wiſe, ſo he can make a wiſe man a fool, or befool the wiſeſt men.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If all wiſdom be of the Lords putting in, <hi>then let none be proud of their wiſdom.</hi> There is nothing that we are ſo apt to be proud of as of our wiſdom. If we have but better na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:48669:144"/> parts than others, we are preſently lifted up above others; if we have better acquirements than others, we are apt to be proud of our ſelves. A little knowledge puffeth up, and indeed that which puffeth up is but a little. True wiſdom, though great, doth not puff up, for that leads us to him that gives us wiſdom, and that will keep us humble.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, We may infer, <hi>if the Lord hath put wiſdom into man, then man ought to be thankful to the Lord for the wiſdom he hath.</hi> As man ſhould not be p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oud of his wiſdom, becauſe how much ſoever he hath, he hath received it; ſo man ought to be very thankful for wiſdom, becauſe how much or how little ſoever it is he hath received it. If all receipts from God call for thanks, how much more this receipt of wiſdom? which, next to grace, is the moſt precious thing we receive from him, and is it ſelf ſometimes put for grace.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>If wiſdom be of Gods putting into man? then let men be careful to uſe their wiſdom for God.</hi> That ſtock which another man hath put into our hands, he expects we ſhould uſe it for him; eſpecially, that we ſhould not uſe it againſt him, or to his diſadvantage. How wicked are they, who are ſo far from uſing their wiſdom for God, that they uſe it againſt God, that is, againſt his intereſt, truth, and ſervants. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſaid (<hi>Exod.</hi> 1.10.) <hi>Come on, let us deal wiſely with them.</hi> And what was it for, but to vex and enſlave Gods <hi>firſt born,</hi> the people of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> He that imploys his wiſdom to any evil purpoſe, imployeth it againſt God, and ſo armes himſelf with what he hath received from God to reſiſt God: Wo to thoſe who do ſo. Wiſdom is of Gods giving; uſe it then for him, and dedicate it to him; above all, take heed of uſing it againſt him. It had been better for that man that he had been a bruit, than that he ſhould be ſo brutiſh, as to imploy his underſtanding and reaſon againſt God.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, If the Lord hath put wiſdom into man; <hi>Then man muſt be accountable to God for his wiſdom,</hi> as alſo for all the other talents which he hath received. Wiſdom is a great talent; they who are ſo wiſe as to know what that means, will uſe it trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blingly, that they may give their account rejoycingly. They are wiſe indeed who daily conſider, whence or from whom they had their wiſdom, and before whom they muſt come to a reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:48669:145"/> what they have done with it, even before him who hath put all their wiſdome into them. <hi>Who hath put wiſdom into the inward parts?</hi>

                  <q>Or who hath given underſtanding to the heart?</q>

That's the force of the word which here we render <hi>heart.</hi>

The reaſon of this tranſlation is this, becauſe the ſame word which ſignifieth a bottle, ſignifies alſo a muſical inſtrument ſomewhat reſembling the form of a bottle (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.2.) Thus ſome take it here, as intending that muſical or melodious har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, which antient Philoſophers have affi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Sober men following this tranſlation, <hi>who can ſtay the muſick of heaven?</hi> underſtand by it only the harmonious concord and agreement, which all the heavenly Orbes unfailably obſerve in their ſeveral courſes, without the leaſt jarr or diſcord. That's a truth, ſhewing the great wiſdom and power of God, who hath put the heavens into ſuch a ſweet order, that they move, not only conſtantly, but harmoniouſly. Though the motion of the heavens makes no audible or proper muſick, yet it makes an intelligible or metaphorical muſick, that is, the heavens move orderly, there is an agreement in their motion, which is the the ſweeteſt muſick in heaven among Saints and Angels, and among good men on earth. We ſay of men moving peaceably in their places, as becomes them, there is a harmony among them. And how bleſſed a thing would it be, to ſee all ſorts of men moving orderly in their ſpheres? what a harmony would it make, to ſee every one do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his duty, and doing it in his place? whereas to omit duty, makes our lives uſeleſs; and to do it out of our place, makes us troubleſome and unharmonious. And therefore, though I inſiſt not upon this reading, yet it were well if all would inſiſt upon the moral of it, labouring to make harmony (as much as may be) in all their motions. But I paſs from it, and reſt in our own,</p>

                     <hi>Who can ſtay the bottles of heaven,</hi> that is, who can make them leave raining? The Lord by a late queſtion convinced <hi>Job</hi> that no man can make it rain (<hi>verſ.</hi> 34.) <hi>Canſt thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, that abundance of waters may cover thee?</hi> and by this queſtion he would convince him, that no man can obſtruct or hinder the rain. <hi>Who can ſtay the bottles of heaven?</hi>

                  <p>Hence obſerve,
<q>It is God who ſtayeth or reſtraineth the clouds from raining.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Should not the Lord put ſtopples into thoſe bottles? ſhould not he cloſe up thoſe barrels, they would drop down continually? and in ſtead of watering, drown the earth.

<pb n="275" facs="tcp:48669:147"/> who could ſtop or ſtay them?

                  <p>The Margin of our Bibles gives us the former part of the <hi>verſe</hi> in a very different tranſlation, thus, <hi>When the duſt is turned into mire.</hi> The earth hath had its fill, if not too much rain, when the duſt is turned into mire? And when 'tis ſo, who but God ſtayeth the bottles of heaven from pouring down over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much?</p>
                  <p>But I ſhall only open the reading in the Text, of which there are two interpretations.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Some expound it of ſtaying the rain when there is moſt need of rain, or when the earth wants it moſt, or in a time of drought: For then the earth groweth hard like a molten-pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and the clods thereof cleaving one to another make clefts in the body of the earth. In a time of great drought, the earth at once cleaves aſunder, and runs cloſet together, as it were to ſuccour it ſelf. Who ſtayeth the bottles of heaven, when the earth is chapt and gapes for rain to ſoften and cool it? Surely man doth it not, nor can he be ſaid to do it (unleſs <hi>meritoriouſly</hi>) It is God alone who <hi>efficiently</hi> ſtays the clouds from rain in a time of drought, or when the neceſſities of the earth call aloud for it. Taking the words in this ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve;
<q>God can ſtop any of our mercies (as here the rain) when we have moſt need of them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I</hi> (ſaith the Lord <hi>Amos</hi> 4.7.) <hi>have withholden the rain from you when there were yet three months to the harveſt, and I cauſed it to rain upon one City, and cauſed it not to rain upon another City; one piece was rained upon, and the piece whereupon it rained not,

                  <p>Rain falling upon the duſt embodies it. The ground moulders in a time of drought; but when rain comes, that hardens it.

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> then the earth, which like a heap of ſand would not hang together, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes ſolid and fit for tillage. Now when ſo much rain hath fallen as prepares the earth, and (as the word imports) fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates or levens it to receive the ſeed caſt into it, then, <hi>who ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the bottles of heaven?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note, Firſt,
<q>Rain compacts the earth.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>As moiſture looſens compacted things, ſo it compacts or knit, together looſe things. The earth is ſoon made duſt by droughts, and it would be a very duſt-heap, if it had no moiſture to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unite it. The Lord threatens his people, in caſe of diſobedience
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:48669:148"/> (<hi>Deut.</hi> 28.24.) to <hi>make the rain of their Land powder and duſt;</hi> that is, they ſhould have duſt and powder, inſtead of water. Long drought turns the earth to duſt. In this learn, how great a mercy there is in rain.</p>
                  <p>Secondly note,
<q>The Lord knows when the earth hath had ſufficient rain.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore (unleſs in judgement) he will not let the clouds run waſt; he will ſtay his bottles from letting down one drop more, when once the duſt (by rain falling upon it) <hi>groweth into hardneſs, and the clods cleave faſt together.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note Thirdly,
<q>'Tis a mercy, when the earth hath enough, that God ſtops the bottles.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>As it is a duty, when we have drank enough, to <hi>ſtop the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,</hi> that is, to give over drinking; ſo 'tis a mercy, that the Lord ſtops the bottles when the earth hath drank enough. When the earth hath enough, the Lord ſometimes will not ſtop the bottles of heaven, but lets them pour down rain, till the fruits of the earth are utterly ſpoyled; and this he doth for the puniſhment of mans ſin always, and ſometimes for the puniſhment of thoſe ſpecial ſins, mans unthankfulneſs for, and abuſe of the fruits of the earth; that is, becauſe he did not ſtay the bottle, when he had taken enough.</p>
                  <p>Now, if the Lord knows when to give rain, and when to ſtop it, with reſpect to husbandry, and the natural fruits of the earth, then doubtleſs he knows and will take care to give rain for the ſouls of his people, when they have need. (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.2.) <hi>Thou, O God, didſt ſend a plentiful rain, whereby thou didſt confirm thine inheritance, when it was weary;</hi> which is ſpecially meant of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual rain. There are bottles of heaven which water ſouls. The Preachers of the word are thoſe bottles or clouds, which hold and deſtil the myſtical rain; &amp; the Lord will not ſtop them, till he ſees the hearts of men made fit to bring forth the fruits of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs &amp; holineſs; he will not ſtop (I ſay) that ſpiritual rain, till this be effected, unleſs in judgement to a people, that have deſpiſed the rain, and ſlighted thoſe ſhowers of divine doctrine; againſt ſuch the Lord will ſtop the bottles of heaven, &amp; then their ſouls turn to duſt,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:48669:149"/> and their hearts become hard as rocks, or like the mountains, upon which neither rain nor dew falls, fruitleſs and barren of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good word and work.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, About the beaſts of the earth.</p>

                  <p>Thirdly, About the fiſh of the Sea.</p>
                  <p>The Lord gives particular inſtance, or makes inquiry about thirteen kinds of living creatures; whereof ſeven abide upon the earth, five in the air, one in the waters.</p>
                  <p>The ſeven creatures inquired about, which abide on the earth, are, Firſt, The <hi>Lion;</hi> Secondly, The <hi>wilde Goat;</hi> Thirdly, The <hi>Hind;</hi> Fourthly, The <hi>wilde Aſs;</hi> Fifthly, The <hi>

                  <p>The five creatures inquired about, that live in the air, are, Firſt, The <hi>Raven;</hi> Secondly, The <hi>Peacock;</hi> Thirdly, The <hi>Oſtrich;</hi> Fourthly, The <hi>Hawk;</hi> and, Fifthly, The <hi>Eagle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of the third ſort, namely, ſuch as live in the water, or in the
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:48669:149"/> Sea, <hi>Job</hi> is queſtioned only about one, the <hi>Leviathan,</hi> or the <hi>Whale,</hi> a creature of a vaſt magnitude; of ſo vaſt a magnitude, that take all the other twelve creatures and joyn them together, the <hi>Leviathan</hi> exceeds them all in magnitude; as will appear in the deſcription given of him at large, in the one and fortieth Chapter.</p>
                  <p>The Lord in this latter diſcourſe with, or queſtioning of <hi>Job,</hi> ſeems to deſcend, or to put matter of eaſier reſolution to him than he had done before, and doubtleſs he doth; yet he doth it for the greater and fuller conviction and humiliation of <hi>Job.</hi> As if the Lord had ſaid, <hi>If (O</hi> Job) <hi>thou findeſt thy ſelf puzled and unable to give any tolerable anſwer and reſolution to the queſtions which I have propoſed, about the whole bulk or body of the earth and Sea, or about thoſe great things that are wrought in the heavens, and in the air, then conſider, how thou art able to anſwer my queſtions about theſe leſſer things, which are alſo near unto thee, the beaſts of the earth, fowls of the air, and the fiſh of the Sea.</hi> The Lord even in theſe works, makes manifeſt his glorious perfections, far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding the reach and apprehenſion of man, as well as in, yea more than in, thoſe other works of his mentioned before.</p>
                  <p>There are two things eſpecially, of which the Lord would convince <hi>Job,</hi> with reſpect to theſe living creatures:</p>

                  <p>Secondly, Of his power and wiſdom, in the extraordinary ſtrength and ſtrange qualities which he hath beſtowed upon them, and indued them with; in ſome of which they much ſurpaſs man, the maſter-piece, and maſter of the whole inviſible Creation.</p>

The Prophet (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 31.4.) compares Chriſt to a Lion, that will not be frighted; <hi>Like as the Lion</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and the young Lion roaring on his prey; when a multitude of Shepherds is called out againſt him, he will not be afraid of their voice, nor abaſe himſelf for the noiſe of them; ſo ſhall the Lord of Hoſts himſelf come down to fight for mount</hi> Sion, <hi>and for the hill thereof.</hi> As if the Prophet had ſaid, God will protect <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> againſt all her enemies (the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> forces are there ſpecially intended) no more regarding or fearing them, than a fierce Lion in the prime of his ſtrength, will regard or fear a company of ſimple Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds, that ſhall attempt to reſcue his prey from between his teeth.

                  <p>Poſſibly the Lord ſpeaks of <hi>filling the appetite of young Lions</hi> becauſe young Lions have appetites ſo ſtrong, that a ſmall matter will not fill them. Young ones of any kind, have ſtronger ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites than thoſe that are old; young Lions eſpecially, whoſe conſtitution (ſay Naturaliſts) is very hot and dry: that being the temperament of Lions; young Lions muſt needs require a great proportion of food to ſatisfie their ſtomack, and find work for their quick concoction. 'Tis but a while, that the milk of the Lioneſs will ſerve their turn, they muſt have ſtronger meat; young Lions are ſoon ready for prey; 'Tis ſaid (<hi>Judg.</hi> 14.5.) that when <hi>Samſon</hi> paſſed by, <hi>a young Lion roared againſt him,</hi> or (as the Margin reads it) <hi>a young Lion meeting him roared;</hi> and why did he roar? not ſo much for anger, as for hunger, deſiring to make a prey of <hi>Sampſon.</hi>

                  <p>There is no work ſpoken of that the Lion doth to get his liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by, there's nothing ſpoken of any ſervice the Lion doth, all his care is for his belly, <hi>he hunts his prey:</hi> Wicked men in this are like Lions, they are like <hi>Nimrod,</hi> all for hunting, all for catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the prey. The Prophet <hi>Nahum (Chap.</hi> 2.12.) deſcribes the oppreſſing power of <hi>Nineveh,</hi> by a Lion <hi>tearing in pieces enough for his Whelpes, and ſtrangling for his Lioneſſes, and filling his holes with prey, and his dens with ravin.</hi> Tearing and ſtrangling, filling all with prey and ravin, is all that Lions do; not is the work of oppreſſors and cruel men any other in their kind,<note place="margin">Baſil.

Some of the Antients ſpeaking of the Lion, ſay, that when he roareth, the poor Beaſts that are within hearing are ſo amazed and affrighted, that though they might eſcape by flight, yet they ſtand ſtill and yield themſelves up to him for a prey.

                  </p>

That is alſo the concluſion which the Spirit of God made, by the wiſeſt and one of the mighteſt men that ever was in the world, King <hi>Solomon (Eccleſ.</hi> 9.11.) <hi>The race is not to the ſwift, nor the battle to the ſtrong, neither yet bread to the wiſe, nor yet riches to men of underſtanding, nor yet favour to men of skill, but time and chance happeneth to them all:</hi> though men have ſutable qualities and abilities for the attaining of their ends (what ſutes better the winning of a race than ſwiftneſs?) yet they cannot attain them, without the power and preſence of God in ſome kind and degree or o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>There's a ſpecial providence of God over them that have ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial need. The old Lion, that once could, but now cannot the young Lions that never could hunt the prey, are yet provided for.

                  <p>Fourthly, From the latter words, <hi>wilt thou fill the appetite of the young Lions?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note,
<q>God can and doth provide for the creature to fulneſs or ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; <hi>he fills their appetite.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>God, as I may ſay, keeps a good, a bountiful houſe for all his creatures; the young Lions that have ſuch ſtrong ſtomacks ſhall have their fill: Hence we may inferr.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, If the Lord doth thus provide for Lions young or old, one or other, then much more will he provide, and hunt the prey for his faithful people. <hi>David (Pſal.</hi> 34.10.) gives us the Lords word for it, <hi>The young Lions do lack and ſuffer hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but they that ſeek the Lord ſhall not want any good thing.</hi> That is, the young Lions may lack, or though the young Lions ſhould lack and ſuffer hunger, yet they that ſeek and ſerve the Lord ſhall not. Lions have a good aſſurance that they ſhall not lack, but the ſervants of God have a far better aſſurance that they ſhall not. <hi>Doth God take care for Oxen?</hi> was the Apoſtles queſtion (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.9.) <hi>or ſaith he it altogether for our ſakes; for our ſakes</hi> (ſpeaking of Goſpel Miniſters) <hi>no doubt this is written, (ver.</hi> 10.) As if he had ſaid, if the Lord did not give that law to the <hi>Jews, Thou ſhalt not muzzle the mouth of the Oxe that treadeth out the corn</hi> altogether for our ſakes, yet queſtionleſs he gave it chiefly for our ſakes, and had a far greater reſpect to us in making that law than to Oxen. Thus from the text and point in hand, I may ſay, <hi>Doth God take care for Lions?</hi> Surely, he hath cauſed this to be written, that we may know, he will much more
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:48669:154"/> take care of his ſheep, of all that fear him and call upon his name. A Lion may come into a ſtarving condition, but thoſe that fear God ſhall not. Lions, though they are very ſtrong &amp; ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle cannot always get their prey, but the Lord hath promiſed to miniſter to his people, at leaſt a ſupply of their neceſſities; as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not ſeen the righteous forſaken, nor his ſeed begging bread (Pſal.</hi> 37.25.)</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Doth the Lord provide to ſatisfaction for the young Lions? doth he fill their natural appetite? then ſurely, he will p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And what are the good things he fills them with? doubtleſs, ſpiritual good things; they ſhall have not only ſome taſts of theſe good things, but their fill of them; <hi>he fills the hungry with good things. (Pſal.</hi> 81.10.) <hi>Open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.</hi> God hath much reſpect to fill us with outward good things; but much more to fill us with ſpi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>This Verſe gives a further diſcription of the Lion, whether young or old. Before we had them hunting abroad in the fields, here we have them couching in their dens, and abiding in their covert.</p>

                  <p>This couching or bowing down in their dens, may be upon a three-fold account, and ſo there is a three-fold interpretation of the words.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Some taking the Lion for the old Lion and the young Lions for ſuch as are very young, interpret this couching as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from weakneſs; they couch in their dens, as not being able to go abroad.</p>

                  <p>As if they were aſleep, as if they minded nothing but their eaſe; yet even then they are buſily minding how to catch their prey. As if the Lord had ſaid, <hi>Haſt thou</hi> (O Job) <hi>taught the Lion that art and cunning, to lye couchant in his den, that he may ſteal upon beaſts paſſant, and ſurprize them unawares.

                  <p>The word rendred <hi>Covert</hi> ſignifieth a <hi>Tabernacle</hi> or Tent in which men abode for a time, and is therefore here oppoſed (as ſome conceive) to the Lions dens or houſes ſpoken of in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the <hi>verſe.</hi> Beaſts (ſay they) are aware of Lions dens, and ſo avoid them; but they may paſs unawares by the coverts and thickets, where they lye in ambuſh.

When the Lion came forth of his covert, there was a howling and a cry made; why ſo? the Lion came forth to deſtroy both ſheep and ſhepherds. Thus the Lord comes forth, even as a young Lion, full of wrath and fury to deſtroy the wicked: He is ſometimes like a Lion couching in his den, and abiding in his covert, but he doth it as the Lion,

                  <p>Secondly, Taking the Lion as politickly abiding in covert, and waiting for his prey;</p>
                  <p>Obſerve,
<q>As the Lord gives much ſtrength, ſo much craft to ſome creatures.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are creatures of little ſtrength which have much craft, others have little craft but much ſtrength, in ſome both meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; and among them we may number the Lion, he is a crafty one as well as a ſtrong one; he hath his covert, there he waits for his prey. We may parallel men with beaſts in this regard; among them ſome are ſtrong but not crafty, others are crafty but not ſtrong, and not a few are both. Such <hi>David</hi> compared to a Lion (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.4, 8, 9.) <hi>The wicked through the pride of his countenance will not ſeek after God:</hi> What will he ſeek after then? the 8th. and 9th. <hi>verſes</hi> tell us, <hi>He ſitteth in the lurking places of the villages, in the ſecret places doth he murder the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, his eyes are privily ſet againſt the poor, he lieth in wait ſecretly, as a Lion in his den, he lyeth in wait to catch the poor, he doth catch the poor when he draweth him into his net: He croucheth and humbleth himſelf, that the poor may fall by his ſtrong ones.</hi> Thus the ſubtle practices of a wicked man are ſet forth, by the ſubtlety of the Lion. He coucheth and croucheth, he waits for the innocent, he draws him into his net; he firſt entangles him, and then devours him. <hi>David</hi> gives a like deſcription of evil men in another place (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.11, 12.) <hi>They have now compaſſed us in our ſteps, they have ſet their eyes bowing down to the earth; like as a Lion that is greedy of his prey, and as it were a young Lion lurking in ſecret places.</hi> Theſe Scriptures plainly ſhew the natural ſubtlety of the Lion, waiting in his covert that he may do miſchief unawares; and that in this piece of miſchievous policy wicked men are not behind him, they ſhew as plainly.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Whereas in the former <hi>verſe</hi> the Lion is ſaid to hunt his prey in the field, and this in <hi>to abide in his covert to lye in wait for it;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Obſerve;
<q>What ſome cannot do by ſtrength they do by craft.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>We ſay, <hi>of craft or power, 'tis hard to ſay which is moſt dangerous
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:48669:156"/> or undeſirable in an enemy.</hi> Where theſe two meet, where craft &amp; po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, ability and ſubtilty are joyned, what will they not do? We may ſay of men, in whom theſe are united, as the Lord ſaid concerning the men of the new world, ſoon after the Flood, who were uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in heart and tongue <hi>(the people are one, and they have all one language) nothing will be reſtrained from them, which they have ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined to do (Gen.</hi> 11.6.) The devil is alwayes like a Lion, both ſtrong and ſubtle: He is ſo ſtrong, that he ſometimes hunts his prey (as I may ſay) in open field, and overcomes by fine force. He is ſo crafty, that at other times he knows 'tis beſt for him to abide in his covert, and lie in wait to catch ſouls. <hi>He goeth about like a roaring Lion</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 Epiſt. 5.8.) but he is craftier than to roar always like a Lion, when <hi>he goeth about ſeeking whom he may devour;</hi> he often fawns and flatters; he uſeth his wits, and puts tricks upon poor ſouls whom he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. <hi>We</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.) <hi>are not ignorant of his devices.</hi> Chriſt adviſeth all his Diſciples to joyn the wiſdom of the Serpent, with the innocency of the Dove; ſubtilty and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, craft and innocency, working together, work well, or make good work: But where there is the ſtrength and craft of a Lion, without a dove-like integrity, what ſad work do men make? God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men, or men truly fearing God, ſometimes have the wiſdom of the ſerpent, together with their dove-like innocency; and when to both the former, the Lions ſtrength is joyned, what good may they not do? they may do (as we ſay) a world of good in an evil world.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, In that <hi>the Lion coucheth in his den,</hi> and retireth ſometimes to his covert; we may take notice of the good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God towards man. God hath ordered it, that the Lion coucheth all day in his den, and is quiet, that men may go out quietly to their labour. The Pſalmiſt commends the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God in this (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.20, 21, 22.) <hi>Thou makeſt darkneſs, and it is night, wherein all the beaſts of the Forreſt do creep forth: the young Lions roar after their prey, and ſeek their meat from God.</hi> Thus they are roaring and raging for their prey all night; but how is it with them, or what do they in the day? The next words tell us, <hi>The Sun riſeth, they gather themſelves together, and lay them down in their dens.</hi> (Then it follows) <hi>Man goeth forth to his work, and to his labour until the evening.</hi> Such
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:48669:157"/> is the care of God, that he clears fields and Countries of theſe ravenous beaſts, that man may go ſafely to his work, and not be troubled. When the Lion comes forth in the day, 'tis uſually to execute ſome judgement of God; witneſs that of the Prophet, who going out of Gods way, God told him by another Prophet, a Lion ſhall meet thee and tear thee; and ſo it came to paſs, a Lion met him, and executed the judgement of God upon him, becauſe he went beyond the command he had received from God (1 <hi>King.</hi> 13.24.) We read alſo, that God ſent Lions to vex the people continually, when they fell to idolatry and falſe worſhip (2 <hi>King.</hi> 17.26.) It was of the Lord that Lions which uſed to keep their covert in the day time, were ſo bold as to come by day to their houſes and deſtroy them. And ſuch is the mighty power of God, that though hungry Lions are altogether for prey, yet God can ſtop their mouths, and check their appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite (<hi>Dan.</hi> 6.8.) When <hi>Daniel</hi> was caſt into the Lions den, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt a company of hungry Lions, yet not one touched him, but were as meek to him as ſo many lambs; whereas no ſooner were his enemies and accuſers let down into that den, but they brake their bones before they came to the ground. Thus much of the Lion, a King among the beaſts of the earth. The Lords next queſtion concerns the Raven, none of the beſt, if not one of the worſt among the birds of the Air.</p>
                  <q>
                     <bibl>
                        <hi>Verſ. 41.</hi>
                     </bibl> Who provideth for the Raven his food? When his young ones cry unto God, they wander for lack of meat.</q>
                  <p>As the Lion is a devourer among beaſts, ſo is the Raven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong birds. The Lion (as was ſaid) is ſo curious, that he will not feed upon a carcaſe in the way, but the Raven feeds upon any dead or corrupted body; and that is the reaſon why in many great Cities there's a Law or cuſtom that Raven sneer them, ſhall not be ſhot at nor terrified, becauſe they eat up the filth and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion, which might infect the air, and breed peſtilential diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>Now the Lord puts the queſtion, <hi>Who provideth for the Raven?</hi> As if he had ſaid, I provide not only for the <hi>Kingly Lion,</hi> but for the <hi>carrion-eating Raven.</hi> The Lord made proviſion of food for Lions and Ravens, for all ſorts of beaſts, and birds, and creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things, in the work of Creation; and in his works of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, he makes all things ready, and brings them to hand for
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:48669:157"/> their uſe and ſuſtentation: He, as it were, dreſſeth and diſheth out meat for all his creatures, and then ſets it before them, that they may eat and be ſatisfied.</p>
                  <q>Who provideth for the Raven?</q>

And what's the reaſon that the ways of God are ſo pleaſant to a godly man? is it not becauſe his heart is made (through grace) ſutable to them? To do the will of God is meat and drink to a godly man; but his ſoul being in a right frame) can no more delightfully do, any thing that is ſinfully evil, than he can delight to feed bodily upon putrifaction or poyſon.</p>

Behold then, and wonder at the providence and kindneſs of God, that he ſhould provide food for the Raven, a creature of ſo diſmal a hue, and of ſo untuneable a tone, a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that is ſo odious to moſt men,<note place="margin">Avis inauſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cata.</note> and ominous to ſome. There is a great providence of God ſeen, in providing for the Ant or
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:48669:158"/> Piſmire, who gathers her meat in Summer (<hi>Prov.</hi> 6.8.) but a greater in the Raven, who though he forgets, or is careleſs to provide for himſelf, yet God provides and layeth up for him. One would think the Lord ſhould ſay of Ravens, let them ſhift for themſelves or periſh; no, the Lord God doth not deſpiſe any work of his hands; the Raven hath his being from God, and therefore the Raven ſhall be provided for by him; not only the fair innocent Dove, but the ugly Raven hath his meat from God. As the Lord feeds not only Doves, but Ravens, in kind, ſo he feeds not only Doves, but Ravens, in a figure; that is, he feeds not only dove-like or innocent men, but raven-like or wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men. (<hi>Mat.</hi> 5.45.) <hi>He cauſeth his Sun to riſe on the evil and on the good, &amp; ſendeth rain on the juſt and on the unjuſt:</hi> Thus he feeds Ravens in the likeneſs of men. Such men whoſe minds feed upon carrion, the Lord feeds their bodies with excellent dainties, they fare deliciouſly every day, as the rich Glutton is ſaid to do, who was but a Raven. The Lord, I ſay, doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provide for his better and more excellent ones, but he provides for the bad, for the evil, for the wicked; ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent father and provider is God towards all his creatures.

                     </note> notes a very ſtrong cry for help for food. The young ones of the Raven being pincht with hunger, make a loud confuſed cry for food; but to whom do they cry? the Text ſaith, <hi>They cry</hi>
                     <q>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>No creature can properly be ſaid to cry unto God, but the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional creature; and there's none among the rational creatures that indeed cry unto God, but thoſe that have faith: How then is it ſaid, The Ravens young ones <hi>cry unto God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, Firſt, They are ſaid to cry to God, becauſe man hears them not, or if he do, he regards them not; what man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards the cry of a young Raven? therefore they cry to God if to any, who alone takes notice of their cry.</p>

                     </gap>condly, They cry to God, not properly, but equivalently; they cannot be imagined to make any formal or direct prayers to God in their neceſſities, but their neceſſities which force them to cry, have the force of a cry, or of a prayer unto God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, They may be ſaid to cry unto God, becauſe God takes or interprets their cry when hungry, as a prayer to himſelf: And God may be ſaid to hear their cry, becauſe he provides for them, and helps them, as he doth thoſe who put up powerful prayers to him. There is in all creatures a deſire of that which is needful for them, or proper to them, and when that is wanting they cry, that is, make ſome ſignification of their want. And as all young ones are apt to cry (that being all they can do) for food; ſo the Scripture, as here, ſo elſewhere repreſents young Ravens crying more than other creatures (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.9.) <hi>He giveth to the beaſt his food, and to the young Ravens which cry.</hi> The beaſts are not ſaid to cry for food when God gives it them, but the young Ravens are. Crying ſeems to be the property of young Ravens, as if the leaſt lack of food made them cry.</p>
                  <p>But how come young Ravens to be in ſuch want of food, that they ſhould cry for it? and when they cry, why are they not ſaid to cry to their parents (if I may ſo ſpeak) or to the old ones, but to God for meat? In anſwer to theſe queries;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Some Naturaliſts ſay, the Raven is a forgetful creature,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:48669:160"/> and leaves her young ones altogether unprovided of food, and therefore (as the laſt reſort of all helpleſs ones) they are ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to cry unto God.</p>

The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>He that provides not for thoſe of his own houſe, hath denyed the faith, and is worſe than an infidel.</hi> A beaſt will provide for his own, and moſt birds provide for their young, but the Raven provides not for his own young ones; and therefore his young ones are brought in, as crying or complaining to the Lord of their pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But I ſhall not ſtay upon theſe things, eſpecially conſidering that they who profeſſedly write of the nature and manners, both of beaſts &amp; birds, are very ſilent, as to any ſuch obſervations concerning the Raven; yet becauſe ſo grave an Author as is noted in the Margin inſiſts upon this latter reaſon, take this Note from it.</p>
                  <q>
                     <pb n="301" facs="tcp:48669:160"/>Every one loves its like.</q>
                  <p>A Raven doth not love her young, till ſhe perceives them in her own likeneſs. It is ſaid alſo of the Eagle, that when her young are firſt hatcht, ſhe will not own them for hers, till having held them up to the Sun, ſhe finds they out-face it; &amp; here 'tis ſaid, the Raven will not own her young till they are black. Now, if it be thus in nature, if it be a truth, that the Raven is not delighted in her young till they grow black, 'tis doubtleſs true in ſpirituals, <hi>like to like.</hi> God loves none with delight, but holy and pure ones, and the more holy and pure any are, the more he loves them; the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, becauſe himſelf is altogether infinitely pure and holy. Where God ſees moſt of his own image, which is pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ity and holineſs, there he loves moſt, and for ſuch he will certainly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide, ſuch he will ſurely feed.</p>
                  <p>But, which way ſoever the young ones of the Raven come to want food, whether it be through the forgetfulneſs, or the unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalneſs of the old Raven, or becauſe they are hatchr white, upon what account ſoever (I ſay) it is, that they come to want food, the Text ſaith they are in ſuch want, that they <hi>cry to God,</hi> yea, that
<q>They wander for lack of meat.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is a further evidence of their diſtreſs, they cry when they are in their neſt, and there God provides for them; and when <hi>they wander</hi> (from their neſt) <hi>for lack of meat,</hi> God feeds them too. Some reſtrain this wandring to a narrow compaſs, and ſay, 'tis only in their neſt, where they ſtruggle and are unquiet for want of meat; but this their wandering for want of meat, may be conceived to be out of the neſt, rather than in it; for a neſt being a ſtrait place, it cannot be congruouſly ſaid, that the young ones wander while they are in it. And therefore, which clears the matter ſufficiently, Naturaliſts tell us, That when the Raven hath fed his young in the neſt, till they are well fledged and able to flie abroad, then he thruſts them out of the neſt, and will not let them abide there, but puts them to get their own living. Now when theſe young ones are upon their firſt flight from their neſt, and are little acquainted with means how to help themſelves with food, then the Lord provides food for them.

                     </note> for as ſoon as his young ones are able to provide for themſelves, he will not fetch any more food for them; yea, ſome affirm, the old ones will not ſuffer them to ſtay in the ſame Country where they were bred; and if ſo, then they muſt needs wander. We ſay proverbially, <hi>Need makes the old wife trot;</hi> we may ſay, and <hi>The young ones too.</hi> It hath been, and poſſibly is, the practiſe of ſome parents towards their children, who as ſoon as they can ſhift for themſelves, and are fit in any competency to get their bread, they turn them out of doors, as the Raven doth his young ones out of the neſt. Now ſaith the Lord in the Text, When the young ones of the Raven are at this pinch, that they are turned off, and wander for lack of meat, who then provides for them? do not I the Lord? do not I who provide for the old Raven, provide for his young ones, both while they abide in the neſt, and when they wander for lack of meat?</p>
                  <p>Hence note firſt, (which was in part toucht before.)</p>
                  <q>The providence of God extends it ſelf to all, even the meaneſt of his creatures.</q>
                  <p>As ſome deny providence, ſo others reſtrain it to greater mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, or more eminent creatures, as if it were true of <hi>Jehovah,</hi> which Heathens ſaid of their Idol <hi>Jupiter; He is not at leiſure to mind little things.</hi> But the Lord <hi>Jehovah</hi> diſdains not to look after the leaſt things, he <hi>looks into birds neſts,</hi> to ſee they want no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, or to ſupply their wants. Young Ravens are inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble creatures, yet the Lord remembers and conſiders them. And if God take care of young Ravens, then I may again infer, he will much more take care of their young ones or children, who are themſelves heirs of the promiſe, the ſpiritual ſeed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, in that young Ravens are here ſaid to cry unto God,</p>
                  <p>Obſerve;
<q>Extream want or neceſſity will put meer nature upon praying or crying to God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The worſt of men, yea, the very beaſts will pray in their kind, or after their manner, when they are pinched with extremities, either of want or fear. The Heathen Marriners in <hi>Jonah,</hi>
                     <pb n="403" facs="tcp:48669:161"/> being greatly diſtreſſed, <hi>cryed every one to his god.</hi> There may be a cry of prayer to God in the mouth; where there is no grace in the heart. The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. <hi>Whoſoever calleth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the name of the Lord ſhall be ſaved;</hi> but then it muſt be in faith, for ſo it follows there, <hi>How ſhall they call on him on whom they have not believed?</hi> Many call upon God, that ſhall not be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.41.) <hi>They cryed, but their was none to ſave them, even to the Lord, but he anſwered them not.</hi> The cry of graceleſs men is ſeldomer heard than the cry of reaſonleſs beaſts or birds. Hence,</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Note;
<q>The Lord hears the cry of nature when 'tis in want.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He hears the cry of beaſts, and he hears the cry of Ravens. Though wicked men ſtop their ears, and will not hear his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, yet he ſometimes hears their cryes in outward troubles, and doth them good many wayes.</p>
                  <p>Hence alſo we may infer;
<q>If the Lord hears the cry of nature in beaſts, and birds, and bad men, how much more will he hear the cry of grace, and of the ſpirit of Adoption, crying Abba father, in his children?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>If he hears the croking cry of young Ravens, who have no intention to pray to him, how much more will he hear the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving cry, the deep groans and ſighs of Saints, who <hi>ſet their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> purpoſely to pray unto him, and ſeek his face. <hi>This poor man cryed</hi> (a man rich in grace doubtleſs he was) <hi>and the Lord heard him, and ſaved him out of all his troubles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Note;
<q>If you would have ſupply in your wants, you muſt ask it of God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>When you are in want, whither ſoever you go, if you go not to God, you go to a wrong door: The Ravens tell you whither to go when you are in want; it is not to this or that creature, to this or that means, to this friend or that, but you muſt go to God for help; and if we have help any where elſe, and not in God, our help is worſe than our diſtreſs. Wants are an evil of
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:48669:162"/> affliction, but the help we get out of wants in any way, with neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of God, is an evil of ſin, therefore cry to God. The Lions are ſaid to ſeek their meat from God, and here the Ravens are ſaid to cry unto God; the young Lions and the Ravens, will condemn thoſe, who in their diſtreſſes do not cry to God the fountain, but run to broken ciſterns. It was the ſin of that good King <hi>Aſa,</hi> that <hi>in his diſeaſe he ſought not to God, but to the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians</hi> (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.12.) not that <hi>Aſa</hi> had caſt off prayer to God, or did not at all ſeek unto him (it cannot be that ſo good a man as the Scripture reports him, ſhould ſo much at once forget God and himſelf) but the meaning is, he was very cold and negligent in calling upon God for help, and over confident of help by his Phyſicians.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, conſider, God provides for the young Ravens, when the old ones leave them, or put them out of their neſt.</p>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>When neareſt Relations in nature leave us, God will not.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>When they whoſe duty it is to take care of us, prove unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, like the Raven to his young ones, then God will take care of us. <hi>When my father and mother forſook me</hi> (ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 27.9, 10.) <hi>then the Lord took me up.</hi> The Lord who ſeeds out-caſt Ravens, will give entertainment to his out-caſt ſervants. (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.5.) <hi>A father of the fatherleſs, and a judge of the widows, is God in his holy habitation.</hi> They that are fatherleſs by their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents deſerting of them, or fatherleſs by the deceaſe of their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, God (they committing themſelves to him) will be a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unto them, he will do the office of a father to them, that is, provide for them. Thus much of the Lion, chief among the beaſts of the earth, and of the Raven, one of the worſt among the fowls of the Air. The wiſdom of God hath choſen out theſe creatures, that in teſtifying his care of them, he might convince <hi>Job,</hi> that he had not caſt off the care of him, but would provide for him, poſſibly in unknown wayes of providence, as he did for the Lions and the Ravens.</p>

In this context and <hi>Chapter</hi> the Lord proceeds to ſhew his care and providence concerning both the production and ſuſtentation of ſeveral other creatures, of whom men take no care nor make any proviſion for at all. <hi>The wild Goats and the Hind, the wild Aſſe and the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nicorn.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are ſome creatures which live under mans inſpection, and are provided for by him, being tame and ſerviceable; there are others which have no commerce (as I may ſay) with man, but are ſavage, living at la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The wild Goats are preſerved as well as the ſheep, and the Hinds of the Forreſt as well as the Calves of the Stall. In and by all theſe examples the Lord would have <hi>Job</hi> take ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial notice, that his providence extendeth both to the feeding or nouriſhing of all kinds of creatures, as alſo to their births and bringing forth, for the preſervation of their ſeveral kinds.</p>
                  <pb n="306" facs="tcp:48669:163"/>
                  <p>So then, the providence of God is here magnified in continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and multiplying ſeveral ſorts of four footed beaſts of the earth and winged fowls of the air; ſome of which being tame are kept by the care of man; others being wild and avoiding the preſence of man (he ſcarce knowing the nature of them, nor having any ſervice by them) are perpetuated in their kinds by the only care of God.</p>
                  <p>In theſe four <hi>verſes</hi> there are two things in general, about which the Lord holds forth his care of theſe ſavage creatures. Firſt, About the bringing forth of their young ones. Secondly, About the bringing up of their young ones. The bringing forth of their young ones, we have in the three firſt <hi>verſes</hi> of this <hi>Chapter;</hi> the bringing up of their young ones, we have in the 4th <hi>verſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>About the bringing forth of their young ones the Text ſpeaks two things. Firſt, The ſeaſon of it; and ſecondly, The pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful manner of it.</p>
                  <p>The ſeaſon of it in the two firſt <hi>Verſes. Knoweſt thou the time when the wild Goats of the rock bring forth? (verſe</hi> 1.) and then of the hinds (<hi>ver.</hi> 2.) <hi>Canſt thou number the months that they fulfill?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The painful manner of bringing forth their young is expreſſed at the 3d verſe, <hi>They bow down themſelves, they bring forth their young ones, they caſt out their ſorrows.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The bringing up and growth of their young ones is given (<hi>ver.</hi> 4.) <hi>Their young ones are in good liking, they grow up with corn,</hi> &amp;c. Thus we have the general ſcope and parts of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text. I ſhall now deal with the particulars.</p>

The word which we render <hi>wild Goats,</hi> ſignifies in the Hebrew <hi>aſcending or clambering,</hi> becauſe Goats are clambering creatures, getting up the ſteepeſt rocks, and aſcending the height of hills and mountains, which they do many times exceeding dangerouſly, ſeeming rather to hang by their feet than to go upon them.<note place="margin">

The Latines have a word ſignifying <hi>wild Goats,</hi> which criticks ſay, comes from another la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine word ſignifying <hi>a bird</hi> or flying fowl, becauſe Goats may be ſaid rather to fly than go upon thoſe craggy places, or rather to uſe wings than feet.

                  <p>Becauſe they ſpecially delight in rocky places, or becauſe they breed and bring forth in rocks.

Saul</hi> did not ſeek <hi>David</hi> only in the plains and valleys, where flocks of ſheep feed; but upon the craggy rocks and precipices, where wild Goats take up their quarters or uſe to feed. This ſhewed his implacable rage, and revengeful ſpirit againſt an innocent perſon, that rather than not take him and have his will on him, he would undertake an expedition, not only tedious but very hazardous to himſelf and his army. <hi>Wrathful men will not only not ſpare others, but not themſelves.</hi> But to the Text, <hi>Knoweſt thou the time when the wild Goats of the rock</hi>

                     </note>The word tranſlated <hi>bring forth</hi> ſignifies pain and ſorrow.

                  </p>
                  <p>But why did the Lord enquire of <hi>Job</hi> here, whether he knew the time, the exact time of their bringing forth? is that a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret? I anſwer, doubtleſs it is a ſecret, and ſuch a ſecret as few are acquainted with.

                     </gap>aggy rocks and mountains, men cannot without much difficulty reach that piece of knowledge. And therefore the Lord might well ask of <hi>Job, Knoweſt thou the time when the wild Goats of the rock bring forth?</hi> I may ſay alſo, the Lord puts this familiar queſtion to <hi>Job,</hi> that he might the more awaken him into the conſideration of his own weakneſs, and utter inability to find out the ſecret of his other works. As if the Lord had ſaid, <hi>thou canſt not diſcover ſo much as the birth of the wild Goats, how then canſt thou find out the births of my wonderful provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences? My providences bring forth wonderful births, and much more unknowable by thee than the birth and bringing forth of the wild Goats.</hi> Thus the Lord would check his curioſity; he who was unable to give him an account concerning the ſtate of thoſe poor creatures, muſt not think himſelf able to pry into the great and unſearchable works of God, in the amazing products of his providence towards the children of men.</p>
                  <p>Before I paſs from theſe words it will not be unprofitable to mind the Reader, how (as one of the Antients hath hinted) we may moralize or ſpiritualize this Text,<note place="margin">Gregor <hi>l.</hi> 30. <hi>mor. c.</hi> 16.</note> there being much of the diſpoſition or condition of a godly man, eſpecially of a faithful Teacher, typed or fairly repreſented in the nature and qualities of theſe wild Goats.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, As theſe wild Goats ſeek both their food and reſt, their repaſt and refuge in rocks; So the godly abide and dwell in the rock, that is, in the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> they look to him alone both for refuge and refreſhing, both for comfort and ſafety while they are in this world. Chriſt is the rock upon which the Church is
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:48669:164"/> built (<hi>Mat.</hi> 16.18.) And as the ſtate of the true Church in general, ſo of every true believer, is built upon this immovable rock the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As the rocks, ſo the mountains are much deſired by the wild Goats (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.18.) <hi>The high hills are a refuge for the wild Goats.</hi> Thus <hi>David</hi> was eying the hills for help (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 121.1.) <hi>I will lift up mine eyes to the hills, from whence cometh my help.</hi> What were theſe hills? Surely, neither the material nor metaphorical hills of this world, of which latter the people of God ſpake (<hi>Jerem.</hi> 3.23.) diſclamingly, <hi>Truly in vain is ſalvation hoped for from the hills, and from the multitude of mountains,</hi> that is, from the greateſt power of man or men. What the hills were to which <hi>David</hi> lifted up his eyes for help, himſelf tells us at the ſecond <hi>verſe</hi> of that <hi>Pſalm, My help cometh from the Lord, which made heaven and earth.</hi> As the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of a godly man are ſet upon the things above, not upon things below (<hi>Col.</hi> 3.2.) ſo his confidences are ſet upon God who is above, not upon men here below.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Theſe wild Goats are very agil &amp; active creatures, much in motion, full of life, full of ſpirits; and ſo they reſemble a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man, he is a man of motion, of ſpiritual motion; and he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires his motions and ſpeed may be more and more ſpeedy in the ways of God. As <hi>David</hi> reſolved <hi>to run the ways of Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,</hi> when God ſhould pleaſe to enlarge his heart; ſo doubtleſs he prayed, that God would enlarge his heart to run thoſe ways. And how often did he pray for quickning grace and livelineſs, that being delivered from a ſlow, dull, flegmatique ſpirit, he might be active and full of holy fire about the things, and for the things of God.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Wild Goats of the rocks, in thoſe countries where they abound, are much purſued and di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>quieted by huntſ-men, as that paſſage which I before quoted from a Heathen Poet intimates; ſo good men, the beſt of men are often hunted and diſturbed in this world, there are hunters of men, as well as hunters of beaſts. <hi>Nimrod</hi> was a mighty hunter (<hi>Gen.</hi> 10.9.) he was a hunter of men. <hi>Saul</hi> hunted <hi>David</hi> even as a wild Goat on the rocks, or as a Partridg on the mountains.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, They who hunt the wild Goats are at a very dangerous pleaſure, they often fall upon the rocks, and ſometimes fall from
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:48669:165"/> the rocks. Is it not ſo with thoſe who without cauſe purſue good men? have they not a dangerous ſervice of it? get they not many a fall? <hi>The wicked</hi> (ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 37.12, 13.) <hi>plotteth,</hi> or (as the Margin hath it) <hi>practiſeth againſt the righteous, he gnaſheth upon him with his teeth.</hi> But ſhall it go well with him who doth this evil? The next words anſwer, <hi>The Lord ſhall laugh at him, for he ſeeth that his day is coming.</hi> What day? ſurely a black day, even the day of his deſtruction; which is yet further confirmed in the 14. and 15. <hi>verſes</hi> of the ſame P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>alm. <hi>The wicked have drawn out the ſword, and have bent their bow to caſt down the poor and needy, and to ſlay ſuch as be of upright converſation, or the upright of way.</hi> But ſhall this end well with them? or ſhall it be well with them in the end? The next words tell us what their end ſhall be, even this, which is a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful end, <hi>Their ſword ſhall enter into their own heart, and their bows ſhall be broken.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, 'Tis obſerved of theſe wild Goats, that when they ſeem to be very near falling from the rock and high places, yet they fall not, and that though they fall they take little or no hurt at all. Some ſay they have a naturall art to ſave themſelves, they know how to fall upon their feet, and ſo eſcape without harm. This alſo is applicable to the caſe of godly men, they are often near falling, yet they do not fall, and when they fall, they take no hurt; they have a divine art to preſerve themſelves; and 'tis a truth, that though they do receive hurt in the fleſh, yet their ſpirit or better part takes no hurt. <hi>Though a good man fall</hi> (into affliction or temptation) <hi>he ſhall not</hi> (ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 37.24.) <hi>be utterly caſt down, for the Lord upholdeth him with his hand.</hi> Yea, though <hi>he falleth</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 24.16.) <hi>ſeven times</hi> (that is, often, into affliction, 'tis true alſo of his falling into ſin) <hi>yet he riſeth again,</hi> out of affliction by deliverance, out of ſin by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. With reſpect to the former, the Church warned her inſulting enemy (<hi>Mich.</hi> 7.8.) <hi>Rejoyce not againſt me O mine enemy; when I fall, I ſhall ariſe. Babylon</hi> ſhall fall and riſe no more; but though <hi>Sion</hi> may fall, yet ſhe ſhall aſſuredly riſe again.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, It is ſaid of the wild Goats, that when they receive hurt, they, by a natural inſtinct, ſeek out the herb <hi>Betany,</hi> grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing among the rocks and upon mountains, which gives a preſent and perfect cure to their bruiſes or hurts. Thus when good
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:48669:165"/> men receive hurt in and from the evil world, they have ſome herb or other, ſome comfort or other for their cure; they go to the Word of God, to the Scriptures, there they find Medicine for all their ſickneſſes, Betany for all thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> bruiſes, and a Salve for every ſore. Thus we may ſpiritualize our meditations upon theſe wild creatures the Goats of the rocks, in alluſion to the ſtate of godly men in this life. <hi>Knoweſt thou the time when the wild Goats of the rock bring forth?</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>Hind</hi> in the Text is the female, and the Scripture ſpeaks of the Hind in a twofold alluſion. Firſt, In alluſion to Chriſt. Secondly, In alluſion to thoſe that are Chriſts.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. For his ſwiftneſs and ſpeedineſs in coming to the relief and help of his Church (<hi>Cant.</hi> 28.9.) <hi>Behold, he cometh leaping upon the mountains, and ſkipping upon the hills; my beloved is like a Roe, or young Hart,</hi> or Hind, 'tis the ſame word. <hi>His leaping and ſkipping</hi> notes 1. His chearfulneſs. 2. His ſpeedineſs in coming. The mountains and hills upon which he leaps and skips, note the great obſtacles and difficulties, which ſtand in his way when he comes to help his Church, his beloved Spouſe. Again (<hi>Cant.</hi> 8.13.) <hi>Be thou like the young Roe, or young Hart upon the mountains of ſpices:</hi> The Church deſcribes the gracious haſt which ſhe deſires Jeſus Chriſt would make to help, comfort, and relieve her, by the ſpeedy running of the young Hart.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Jeſus Chriſt is ſo compared with reſpect to his lovingneſs; that's the Epithete which <hi>Solomon</hi> gives the Hind (<hi>Prov.</hi> 5.19.) <hi>Let her</hi> (thy Wife) <hi>be as the loving Hind and pleaſant R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Chriſt is ſo full of love, that he is called love it ſelf. One of the Antients ſpeaking of Chriſt dying, ſaid <hi>My Love was crucified.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Jeſus Chriſt is ſhadowed by the Hind, with reſpect to his ſufferings, for he was hunted as a Hind with Hounds, with blood-hounds, with the hell-hounds of this world, the worſt of wicked men. Therefore it is remarkable, that in the 22. <hi>Pſalme,</hi> which is throughout a prophecy of Chriſt (the firſt words being the laſt
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:48669:166"/> he ſpake in this world, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi>) The title of that Pſalm is, <hi>To the chief muſician, upon Aijeleh Sahar;</hi> and if you would know what that ſignifies, look into the Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>gin of your larger Bibles, there you ſhall find, <hi>The Hind of the morning.</hi> Hunters uſe to ſingle out that ſpecial Deer, Hart or Hind, early in the morning, which they purpoſe for game that day; ſignifying that Jeſus Chriſt, who is ſo much ſpoke of in that Pſalm, was a Hind, not only ſorely and fiercely, but early hunted by wicked men to death.</p>
                  <p>Again, The Scripture ſpeaks of the Hind, with reſpect unto godly men.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, As to the freeneſs and cheerfulneſs of their ſpirits, in the wayes and things of God. The Prophet (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 35.6.) ſhews how it ſhall be with thoſe that receive the Goſpel, though they have been lame, impotent cripples before, not able to take one ſtep God-ward, yet, ſaith he, <hi>The lame ſhall leap as a Hart,</hi> or as a Hind; that is, they ſhall exceedingly rejoyce at the receiving of the Goſpel, and be very active in the obedience of it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As to that exceeding thirſt, ſtrong appetite or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, which true believers have to and after Jeſus Chriſt, who is the living water, the water of life. Thus <hi>David</hi> ſpake of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.1.) <hi>As the Hart panteth after the water-brooks, ſo panteth my ſoul after thee, O God.</hi> Some render, as the <hi>ſhe Hart,</hi> that is, the Hind, <hi>panteth after the water brooks,</hi> &amp;c. When <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> would expreſs the exceeding ardency of his ſouls thirſt after Chriſt, he compares it to the thirſt of a hunted Hart or Hind.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Hind is very ſwift of foot; ſo are believers: as they have ſtrong deſires, ſo ſpeedy purſuits after Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>David</hi> had a holy confidence, that God would make him ſwift in ſpirit, when he ſaid (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.33.) <hi>The Lord ſhall make my feet like Hinds feet;</hi> that is, he will make me very active, agile, and nimble, not only for the avoiding of corporal evils, but alſo in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of ſpiritual good things.</p>
                  <p>F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>u thly, The Hind loves high places, or to be and breath in the free air. Thus the Prophet <hi>Habakkuk</hi> ſpeaks of himſelf (<hi>Hab.</hi> 3.19.) <hi>The Lord will make my feet like Hinds feet, he will make me walk upon my high places.</hi> He means not the high places of worldly preferment or power, but of peace and ſafety; nor ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them, ſo much as thoſe truly high places of a holy life and
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:48669:167"/> joy, in ſpiritual meditation and converſation, to which we reſort by the wings of ſaith in, and love unto God. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon theſe high pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces thou wilt make me to walk.</hi> As if the Prophet had ſaid, I ſhall go lightly and ſweetly on in my journey to heaven, having my ſoul ſupplied and ſuppled (as it were) with the oyl of ſpiritual joy and gladneſs. As it is ſaid of <hi>Jacob (Gen.</hi> 29.1.) after that he had that bleſſed viſion at <hi>Bethel,</hi> in the cloſe of the 28th Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) <hi>He we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t on his journey;</hi> or (as we put in the margin) <hi>He lift up his feet;</hi> his feet were like Hinds feet, lithe and nimble for his journey, going on in faith towards God, and in the light of his countenance.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, It is obſerved by Naturaliſts, that Hinds are very cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable and helpful one to another; and they give that ſpecial in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, when ſwimming over any River or deep water, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is ſupported by the firſt, and the third by the ſecond, and ſo to the laſt they help one another over; which doth excellently ſhadow the uſefulneſs that ſhould be among Chriſtians, and their helpfulneſs mutual; they ſhould be as Harts and Hinds always in this reſpect, and then moſt when they come into the Rivers and deep waters of ſorrow and trouble, then they ſhould ſupport and bear up each one his brother. The Apoſtles word is (<hi>Gal.</hi> 6.2.) <hi>Bear one anothers burdens, and ſo fulfil the Law of Chriſt.</hi> The burdens which he there intends, are not only the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities which are in us, but the afflictions and troubles which poſſibly we may at any time be in. And again (<hi>Phil.</hi> 2.4.) <hi>Let not every man mind his own things, but let him mind the things which are anothers;</hi> that is, let him be helpful to others in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things, much more let him be helpful to others in ſpiritual things. Thus the Scripture ſpeaks, both of Jeſus Chriſt, and of thoſe that are his, under the ſimilitude of the Hind.</p>
                  <p>From both parts of the verſe, in that the Lord puts the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion here to <hi>Job, Knoweſt thou the time when the wilde Goats of the rocks bring forth? or canſt thou mark the time when the Hinds do calve?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note, Firſt;
<q>The Lord himſelf takes ſpecial care of the wildeſt creatures, even of thoſe which are moſt remote from the help and care of man.</q>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="315" facs="tcp:48669:167"/>
                  <p>The care and tenderneſs of God toward beaſts, turns to his praiſe, as well as the care which he hath of, and the tenderneſs which he ſhews to believers. And as it doth exceedingly advance the glory of God, that he takes care of wilde beaſts, ſo it may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly ſtrengthen the faith of man, that he will take care of him. Doth the Lord take care of wilde Goats and of Hinds, then certainly he takes care of thoſe that particularly belong to him; as hath been already ſhewed or inferred from ſuch like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances as we have here in the Text.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, From the particular Point, upon which the care of God is here intimated, with reſpect to the wilde Goats and Hinds; namely, their bringing forth and calving, we learn, that
<q>There is a ſpecial providence of God towards theſe and ſuch like creatures, for the production of their young.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He</hi> (if I may ſo ſpeak with reverence) <hi>ſhews his Midwifry, in helping theſe ſavage beaſts when their pains come upon them.</hi> As the Lord takes man (in an eminent manner) <hi>out of the womb (Pſal.</hi> 22.9.) ſo in a manner, he takes beaſts out of the womb too (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 29.8, 9.) <hi>The voice of the Lord ſhaketh the wilderneſs, it ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the wilderneſs of Kadeſh.</hi> So we tranſlate it; but the word which we render <hi>ſhaketh,</hi> is the ſame with this in the Text, which ſignifieth <hi>to bring forth:</hi> And hence ſome very learned in the Hebrew tongue, do not render as we, <hi>The voice of the Lord ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the wilderneſs,</hi> but, <hi>The voice of the Lord maketh the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to bring forth; The Lord maketh the wilderneſs of</hi> Kadeſh <hi>to bring forth;</hi> which is not to be underſtood of the vegetative creatures (that's a truth, the Lord makes the Trees of the Forreſt to bring forth both leaves and fruit) but it is meant of animals or living creatures there: And then, when he ſaith, <hi>The voice of the Lord maketh the wilderneſs to bring forth,</hi> the meaning is, <hi>The Lord makes the wilde beaſt of the wilderneſs to bring forth;</hi> which ſeems to be the clear ſenſe of the place, by that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth; for the Pſalmiſt having ſaid this in general at the 8 h verſe, <hi>The voice of the Lord maketh the wilderneſs to bring forth,</hi> he in the 9th verſe, gives the ſpecial inſtance of the Hind, <hi>The voice of the Lord maketh the Hinds to calve.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So much concerning the wilde Goats bringing forth their young, and the Hinds calving. In the next verſe the Lord enquires of
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:48669:168"/> 
                     <hi>Job,</hi> the time how long they go with young before they bring forth and calve.</p>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h. Thus the Lord would ſhew his people, that however be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo luſty, ſo wanton, there was no dealing with them, yet a month of ſorrow was coming upon them, even as upon one with young, wherein they ſhould feel, and be under ſuch ſad pains, as would burden them to purpoſe (as we ſay) and then they would be found, and might be ſpoken with. Wilde Aſſes have their months, their months of bearing, and their month of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth; about thoſe and this the Lord enquires of <hi>Job, Canſt thou number the months that they fulfil?</hi> The queſtion is not ſo to be underſtood, as if the number of the months which they fulfil were ſo many that they could not be numbred; but the Lord ſpeaks thus, becauſe of the uncertainty of the time (as to man) when thoſe months are fulfilled. <hi>David</hi> prayed (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.4.) <hi>Lord, ſhew me the number of my dayes;</hi> not as if the number of his dayes were ſo many, that he could hardly find out the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them Arithmetically, but being ſo uncertain, he needed the Lords inſtruction to teach him how to count the number of them ſpiritually. So here, <hi>Canſt thou number the months that they
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:48669:168"/> fulfil;</hi> that's as great a ſecret as the number of any mans dayes in this world are.</p>
                  <p>Yet it may be objected; ſurely it is no ſuch hard matter to number the months which Hinds and wilde Goats fulfil: For if the queſtion be, what time of their age Goats firſt conceive,<note place="margin">Aliquando anniculae ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per binae &amp; pariunt octonis annis. <hi>Plin. l. 8. c. 50.</hi>
                     </note> and how long they continue bearing, <hi>Pliny</hi> anſwers? Sometimes they conceive at a year old, alwayes at two years old; and (ſaith he) they continue bearing eight years. Secondly, If the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion be, about what time of the year they conceive and bring forth? the ſame Author anſwers, They conceive in <hi>November,</hi> and b ing fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>th in <hi>March,</hi> ſo that they go burdened five months. Again, if the queſtion be about the Hinds, he thus reſolves it; They conceive about the latter end of <hi>September,</hi> and bring forth about the middle of <hi>April,</hi> the whole time they go,<note place="margin">Octonis monſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus ſerunt p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout eight months; ſo that there ſeems no ſuch difficulty in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring the months, which either wilde Goats or Hinds fulfil, that is, how long they go with young.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer; Though the general time which they fulfil may be known, or is known and ſet down by Writers, yet the precile particular time, the day of the month, or hour of the day, or (which is the thing enquired) when their months come out and are fulfilled, that's a ſecret. Though it be commonly known, that a woman goes nine months with child, yet who knows, or can a woman her ſelf know exactly to a day, or an hour, when her pains and travel will come upon her? Many women have been under great miſtakes in that ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e, and rarely do any hit the time right, but reckon a day two or three over or under the juſt account. So then, though the general time is known, yet the exact particular time is not known. I may ſay in this caſe, as our Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſaid about the end of the world, <hi>Of that day and hour knows no man;</hi> we may know the general time, we may know it will not be long before the world ſhall end. The time which the world ſhall go with its great birth, is commonly ſaid to be ſix thouſand years; but the day and hour of its travel, and of the conſummation of all things according to the decree of God, no man, no nor Angel, knows. Here the Lord queſtions <hi>Job</hi> about the exact particular time, which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf keeps, as he doth all ſpecial ſeaſons, in his own h nd <hi>or power,</hi> under his own lock and key, as Chriſt told his Diſciples, (<hi>Act.</hi> 1.7.) <hi>Canſt thou number the months that they fulfil?</hi> doſt thou keep their reckoning?</p>
                  <q>
                     <pb n="318" facs="tcp:48669:169"/>Or knoweſt thou the time when they bring forth?</q>
                  <p>'Tis the ſame in effect that was ſpoken before, therefore I ſhall not ſtay upon it.</p>
                  <p>From the whole verſe obſerve:
<q>The Lord only can give timely ſuccour to all creatures.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The reaſon is implyed in the Text, <hi>Becauſe he only knows the certain time of their extremity.</hi> None can give exact and timely help to the neceſſity of another, but he that knows the exact time of his extremity. The Lord can and will give deliverance to his people, in the very nick of time, when the months of their ſorrow and burdens are fulfilled, for he knows the number of them. The children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had long and ſore bondage in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> but no longer than the months which were appointed; for as ſoon as they were fulfilled, their bondage was ended, and they delivered; mark how the Spirit of God records it to a day (<hi>Exod.</hi> 12.41.) <hi>And it came to paſs at the end of the four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And this is that night of the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> The reaſon I conceive was this; The word <hi>day</hi> may be taken largely, for a natural day conſiſting of twenty four hours; now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the four hundred and thirty years were fulfilled and ended at the beginning of that day, (the Jewiſh account of dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning at evening) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>herefore their deliverance began then, and did not ſtay till the morning. Thus exact is the Lord, keeping his word not only to a day, but to a piece, yea, to the very hour of a day. And as the Lord gave that people deliverance juſt when thoſe years were fulfilled, according to that ancient prophecy; ſo doubtleſs when the forty two months, or (which is the ſame) the thouſand two hundred and threeſcore dayes for his witneſſes prophecying in ſack-cloth (<hi>Rev.</hi> 11.2, 3.) ſhall be fulfilled, then they alſo
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:48669:169"/> ſhall come out of their bondage from under myſtical <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Babylon.</hi> Men have been long gueſſing at the fulfilling of thoſe forty two months, but may we not ſay to them concerning the birth of that prophecy, in the ſame ſenſe that the Lord doth here to <hi>Job,</hi> concerning the particular time when the wilde Goats of the rock, and the Hinds bring forth, <hi>Canſt thou number the months that they fulfil?</hi> As the particular time of the Hinds ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling her months, ſo of <hi>Sions</hi> fulfilling her months of ſorrow in this world, is a ſecret which the Lord hath reſerved to himſelf, and keeps faſt lockt up in the Cabinet of his eternal counſels. <hi>Knoweſt thou the time when they bring forth?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Lord having thus queſtioned <hi>Job</hi> about the time of the bringing forth of theſe two creatures, in theſe two verſes, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to queſtion him about the manner of their bringing forth, or the painfulneſs of it.</p>
                  <q>

                     <hi>They bow themſelves,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
                  <p>Theſe words are a deſcription of the hard travel of the Hinds, not of the Goats, as Interpreters generally agree. Bowing of the body is the poſture of any creature in travel to bring forth. As if the Lord had ſaid, <hi>Is it thou, O</hi> Job, <hi>that haſt, or I, that have given them an inſtinct in nature to put their bodies (as wilde as they are) conſiderately, into ſuch a poſture (when their pains come upon them) as may be moſt eaſeful for themſelves, and leaſt hurtful to their off-ſpring, by bowing their bodies to dilate the paſſages of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſo by a natural Midwifry to deliver themſelves of their burdens?</hi> as followeth,
<q>They bring forth their young ones.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The word rendred <hi>bring forth,</hi> ſignifies <hi>to cleave aſunder,</hi>

So the word is tranſlated (Chap. 16.13.) where <hi>Job</hi> making a lamentable complaint about his ſufferings under the hand of God, expreſſeth it thus; <hi>His archers compaſs me round about, he clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth my reins aſunder.</hi> Such torture have theſe poor creatures in bringing forth their young; which is more plainly ſet down in the cloſe of the verſe,
<q>

                  </p>
                  <p>Which may be underſtood two ways; Firſt, bowing to free themſelves of their young ones, their ſorrows end, or there is an end of their ſorrows, they are caſt out. Secondly, Thus they caſt out their ſorrows; that is, their young ones are caſt out which have put them to much ſorrow &amp; grievous throws, &amp; ſo may well be called their ſorrows; as <hi>Rachel</hi> called that child with which ſhe had ſuch hard travel, <hi>Ben-oni, The ſon of her ſorrows (Gen.</hi> 35.18.)</p>
                  <p>The word which we render <hi>ſorrows,</hi> ſignifies <hi>cords and bonds,</hi> implying, that theſe creatures are girded and bound about with extream pain, until (by the power of God in nature) they receive deliverance. Some are bound and girded with troubles, in and from the world, who yet are not ſorrowful; we through faith may even <hi>glory in tribulation (Rom.</hi> 5.3.) but they who are ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful, are alwayes bound; and therefore the ſame word ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth bonds and ſorrows. <hi>They caſt out their ſorrows.</hi>

                  <p>This is part of that vanity brought by mans ſin upon the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, of which the Apoſtle ſpeaks (<hi>Rom.</hi> 8.22.) <hi>We know that the whole creation</hi> (or <hi>every creature) groaneth and travelleth in pain together until now.</hi>

As ſoon as man ſinned, the Lord laid that affliction on the woman, <hi>In ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ſhalt thou bring forth (Gen.</hi> 3.16.) Now that which was firſt
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:48669:170"/> declared an affliction, with reſpect to the woman, is fallen upon all creatures in their degree; they all are more or leſs pained in tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, or travel in pain. The ſin of man hath brought ſorrow upon the whole world, even upon ſinleſs creatures; &amp; therefore man ſhould pity poor creatures in their ſorrows, his ſin having brought thoſe ſorrows upon them. How vile then are they, who meerly to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie their luſts, encreaſe the ſorrows of the creature, and cauſe them to travel more than needs, in pain every day?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Lord inſtanceth here in the Hinds for hard travel; and Naturaliſts obſerve, the Hind hath the ſoreſt travel in bringing forth of any creature, woman excepted. And, that the Hinds have very ſore travel in bringing forth, beſide what Naturaliſts ſpeak, may be collected from thoſe expreſſions in the Text, <hi>They bow themſelves, they bring forth their young ones, they caſt out their ſorrows.</hi> That Scripture alſo intimates as much (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 29.9.) when among other wonderful effects of thunder, <hi>The breaking of Cedars,</hi> &amp;c. This is added, <hi>The voice of the Lord maketh the Hinds to calve;</hi> as if it did require the ſpecial help of God, to give the Hinds eaſe and deliverance in the time of their travel, <hi>The voice</hi> of God doth it; that is,<note place="margin">

                  <p>And here we may conſider the goodneſs of God, even to this wilde beaſt, in ordering her natural helps, to eaſe her the more ſpeedily of her grievous pains in bringing forth her young ones.</p>
                  <p>The natural Hiſtorian tells us concerning the Hind, that ſhe by common inſtinct, a litle before ſhe calves, feeling her pains coming upon her, ſeeks out a certain herb called <hi>Seſelis,</hi> feeding upon which doth exceedingly facilitate her pains in bringing forth. Women, who have underſtanding and reaſon, as alſo the aſſiſtance of friends about them, have many means for their eaſe in that hour of extremity; but the Lord hath made this poor creature, both Phyſician and Midwife to her ſelf. Further, 'tis reported of them, that when they have brought forth, they uſe the ſame and other herb to help themſelves againſt their after-pains. Once more, Naturaliſts obſerve,<note place="margin">A partu duas habent herbas quae Aros &amp; Seſelis appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamur. <hi>Plin. l. 8. c. 32.</hi>
                     </note> that they uſually bring forth at that time of the year when there is much thunder, according to that before mentioned (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 29.) <hi>The voice of the Lord, (or thunder) ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the Hinds to calve.</hi> For the Hind being of a fearful nature,
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:48669:171"/> that dreadful noiſe doth ſo aſtoniſh her, that it either makes her put out all her ſtrength to bring forth, or makes her leſs ſenſible of her pains in bringing forth. That's the ſecond thing here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable in Hinds, their painful bringing forth, <hi>They bow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they bring forth their young ones, they caſt out their ſorrows.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence take this inference, with reſpect to women who come under the like pains. This ſhould be a ſtaff of conſolation to them, in the time of their travel. If the Lord directs theſe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to the beſt poſture, and moſt proper means for their help and eaſe in that condition, how much more will he take care of them, eſpecially of them who call upon him, and truſt in him? We may well make that interpretation of the Apoſtles words (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.15.) <hi>She ſhall be ſaved in child-bearing, if they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in faith, and charity, and holineſs, with ſobriety.</hi> This early care of God for mankind, is deſcribed (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.9, 10.) <hi>Thou art he that took me out of the womb; I was caſt upon thee from the womb; thou art my God from my mothers belly.</hi> And again (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 71.6.) <hi>By thee have I been holden up from the womb; thou art he that took me out of my mothers bowels; my praiſe ſhall be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually of thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> applies this matter of the Hinds bringing forth, to the ſpiritual birth; Firſt, Becauſe the time is unknown, or known only to God, when any ſoul comes to the new birth. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Becauſe every ſoul which travelleth with this new birth, boweth and humbleth himſelf greatly under the ſenſe of ſin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord.

According to every degree of life, God provides ſutable food; the Infant ſhall have milk, and when a little grown, ſtronger meat.

                     </note> and now ſet free? I anſwer, The Lord ſpeaks thus figuratively, not that the wilde Aſs was ever in bonds, but that becauſe he is ſo untractable, and will by no means be mannag'd, he ſeems to be as one looſed from bonds, even as Oxen and Horſes which ſerve man, and are under his power, ſeem bound to his ſervice. So then, as the former, ſo this latter part of the verſe is not to be expounded, as if the wilde Aſs had ever been under reſtraint, and afterwards was ſent forth free and looſed from his bonds, but both expreſſions intend only, that as his diſpoſition is for free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, ſo in his condition he is, and alwayes hath been, free from bondage; for not only is he free from bondage, who having been in bondage is delivered, as ſlaves and captives oftentimes are; but he may be ſaid to be free from bondage, or to have his bonds looſed, who was never in bonds, who was either born free, or who by his wit, skill and policy, or the help of others, hath been preſerved from bondage. A man may be ſaid to be free from ſickneſs, that never was ſick, as well as he that is reſtored from ſickneſs to health; and ſo a man that never was in bonds, may be ſaid to be free from bonds, as well as he that is delivered from bondage. Thus the wilde Aſs in the Text is ſaid to have his bonds looſed, though he never was in bonds. As the Lord hath made all creatures, ſo he hath made ſome free, others ſervile; he hath ſet ſome at liberty, but holds others at hard labour all their dayes, in drawing, travelling, or bearing heavy burdens. The words are plain; the ſum and ſcope of them may be thus conceived: As if the Lord had asked <hi>Job,</hi> by whom this natural inclination was given to the wilde Aſs, that he ſhould ſo earneſtly deſire liberty; as alſo, who gave him that fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ce and ſtoutneſs, that he ſhould be able to live without Law, to follow his own luſt, not at all ſubmitting to, nor guided by the will of others. <hi>Who hath ſent out the wilde Aſs free?</hi>

                  <pb n="328" facs="tcp:48669:174"/>

<q>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> That ſome creatures are free from, and others bound to ſervice, is of Gods own appointment.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It would be both a vanity and a high preſumption, to ask the reaſon why the Lord hath appointed ſome creatures to ſpend the whole time of their lives in liberty, and that others ſhould be continually groaning under bondage, labouring and ſweating, tyring and wearying themſelves out in the ſervice of men, ſeeing we cannot change the orders of God. And as we muſt not buſie our ſelves with enquiring, why he hath not ſubjected the wilde Aſs to the ſame bonds and burdens as he hath tame Aſſes? So we muſt not ſay unto God, why haſt thou made ſome men to ſerve, others to rule? no, nor why he handles ſome men more gently, others more grievouſly? We muſt reſolve all theſe queſtions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the will, dominion and ſoveraignty of God; and we may well conceive, that the Lord would in this queſtion about the wilde Aſſes, intimate unto us, as well as unto <hi>Job,</hi> that he hath a power in himſelf, which no man ought to queſtion, to free ſome men from the bonds of ſervice, and to bind others, to free ſome men from the bonds of affliction, ſorrow and trouble in this world, while others are hamper'd and held faſt in them all their dayes.

This was <hi>Jobs</hi> caſe; he was in the bonds and cords of affliction, while o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers enjoyed peace and liberty. Now man ought no more to queſtion the Lord, why one man is afflicted and another free, then why the wilde Aſs is free, and the tame a ſervant. As the whole
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:48669:174"/> creation (which was occaſionally ſhewed at the third verſe) is ſubject unto bondage, by reaſon of the ſin of man, and groaneth till it be delivered; ſo the ſoveraignty of God hath laid this bondage heavier upon ſome parts of the creation, or upon ſome creatures, than upon others. And as we ſhould daily and deeply bewail it, that our ſin hath brought bondage upon the creature, ſo we ſhould humbly ſubmit to whatſoever bondage or hard tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel the ſoveraignty of God hath deſigned us in one kind or other, while we are in this world.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Conſider to whom 'tis granted to be free, and to have their bonds looſed; it is to wilde Aſſes.</p>
                  <p>Then obſerve;
<q>To be free from labour and ſervice, is but a very low privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is but the priviledge of an Aſs; and as it is but a low pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge to be free from ſervice, ſo it is a great ſin to caſt off ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. Some under pretence of liberty, caſt off obedience, and will not bear the yoak of duty or good government; this is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to be free as the wilde Aſs is free. Such are ſpoken of (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.2, 3.) <hi>Come let us break their bonds, and caſt their cords from us.</hi> They that would break the bonds and cords there ſpoken of, deſire only, and look after a ſinful liberty, a meaner liberty than that of the wilde Aſs. The Prophet going to the great men (<hi>Jer.</hi> 5.5.) ſaid, <hi>Theſe have altogether broken the yoak, and burſt the bonds;</hi> that is, the yoak of duty which God hath laid upon them. They have no cauſe of boaſting, that are free from the bonds of ſervice; but they who caſt off the bonds of duty, have great cauſe to be aſhamed.

The Prophet (<hi>Jer.</hi> 2.24.) compares the whole people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when they caſt off the ſervice of God, to a <hi>wilde Aſs</hi> (which Scripture was toucht at the ſecond verſe upon another occaſion) <hi>that ſnuffeth up the wind at her pleaſure; in her occaſion who can turn her away? all they that ſeek her, will not weary themſelves, in her month they ſhall find her:</hi> There is no bringing ſuch into compaſs, till they are compaſſed with pains. We may call all ſuch <hi>nominal Iſraelites real Iſhmaelites,</hi> it being ſaid of <hi>Iſhmael (Gen.</hi> 16.12.) that he was (<hi>pere Adam) a wilde man,</hi> having more of the wilde Aſs than of the man in them. Thus it is with vain and unbridled ſpirits, they cannot bear the yoak of ſervice; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore remember, though this be ſpoken of as a priviledge, yet it is a low priviledge to be free from any honeſt ſervice; and to be be free from all ſervice, is worſe than the worſt of outward ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitudes. 'Tis a mercy to be free from ſlavery to man, but to be free from ſervice to man, is to be unmanly; every man ſhould be a ſervant in one kind or another, and therefore the Law ſaith, <hi>To call a man a ſervant,</hi> diſtinguiſheth no man, ſeeing every man is ſuppoſed in the way of his life a ſervant. The Apoſtle ſpeaking to thoſe whoſe very calling is to ſerve, and are therefore in ſtrict ſenſe called <hi>ſervants</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.21, 22.) ſaith, <hi>Art thou called, being a ſervant, care not for it</hi> (that is, be not troubled that thou art a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant (ſervice to man is not inconſiſtent with the ſervice of God) <hi>but if thou maiſt be made free, uſe it rather; for he that is called in the Lord, being a ſervant, is the Lords free man. Let every man</hi> (v. 24.) <hi>wherein he is called, therein abide with God;</hi> that is, let him continue to ſerve man in all things, according to the will of God.
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:48669:175"/> To be wholly free from the ſervice of man, is no better than the freedom of the worſer ſort of beaſts, the wilde Aſs. Chriſt (<hi>Mat.</hi> 11.29, 30.) calls his to the yoak; and Chriſts yoak implyeth all manner of dutiful ſervice, even ſervice to man as well as to God: <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and I will give you reſt; take my yoak upon you, and learn of me, &amp;c. for my yoak is eaſie, and my burden is light.</hi> If we refuſe Chriſts eaſie yoak, we may quickly get a heavy one, yea, an iron one, as the Prophet told him who broke the wooden one (<hi>Jer.</hi> 28.13.) There are ſome yoaks, which to bear is our honour; 'tis ſurely ſo, to bear the yoak of Chriſt; to be under Chriſts bonds, is a favour; woe to thoſe that ſeek to be looſed from them. The Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> tells us (<hi>Lam.</hi> 3.37.) <hi>It is good for a man to bear the yoak in his youth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is a threefold bond or yoak, from which it is a favour to be wholly freed, and that freedom we ſhould ſeek after; but neither of the three is a freedom from duty and ſervice, or from due ſervice.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To be free from the yoak of ſin, and to have the bonds of our iniquities looſed, that is a bleſſed priviledge (<hi>John</hi> 8.36.) <hi>If the Son make you free, you ſhall be free indeed.</hi> The chief part of a Sons freedom, which we have by <hi>Chriſt, the Son,</hi> is freedom from ſin. Freedom from the condemning power of ſin, and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from the ruling power of ſin, is our ſpiritual or Goſpel free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid to <hi>Simon Magus (Acts</hi> 8.23.) <hi>I perceive thou art in the gall of bitterneſs, and in the bond of iniquity;</hi> thou art ſtill a priſoner, a ſlave to ſin, the guilt of ſin holds thee faſt; nor art thou delivered from the filth of it. To have our ſin-bonds looſed, is to be free like Saints; to looſe our ſelves from duty-bonds, whether to God or man, is to be free like wilde Aſſes.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There is a great mercy in being looſed and made free from the curſe of the Law. Thus alſo the Son makes us free (<hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed us from the curſe of the Law, being made a curſe for us;</hi> that is, enduring the curſe for us, or dying acurſed death for us, that we might have, and for ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy a bleſſed life: This is a glorious liberty.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, To be freed from the old legal ceremonies, is the priviledge of all believers under the Goſpel; and 'tis ſuch a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge as the Apoſtle exhorted the <hi>Galatians,</hi> and us with them,
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:48669:176"/> to maintain with all our might (<hi>Gal.</hi> 5.1.) <hi>Stand faſt therefore in the liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made us free, and be not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled again with the yoak of bondage;</hi> that is, with the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of the ceremonial Law, from which Chriſt hath made us free (<hi>Gal.</hi> 4.26.) <hi>Jeruſalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all;</hi> free, Firſt, from the ſlavery of ſin; free, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, from the curſe of the Law; free, Thirdly, from the yoak of legal ceremonies. All believers are made thus free by Chriſt, but Chriſt hath not made ſo much as one believer free from ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. Chriſt makes us free to ſerve, not free from ſerving. <hi>To be be free to ſerve, is infinitely better than to be free from ſervice;</hi> nothing is more ingenuous, nothing ſhews a more noble ſpirit in man, than to be free to ſerve, as all are, being once freed from ſpiritual or ſin-ſlavery (<hi>Rom.</hi> 6.19.) <hi>As ye have yielded your members ſervants to uncleanneſs, and to iniquity unto iniquity, even ſo now yield your ſelves ſervants to righteouſneſs unto holineſs; for</hi> (as it follows) <hi>when ye were the ſervants of ſin, ye were free from righteouſneſs,</hi> or (as it is in the margin) <hi>free to righteouſneſs;</hi> not free to do righteouſneſs, but free not to do it. Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs had then no command (yielded to) no power (ſubmitted to) over you; whereas over a gracious heart, righteouſneſs hath the greateſt command. A godly man is at the beck of God, in all the wayes of righteouſneſs: and, as he is free to ſerve Maſters, ſo he is free to be ſubject to Magiſtrates, or higher powers, according to that rule of the Apoſtle (<hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1.) And that all in their places may be mindful of this duty, they are upon all occaſions to be put in mind of it, as the ſame Apoſtle directed <hi>Titus</hi> in his Epiſtle to him (<hi>Chap.</hi> 3.1.) The Lord having ſpoken of the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Aſs, proceeds to deſcribed his dwelling.</p>

                     </bibl> Whoſe houſe I have made the wilderneſs, and the barren laid his dwellings.</q>
                  <p>Theſe words contain the ſecond part of the care and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God towards the wild Aſs; he hath not only made them free, and looſed their bonds, but he hath provided a dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for them; and where? in the wilderneſs; a wild place, and therefore fit for wild beaſts. The wilderneſs; ſtrictly taken, is the dwelling of beaſts, not of men; we read (I grant) in Scripture not only of Houſes, but of Cities in the wilderneſs,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:48669:176"/> yet take the wilderneſs ſtrictly, and 'tis a place un-inhabited by man; and that's the place where the Lord hath appointed the wild Aſs to dwell; 'tis his houſe, there he abideth as men do in their houſes. The wilderneſs is a place undreſſed, untilled, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cared for by man, yet by the care and goodneſs of God it affords ſufficient proviſion for the ſupport of theſe creatures, whom no man provides for.</p>
                  <q>Whoſe houſe I have made the wilderneſs.</q>
                  <p>The wild Aſs hath a large and open houſe, ſome conceive the wilderneſs here intended was the wilderneſs of <hi>Arabia,</hi> which as (Hiſtorians tell us) was much ſtockt or abounded with wild Aſſes. The word <hi>Arabia</hi> ſignifies <hi>a wilderneſs;</hi> the whole coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try being ſo like a wilderneſs, is ſo called after its own likeneſs. The <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphraſt reads it, <hi>whoſe houſe I have made a plain,</hi> as if theſe <hi>wild Aſſes</hi> were in this oppoſed to the <hi>wild Goats, (ver.</hi> 1.) who live on high hills and craggy rocks. The word is tranſlated <hi>a plain (Deut.</hi> 1.1.) yet rather, as we, <hi>the wilderneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>And the barren land his dwellings; <hi>the</hi> Hebrew <hi>is,</hi> and the ſalt place his dwellings.</q>
                  <p>A barren place, and a ſalt place, are the ſame (<hi>Judg.</hi> 9.45.) <hi>When</hi> Abimeleck <hi>took that City, he ſowed it with ſalt,</hi> in token that an everlaſting curſe of barrenneſs ſhould come upon it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 107.34.) <hi>A fruitful land turned he into barrenneſs,</hi> the margin ſaith <hi>into ſaltneſs.</hi> Once more (<hi>Jer.</hi> 17.5, 6.) <hi>Curſed be the man that truſteth in man, and maketh fleſh his arm, he ſhall be like the heath in the deſert, and ſhall not ſee when good cometh, but ſhall inhabit the parched places in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, in a ſalt land and not inhabited,</hi> that is, in a barren land, unfit for any to inhabit. There is a reaſon in nature why ſalt land is barren; ſalt being hot and dry, draweth up the ſtrength and moiſture of the land that ſhould make is fruitful: This ſalt or barren land, which yeilds little graſs or herbage, the Lord hath appointed for the wild Aſs to dwell in.</p>
                  <p>Hence note, Firſt;
<q>God provides a place of dwelling for the meaneſt creatures.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Where the wild Aſs ſhall dwell or inhabit, comes under a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine appointment. How much more hath God appointed dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:48669:177"/> places for the children of men. The Apoſtle tells us (<hi>Acts</hi> 12.26.) That he hath not only made <hi>men to dwell on all the face of the earth,</hi> but <hi>he hath alſo determined the bounds of their habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> that is, God hath not only made the whole earth habitable for man-kind, but he hath by his providence diſpoſed every man to his ſpecial habitation in this or that part of the earth.</p>
                  <p>Secondly;
<q>The dwelling which God appoints to any creature is ſutable to its nature.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This wild creature dwells in a wild place, in a wilderneſs. This barren creature (as to any benefit he brings to man) God appoints to dwel in a barren land. It is ſaid of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar (Dan.</hi> 5.21.) when for his pride he was put from his dominion, that he had his dwelling with <hi>wild Aſſes;</hi> he himſelf carried it like a beaſt, and he had a dwelling ſutable to his beaſtial diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among the beaſts; he was proud, and would not bare the Lords yoke, he caſt off the bonds which God laid upon him, and thought it enough for him to lay bonds upon men, therefore the Lord (to humble him) thruſt him among the beaſts. As like will to like moſtly in way of election, ſo ſometimes like ſhall to like, though they like it not, in way of compulſion; and uſually like are put to like perſons or places, in way of gracious ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. God himſelf appoints wild beaſts to the barren wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, tame beaſts to the fruitful encloſed paſtures; he placeth men in well built Houſes, Towns or Cities; and he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed faithful men and women his Church to dwell in, which is therefore called (though in a wilderneſs) <hi>the houſe of God,</hi> (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15.) <hi>David</hi> found that houſe more pleaſing to him than any of his Royal Pallaces, and therefore made it his great requeſt, <hi>The one thing of his deſires (Pſal.</hi> 27.7.) <hi>That he might dwel in the houſe of the Lord for ever:</hi> Even as he bitterly complained (<hi>Pſalm</hi> 120.5,) <hi>Wo is me, that I ſojourn in</hi> Meſech, <hi>that I dwell in the tents of</hi> Kedar. And as the Lord hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided ſutable habitations for beaſts, wild and tame; for men, good and bad here on earth; ſo he hath provided ſutable habitations for all men, when they leave this earth. He hath provided hell for their houſe and dwelling place for ever, who are diſobedient <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

As now all godly men dwell in God by faith (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.1.) ſo they ſhall hereafter dwell always with him by fruition. He that gives the wilderneſs for a houſe, and the barren land for a dwelling to the wild Aſs, will provide a <hi>Paradiſe</hi> for the houſe, and a <hi>Spring-garden</hi> of everlaſting joys and ſweetneſſes for his faithful ſervants.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, From theſe words <hi>(the barren land his dwelling)</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note;
<q>As ſome lands are barren by a Divine Malediction, ſo ſome by Common Conſtitution.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some lands become barren by a curſe from God; Thus he <hi>turns a fruitful land into barrenneſs, for the wickedneſs of thoſe that dwell therein (Pſal.</hi> 107.34.) Now as ſome lands are made barren (beſides the general curſe which befel all lands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the fall of man into ſin) by ſome ſpecial curſe, for ſpecial cauſes, ſo, 'tis meerly an act of Divine Soveraignty, that ſome lands, as to their very ſoil and conſtitution are barren, while others are fruitful.</p>
                  <q>Fourthly, Conſider where do theſe Aſſes dwell? 'tis <hi>in a barren land.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>They that do little work deſerve but little reward, a barren land may ſerve them who refuſe ſervice.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>As every land, the beſt land is barren and unprofitable to them who will not take pains to improve it; ſo 'tis pity they ſhould dwell in a fruitful land, who will not take pains in it.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Note;
<q>There it no place ſo bad or barren, but it hath its uſe.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>God hath uſe for barren wilderneſſes, as well as for the richeſt paſtures.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, The wilde Aſs living according to nature, is ſatisfied with a barren Land.</p>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>Nature is content with a little.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>They have alwayes enough, who deſire no more.</hi> A cottage is as
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:48669:178"/> good as a Palace, and a barren Land as good as a fruitful one, to a contented mind. Yet I cannot approve either their principle or practice, who have a kind of ambition (poſſibly they call it ſelf-denial, and reckon it a high piece of their Religion) to dwell, as the wilde Aſs, in the wilderneſs; ſuch are thoſe popiſh vota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, called <hi>Hermites,</hi> from the wilderneſs where they dwell: Theſe in devotion (ſuch as it is) make the wilderneſs their houſe, and the barren Land their dwelling, that they may be free from the cares and temptations of this world; theſe retire themſelves utterly from converſe with man, that they may more freely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with God (an excellent end, but that way to it is no where commanded by God) Let ſuch remember, that God hath not appointed the wilderneſs and deſert places for mans dwelling, but for the dwelling of wilde beaſts:<note place="margin">Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>There are only two caſes wherein men ſhould deſire ſuch ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary places.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, In caſe of perſecution, to get out of the hands and reach of cruel men. Thus <hi>David</hi> deſired the wilderneſs (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.3, 4, 5, 6.) <hi>Becauſe of the voice of the enemy, becauſe of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the wicked; for they caſt iniquity upon me, and in wrath they hate me; my heart is ſore pained within me, and the terrors of death are fallen upon me,</hi> &amp;c. And what followeth? <hi>O that I had wings like a dove, for then would I flie away and be at reſt; Lo, then would I wander afar off, and remain in the wilderneſs.</hi> It is better to be in the wilderneſs among ſavage beaſts, than to live among beaſtly ſavage men. The Apoſtle (<hi>Heb.</hi> 11.38.) tells us the reaſon why many worthy ones of the Jewiſh Church (of whom the world was not worthy) inhabited the wilderneſs; <hi>They were ſtoned and ſawn aſunder, and were ſlain with the ſword,</hi> &amp;c. And what then? then they who remained alive, to avoid thoſe extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, avoided the ſociety of men, and wandred <hi>in deſerts, and in mountains, and in dens, and caves of the earth.</hi> In ſuch a hot day we may chuſe the ſhadow of a deſolate wilderne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s, rather than a City to dwell in. And thus it is ſaid (<hi>Rev.</hi> 12.13, 14.)
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:48669:178"/> 
                     <hi>When the Dragon</hi> (that is, Heatheniſh <hi>Rome) perſecuted the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> (that is, the Church) <hi>which brought forth the man-child; then to the woman were given two wings of a great Eagle</hi> (that is, ſufficient means, ſtrength and opportunity to make her eſcape) <hi>that ſhe might flee into the wilderneſs;</hi> which as it hath been often verified in a metaphorical ſenſe, Profeſſors then lying cloſe and retired in their ſeveral places, ſo it hath been true in the letter, the Church hath ſled into the wilderneſs for ſafety, and hath there been preſerved <hi>from the face of the Serpent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, We may deſire ſuch retirements to, and a dwelling in ſolitary places, in caſe of the extream wickedneſs of thoſe among whom we dwell; though they break not out into open perſecution, yet their evil converſation makes their ſociety in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t llerable. This cauſed the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> to cry out (<hi>Chap.</hi> 9.2.) <hi>O that I had a place in the wilderneſs, that I might leave my people and go from them</hi> (why?) <hi>for they be all adulterers, an aſſembly of treacherous men.</hi> For, as <hi>it is better to dwell in the corner of the houſe top, than with a brawling woman in a wilde houſe (Prov.</hi> 21.9.) ſo it is better to get into a corner, or into a wilderneſs, than to live in a City, or in the faireſt Palaces among men of wicked and ungodly ſpirits, ſuch as vexed <hi>Lot</hi> in <hi>Sodom</hi> (2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.8.)</p>
                  <p>In theſe two caſes we may imitate the wilde Aſs, and dwell in the wilderneſs; but for any to make it their choice, let them conſider where they have a rule for it. Man is a ſociable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ought to be helpful and uſeful to others, and not whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to confine himſelf to himſelf, as they do, who are and are called <hi>Anchorets</hi> and <hi>Hermites.</hi> To ſerve our Country, and to obſerve the Law of Nations for the common good of mankind, is better than upon any pretence of devotion, or converſe with God, to ſeclude our ſelves totally from the company and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe of men. And ſeeing God hath made us for the good of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſociety, it is inhumane, voluntarily and electively to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn and exempt our ſelves from the Laws of ſociety. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaid, concerning decliners of ſociety, <hi>He that affects ſolitude,</hi>

<pb n="338" facs="tcp:48669:179"/> and barren Land. And I have the rather touch it, becauſe I find the wits of ſome running ſomewhat wild in the Allegory of the wild Aſs in the Text, as if he were a very fitting reſemblance of a contemplative man.</p>
                  <p>I grant a godly man ſhould be, and the more godly any man is, the more he will be, I am ſure, the more he would or deſires to be free from the thoughts, and looſed from the bands both of love to, and cares about the things of this life, that he may be the more in the meditation of, and preparation for, a better life. In thoſe meditations he retires from the throng of worldly deſires, as much as a man living alone in a wilderne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

His ſoul ſearcheth after, and he feeds upon the green things which every where grow upon the mountains of the holy Scriptures, both for his inſtruction and conſolation. All this I grant, as was ſaid before, is true of a godly man raiſed to any high degree of ſpiritualneſs, and walking much in the Spirit. He is in the world, yet ſits looſe and free from the bands and baits of it. Howbeit, this warrants no man to looſe himſelf from all bands of ſervice in the world, much leſs to be ſo groſs, as lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to make that his houſe, which God hath made the houſe of the wilde Aſs, <hi>The wilderneſs, or to take the barren Land for his dwelling.</hi>

The Lord ſpeaks of this wilde Aſs after the manner of men, who laugh at thoſe things which they contemn, deſpiſe or ſcorn, as much below them or contrary to them: The word is rendred <hi>by laughing (Pſal.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Job</hi> 5.22.) It is ſaid alſo of the good woman (<hi>Prov.</hi> 31.25.) <hi>She ſhal rejoyce in time to come;</hi> which others render thus, <hi>She laughed at time to come;</hi> that is, ſhe having ſo well and wiſely provided for time to come, is not at all burdened
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:48669:179"/> with cares about it. There may be a double reaſon, why this wild Aſs <hi>ſcorns, or laughs at the multitude of the City.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe it is no way pleaſing to his nature, he hath no deſire to a City, to a ſociable life.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, He may be ſaid <hi>to ſcorn the multitude of the City,</hi> becauſe though a multitude ſhould come out of a City to take him, yea, as great a multitude as a City can make, yet he is not afraid, for he knows he can ſhew them a fair pair of heels, and by his ſwiftneſs of foot keep out of their hands, and maintain his liberty.</p>

                     </note> thoſe that exact Tribute; Secondly, thoſe who exact Labour. Now he that drives cattel, urgeth them to work both by hand and tongue, and ſo exacts labour of them. Hence the word is uſed to expreſs the <hi>Task-maſters</hi> of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in <hi>Egypt (Exod.</hi> 5.6.) who indeed exacted labour of them, and made them ſerve with rigor. From theſe Oppreſſors, with the Exactors of labour, the wild Aſs is free; he is at ſuch liberty, that he <hi>regards not the cry of the driver,</hi> Exactor or Oppreſſor; nor will he be brought to work by fair means nor by foul. As that was a proverbial ſpeech to ſhew the tranquility of thoſe times (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 14.8.) <hi>Since thou art laid down, no feller is come up againſt us;</hi> So this ſeems to be a proverbial ſpeech, ſhewing the liberty of the wild Aſs at all times, <hi>He regardeth not the crying of the Driver.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From the former part of the verſe,</p>
                  <p>When 'tis ſaid, <hi>He laughs at, or ſcorns the multitude of the City.</hi> Taking the word <hi>City,</hi> as oppoſed to the <hi>wilderneſs or barren Land,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note;
<q>Cities as they are full of company, ſo they are accompanied with all manner of outward plenty and fulneſs.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>If good things are to be had any where for love or money, it is in Cities; and therefore they who dwell in great Cities, where there is ſuch a multitude of people, and abundance of all things, ſhould remember their priviledge; 'tis a mercy they are not in a wilderneſs, or in a barren Land.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, In that it is ſaid, <hi>He ſcorns the multitude of the City,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note;
<q>No ſociety, no company pleaſeth, but that which is ſutable.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>What cares the wild Aſs for the company of men? he had rather be among the wild Aſſes, than among the beſt and wiſeſt men. Bad men, who are like wild beaſts, ſcorn the company of good men; and it is as true of good men, that they have no joy in the company of bad men, yea, they are often burdened with
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:48669:180"/> their company. The content of our lives doth very much conſiſt in our harmony with, and congeniality to thoſe whom the are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to converſe with.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Take the word in the other ſenſe, as noting the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance or plenty that is in the City, the wild Aſs had rather be in his barren Land than there.</p>
                  <p>Hence we learn;
<q>Liberty is more pleaſing than plenty, and a wilderneſs with poor fare, than a City where there is oppreſſion.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Better be ſometimes in a ſtarving condition, than alwayes in a fearing condition, alwayes hearing <hi>the cry of the Driver.</hi> The wild Aſs is content to fare hard, ſo he may be free: how much more then is he below a man, who parts with his true liberty, as <hi>Eſau</hi> did with his Birth-right, for a morſel of meat, or a meſs of broth?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Note;
<q>To be driven and forced, is grievous to beaſts, much more to men.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The wild Aſs regards not the crying of the Driver, becauſe he knows the Driver cannot reach him with his cry, much leſs with his whip. The tame Aſs muſt regard and attend the cry of the Driver (though he hath no will to it) whether he will or no. It was ſaid by the Moraliſts, <hi>Man would be led, not driven;</hi> perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, not compelled. The diſputes have been great what man may do, and how far he may go to that matter; but I ſhall not med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with it any further, than to ſay, that when Chriſt in the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſaid (<hi>Luke</hi> 14.23.) <hi>Compel them to come in,</hi> The compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion there intended, is only that of argumentation, exhortation and perſwaſion by his Miniſters, whoſe divine Rhetorick in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching ſinners to come in, and to be reconciled unto God, hath ſuch a power in it, as amounts unto, and may be called a compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. I grant, many uſe their liberty, or rather abuſe it, as an occaſion to the fleſh, and turn it into wantonneſs, theſe are indeed no better than <hi>wild Aſſes;</hi> and though they are ſuch as regard not the cry of the Driver, yet they need it.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Lord hath ſhewed <hi>Job</hi> the houſe and dwelling, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the liberties and priviledges of the wild Aſs; in the next
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:48669:181"/> verſe the Lord ſhews him the food or diet of the wilde Aſs.</p>

                  <p>This verſe tells us where the Lord hath made proviſion for the <hi>wild Aſs. The Range</hi> (or as ſome render, <hi>the ſearch) of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains is his paſture;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Inveſtigatio montium (eſt) paſcuum ejus, i. e. quicquid in montibus inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigari poteſt, id ei pabuli loco eſt. <hi>Bez.</hi>
                     </note> that is, whatſoever he ſearcheth and findeth out upon the mountains, <hi>is his paſture. Job</hi> ſpeaketh of wicked men (Chap. 24.5.) after the manner of theſe wild Aſſes, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing food in the wilderneſs for themſelves, and for their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
                  <q>The range of the mountains is his paſture.</q>
                  <p>Some interpret it <hi>choice things,</hi> that is, the beſt things, or thoſe things that are moſt ſavoury to the pallat of that beaſt, thoſe he picks up for his food. Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi> tranſlates, <hi>Choſen places in the mountains are for his paſture:</hi> As if it had been ſaid, <hi>Though he be wilde, yet he is prudent, he takes not what comes next,</hi> but he chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth what is beſt for him; for as it followeth,
<q>He ſearcheth after every green thing.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The word notes a very diligent ſearch, <hi>after every green thing.</hi> Green things are his delicacies, he lives upon them, and delights in them; he ſearcheth after all, and feeds upon that which is beſt for him; he looks not that man ſhould fodder him in winter, as they do tame and working cattel, he looks out his own living, and picks up ſome green thing or other all the year long.</p>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>Where God gives dwelling, he gives feeding.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>God hath made the <hi>wilderneſs and barren places</hi> for the wild Aſs to dwell in, yet there is ſomething for him to feed on.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>His food is every green thing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(Whence learn;
<q>God gives food to all creatures convenient to their nature.)</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He gives green things, graſs to the beaſts of the field; but he doth, not feed man with graſs, he feedeth man with the fineſt of the wheat, and with honey out of the rock (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.16.) And as the Lord provides ſutable food for the bodies of men, ſo
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:48669:181"/> for their ſouls he hath ſpiritual green paſtures for them (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 23.1, 2.) <hi>The Lord is my Shepherd, I ſhall not want; he maketh me to lye down in green paſtures;</hi> that is, in his Word and Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. They are green paſtures for his people; he makes them lie down in the Promiſes and in the Commandments, in the holy Prophecies and Hiſtories of the written word; all which are written for our <hi>inſtruction or learning, that we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures, might have hope (Rom.</hi> 15.4.) that is, that our faith having the truth of the Word (eſpecially in the promiſes) to feed upon, our hope may be ſaid to wait for the good of the Word patiently. The holy Scriptures (I ſay) are the green paſtures which the Lord hath provided for the ſouls of men to feed in, and grow fat upon. The Scriptures are a bare common, a dry heath to unbelievers, they find nothing there which is food for them; but to believers they are fat paſtures, and full of ſuch green things as are moſt ſutable to their taſte, and nouriſhing to their ſouls. Thus ſpake the Prophet (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.9, 10.) <hi>Their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures ſhall be in all high places; they ſhall not hunger nor thirſt, neither ſhall the heat nor the Sun ſmite them;</hi> that is, they ſhall have ſafe paſſage, and ſufficient food, both for ſoul and body, for their ſouls eſpecially, when delivered out of their ſoul-priſons, or ſpiritual captivity, there ſpoken or prophecyed of, under the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Wild Aſſes ſea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ch <hi>after every green thing,</hi> they take pains for their living; i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> it be not neer, they will travel for it, and ſeek after it.</p>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>Hunger makes irrational creatures, every living creature, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>They who love not labour, will yet take ſome pains, at leaſt ſo much as ſerves them to get food, and keep them alive. Thoſe beaſts which are moſt at liberty, are in a kind of bondage to their bellies. <hi>The wild Aſſes</hi> (ſaith the Prophet, (<hi>Jer.</hi> 14.6.) <hi>did ſtand in the high places, they ſnuffed up the wind like Dragons, becauſe there was no graſs.</hi> How will they ſearch after graſs, who are thus afflicted for want of graſs! And will not ſpiritual hunger make us as induſtrious as natural hunger doth? Hungry ſouls will be ſeeking after every green thing, after every divine precept,
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:48669:182"/> after very precious promiſe; theſe are the green things which the ſoul ſearcheth for, and is ſatisfied with. Naturaliſts ſay of the wild Aſs, that he utterly refuſeth to feed upon thoſe things that are dry and dead, he muſt have g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>een. That's true of every be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, he cannot feed upon dead and dry things, upon what is chaffy and husky, he muſt have green, ſappy, juicy, lively food; ſuch hath God provided for him, and he will be ſatisfied with none but ſuch.</p>

                  <p>THe Lord ſtill enquires after <hi>Jobs</hi> skill and knowledge in the book of the creatures. In the former context, <hi>Job</hi> was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogated about the wild Aſs, whoſe freedom was there ſet out, in oppoſition to the ſervitude of the home-bred, or tame Aſs. Here the Lord puts the queſtion about the Unicorn, and ſets forth his liberty, in oppoſition to the ſervile labour of the Ox.</p>

                  <p>The Unicorns liberty is here deſcribed, firſt, more generally, in two things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, He will do no work for man.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, He will receive no reward from man.</p>
                  <p>That he hath no mind to work for man, is ſhewed in the firſt words of the verſe: <hi>Will he be willing to ſerve thee?</hi> Will he be imployed in thy ſervice?</p>
                  <pb n="345" facs="tcp:48669:182"/>
                  <p>And that he cares not to be fed or provided for by man, that he looks for no reward from man, is ſet down in the latter part of the verſe; <hi>Will he abide by thy crib?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, The ſtubborn liberty of the Unicorn is deſcribed in this context, more particularly, by his refuſal of that ſpecial la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour which is neceſſary in husbandry, or for the tillage of the ground, in the whole compaſs of it; and here are three parts of that labour ſet down, all refuſed by the Unicorn.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The ploughing of the ground in the 10th verſe; <hi>Canſt thou bind the Vnicorn with his band in the furrow?</hi> He will not go to plough.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond labour with which beaſts are wrought in husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry, is harrowing the ground; the Unicorn will not touch that, as 'tis ſaid in the cloſe of the 10th verſe, <hi>Will he harrow the valleys after thee?</hi> No, he will neither plough nor harrow, he will do none of theſe works though he have ſtrength enough to do them, as appears (<hi>verſ.</hi> 11.) <hi>Wilt thou truſt him, becauſe his ſtrength is great? or wilt thou leave thy labour to him?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third part of husbandry, about which beaſts are uſed, is the bringing of the Corn in, or the home-bringing of it; the Unicorn will lend no help to that work neither, as is ſhewed in the 12th verſe, <hi>Wilt thou believe him that he will bring home thy ſeed, and gather it into thy barn?</hi>

                  <p>Thus the Unicorn will neither ſerve in general, nor do any of theſe particular ſervices; he will neither plough nor harrow, nor bring home the ſeed. The Unicorn is a beaſt unſubject to, and unſubduable by man, yet ſubject to God, and by him eaſily ſubduable; for (as the Apoſtle ſpake in another caſe, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.21.) <hi>He is able to ſubdue all things to himſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We may conceive, the ſcope and intendment of the Lord in putting theſe queſtions to <hi>Job</hi> about the Unicorn, was to ſhew, that if he could not time or reduce ſuch a creature as the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corn to his Plow and Harrow, then he muſt not think of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God to his bow, who made both the Unicorn and man too. Surely God will be at his liberty, to do with man what he pleaſeth, do man what he can, ſeeing the Unicorn will take liberty to do what he pleaſeth, notwithſtanding all that man can do. God will not be bound up to, nor tyed by any mans dictates, but remains ſoveraignly free for ever, in all his diſpenſations. Thus of the

                     </note>) where ſpeaking of this beaſt <hi>(Reem)</hi> he ſeems to ſay that he hath more horns than one, therefore no Unicorn; for there deſcribing the flouriſhing and powerful eſtate of the Tribe of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>his horns are like the horns of an Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corn;</hi> as if that beaſt (whatſoever it is which is ſignified by that Hebrew word) had more horns than one. We indeed tranſlate both words plurally, not <hi>the horns of an Vnicorn,</hi> but <hi>the horns of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nicorns,</hi> yet the Hebrew is ſingular. However I conceive this objection is of no weight, to the denial of any ſuch creature as the Unicorn, it being frequent in Scripture to put the ſingular number for the plural, as there Unicorn for Unicorns; and therefore that Text hath little or no force in it to invalidate their opinion, who aſſert that there is ſuch an one horned animal.</p>
                  <p>Now as to the Text in hand, it may ſuffice my purpoſe (leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing farther ſearch of theſe things to Naturaliſts) to ſay, that the Hebrew word <hi>Reem</hi> ſignifies a wild beaſt, very fierce and furious, uſually called an Unicorn, or expreſſed by a word ſignifying a beaſt having but one horn in Greek, Latine, and Engliſh.</p>
                  <p>But though I ſhall not deliver any opinion of my own to the contrary, yet I ſuppoſe it will not be unpleaſing to the ingenuous and learned Reader, if before I proceed with my own medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, upon what is ſaid in this <hi>Chapter,</hi> about this creature, I here inſert the diſcourſe and opinion of that learned Phyſitian, and Divine Critick, <hi>Doctor Arnoldus Bootius,</hi> in the third Book of his Sacred Animadverſions upon the Hebrew Text of the Old Teſtament, and the firſt <hi>Chapter</hi> of that Book: The ſubſtance of which I have gathered, and in moſt places tranſlated word for word, as followeth</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>That the word <hi>Reem</hi> (ſaith he) is the name of ſome certain Animal all Writers agree; but what this Animal is, is not agreed. <hi>Hierome</hi> renders it ſometimes a Rhinocerote, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times an Unicorn; and ſo do ſome others in tranſlating the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. <hi>Pagnine</hi> tranſlates it only once a <hi>Rhinocerote,</hi> in all other places where it occurs, an <hi>Vnicorn;</hi> yet in his Dictionary he ſeems to incline, that the word ſignifyeth a <hi>Rhinocerote,</hi> rather
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:48669:184"/> than an <hi>Vnicorn.</hi> But the Greeks generally are more conſtant in rendring it an <hi>Vnicorn,</hi> than a <hi>Rhinocerote;</hi> and in this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all interpreters, both they who tranſlate the Scriptures in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Latine tongue, and they who tranſlate them into their Mother tongue, follow them, and do ſo too; the <hi>Rabbins</hi> alſo go the ſame way. And therefore one of them writing upon thoſe words of <hi>Moſes</hi> concerning <hi>Joſeph (Deut.</hi> 33.17.) <hi>His horns are like the horns of</hi> (Reem) <hi>an Vnicorn</hi> (which ſeems to oppoſe this opinion which makes Reem to be the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corn, a beaſt of one horn; he I ſay, to avoid this difficulty) ſaith that place is to be underſtood by an Enallage or change of the number, the word <hi>Reem</hi> Unicorn, being put for <hi>Reemim,</hi> Unicorns; with which anſwer ſeveral others wipe of that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</p>
                     <p>Nor doth it a little help this interpretation that moſt of thoſe marks, which the Scripture takes notice of in that beaſt called <hi>Reem,</hi> namely, his extream fierceneſs, great ſtrength, and the extraordinary magnitude of his horn, are all aſcribed by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors to the Unicorn.</p>
                     <p>Yet to me this interpretation ſeems the leſs probable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Unicorns are found only in <hi>India,</hi> ſay they, who have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of them.

And it muſt needs be, that he was there (and to them) unknown, if no Country nearer than <hi>India</hi> produced the Unicorn; for the world was not ſo diſcovered in thoſe times, by mutual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, that living creatures, and things proper to Nations, ſhould be familiarly or much known, in Nations far remote. Of this we have a clear inſtance in the Elephant, of which famous animal, ſo uſeful to man for various ſervices, and ſo abounding in many parts of <hi>Africa</hi> and <hi>Aſia,</hi> the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſeem to have had little or no knowledge at all; which we may well conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture by that deep ſilence in Scripture concerning him, there being no mention made of the Elephant any where but in the book of <hi>Job:</hi> And <hi>Job</hi> was not an <hi>Iſraelite,</hi> nor an inhabitant of <hi>Canaan,</hi> but of <hi>Arabia;</hi> whoſe neighbours on the other ſide of the Red-ſea, the <hi>Aethiopians</hi> and <hi>Troglodites</hi> abounded with
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:48669:185"/> Elephants. And this is the more to be marvelled at, becauſe Ivory, which is nothing elſe but an Elephants tooth, was ſo well known and common in <hi>India.</hi> Now, if the Elephant, of whoſe teeth they had plenty, and which were bred in great numbers in Countries much nearer than <hi>Judea,</hi> was ſo little known to the <hi>Jews,</hi> who can believe that the Unicorn, which was proper to <hi>India,</hi> ſhould be known to them?</p>
                     <p>But we have another, and that a ſtronger argument, againſt this interpretation; namely, that we account the report of this Unicorn to be a meer fable, and that no ſuch animal, as this is deſcribed and commonly believed to be, is at preſent in the the world, or ever was. For <hi>Cleſias,</hi> a moſt vain man, and who, moved only with a love to lying, hath b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>And that <hi>Cleſias</hi> lied, as in many other things, ſo in this alſo, we may hence conjecture, becauſe this animal was never ſeen at <hi>Rome;</hi> in whoſe ſhews, all the rareſt animals which this half part of the world, containing <hi>Aſia,</hi> with <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> ever produced, were wont to be preſented to publick vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

                        <pb n="351" facs="tcp:48669:185"/> who writes that he had ſeen two. But it weakens his credit in this report, both that he is found in other matters to tell fables for truths, as alſo, becauſe what he ſaith of the Unicorn, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers ſo much from what hath been ſaid by others. Certain it is, that <hi>Garcias ab Horto,</hi> in thoſe many years which he ſpent in <hi>India,</hi> as Phyciſian to the Kings Vicegerent (in all which time, he had great acquaintance with very many learned men of that Country, and had the favour of their Kings, and was himſelf a moſt diligent ſearcher after ſuch like matters, He, I ſay) did not only not ſee any Unicorn there, but could not get any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain information concerning him; only he met with ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who told him, that in the furtheſt parts of <hi>Africa</hi> they had ſeen a beaſt having but one horn. Yet, ſuppoſe theſe men told him the truth, it makes nothing as to the Unicorn ſo much ſpoken of, with which that, according to their obſervation, hath little agreement; that being an <hi>Amphibion,</hi> and having a horn not paſſing two handfuls in length. My own Country-man alſo, <hi>Johannes Hugonis Linſchotius,</hi> who was an induſtrious inquirer after Natural things, having reſided twelve whole years in the City <hi>Goa,</hi> one of the moſt famous among all the Cities of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> and to which is brought whatſoever is rare and of eſteem in thoſe Countries, did never ſee an Unicorn, nor yet hear by any worthy of credit, that there was any ſuch animal in all thoſe parts, and therefore accounts the report of an Unicorn to be meerly fabulous; as may appear by what he writes in the 47th <hi>Chapter</hi> of his <hi>Itinerary;</hi> where ſpeaking of the <hi>Rhinocerote</hi> he ſaith, that is taken by many for the <hi>Monocerote</hi> or <hi>Vnicorn:</hi> Foraſmuch as no other <hi>Vnicorn</hi> is found or known, but only in reports and pictures.</p>
                     <p>We have ſhewed what moveth us not to aſſent to them, who ſay, that by the word <hi>Reem,</hi> we are to underſtand the <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corn.</hi> And they who render it the <hi>Rhinocerote,</hi> may with no l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ſs eaſe be refuted. And the firſt argument brought againſt the former expoſition, may ſerve here; ſeeing the <hi>Rhinocerote</hi> is only bred in thoſe remoteſt parts of the Eaſt, <hi>Bengata, Patane</hi> and <hi>Cambaya,</hi> all which lye beyond the River <hi>Ganges,</hi> in the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt <hi>India.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But beſides this, there are two other unanſwerable arguments againſt that interpretation.</p>
                     <pb n="352" facs="tcp:48669:186"/>
                     <p>Firſt, From their horns. Thoſe animals called <hi>Reem</hi> have very large horns, but the <hi>Rhinocerotes</hi> have very ſmall ones: And though <hi>Martial</hi> the Poet ſeems to ſay the contrary, while ſpeaking of the <hi>Rhinocerote,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>How powerful was he with his horn, who could toſs a Bull with it like a Ball!</hi> And though <hi>Nicolaus Contius</hi> in his <hi>Itinerary,</hi> reports it as long as a mans arm, yet experience and eye-ſight have confuted them; to which it appears, that the horn of the <hi>Rhinocerote</hi> is very thick and ſtrong at the root, yet very ſhort: For <hi>Geſner</hi> tells us, that his horn planted upon his Noſe, riſeth no higher than his Ears, and therefore it cannot be long. <hi>Bucer</hi> makes uſe of this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in his Commentary upon the 2d <hi>Pſalm,</hi> affirming that the hight of the horn, aſcribed to that animal the <hi>Reem,</hi> will not agree with the <hi>Rhinoceros.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Second argument is grounded upon the unconquerable fierceneſs of that animal called <hi>Reem;</hi> whereas the <hi>Rhinocerote,</hi> though with ſome difficulty, may be in ſome meaſure tamed, as hath been ſeen in thoſe at ſeveral times brought into <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus laying aſide (for the reaſons forementioned) that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, which makes this <hi>Reem</hi> to be either the Unicorn or the Rhinocerote, we are now to conſider what animal this <hi>Reem</hi> ſhould be: And ſurely it cannot but be ſome beaſt <hi>(Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulo generi affinis)</hi> of the race of Bulls or Bullocks; ſeeing in many places of Scripture, mention is made of the <hi>Reemim</hi> and Bullocks together, as intimating that they are animals of a near cognation or likeneſs, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.19. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.6. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 34.6, 7. In this laſt place the Prophet having named three living Creatures of one kind (<hi>ver.</hi> 6.) to wit, <hi>Lambs, and Goats, and Rams;</hi> Reaſon may perſwade our belief, that in the 7th or fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>verſe</hi> (which ſeems to run parallel with the former) the Prophet obſerves the ſame rule of ſpeaking; and to thoſe two <hi>Bullocks and Bulls,</hi> joyns this third called <hi>Reemim,</hi> being beaſts belonging, at leaſt, to the ſame kind with them.</p>
                     <p>I find the ſame confirmed <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. by comparing thoſe words of the 12. <hi>verſe, Many Bulls have compaſſed me; ſtrong Bulls of</hi> Baſhan <hi>have beſet me round;</hi> with thoſe of the 21. (which anſwer them) <hi>Save me from the Lions mouth, hear me</hi> (we read, <hi>thou haſt heard me) from the horns of the Reemims</hi>
                        <pb n="353" facs="tcp:48669:186"/> (we rendred Unicorns) as if the Pſalmiſt intended under the word <hi>Reemim,</hi> a ſort of beaſts much like in kind, if not of the ſame kind, with the Bullocks and ſtrong Bulls of <hi>Baſhan,</hi> ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of before (as the learned Author endeavours there to make out more largely and diſtinctly) to whom I refer the Reader.</p>
                     <p>By what hath been ſaid, I ſuppoſe we have made it appear plainly, that the beaſt meant by this word <hi>Reem,</hi> is an animal neer in kind to the Bull or Bullock, which can be no other than a wild Bull or Bullock, which is to other Bulls or Bullocks, as wild Swine, B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ars or Sows, are to thoſe which are tame, or live and feed about our houſes. But ſeeing there are ſeveral ſorts of theſe wild Bulls or Bullocks, we do not conceive the word <hi>Reem,</hi> to be a common appellation which may be given to them all, but that it ſignifies ſome one certain ſort among them. To find out which, will not be hard to thoſe who conſider what the Scripture holds out concerning the beaſt there called <hi>Reem;</hi> namely, the eminent greatneſs of his horns, and the eminent greatneſs of his ſtrength; both which are aſcribed to him, not only <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> 33.17. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. but <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92.10. <hi>My horn ſhalt thou exalt, like to the horn of a Reem; i. e.</hi> Thou ſhalt exalt it greatly and ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, even like the horn of a <hi>Reem.</hi> This makes it evident, that this <hi>Reem</hi> cannot be that beaſt which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> calls <hi>Bonaſus,</hi> nor that which later Writers call <hi>Bubalus</hi> or <hi>Bufalus</hi> (we in Engliſh, a <hi>Buffe</hi>) which is ſo far from being better fitted by his horns, for fight and force, than our Bulls, that his horns are indeed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unfit for either; as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſhews (<hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de part. Anim. cap.</hi> 2.) his horns being turned inward, and one againſt the other, and therefore (as he ſaith, <hi>lib.</hi> 9. <hi>Hiſt. Animal. cap.</hi> 45.) are unuſeful for his own defence. The horns indeed of ſome of thoſe beaſts, are of another faſhion, as <hi>Geſner</hi> deſcribes them, and alſo <hi>Scaliger, Exerc.</hi> 206. <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. but all concludes them unfit to fight with, becauſe they all are either turned one againſt another, or point downward.</p>
                     <p>Now though this beaſt which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> calls <hi>Bonaſus,</hi> others <hi>Bubalus</hi> or <hi>Bufalus,</hi> be of ſuch great ſtrength, as alſo of ſuch fierceneſs and untractableneſs, as may well ſuit the deſcription which the Scripture gives of the <hi>Reem;</hi> yet the form and faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his horns will by no means comply with it, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:48669:187"/> it muſt be granted, that they who have expounded <hi>Reem</hi> by that beaſt, have ſpoken more probably, and have come much neerer the truth, than they who underſtand by it, either the Unicorn or the <hi>Rhinocerote.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There remains two ſorts of wild Oxen, Bulls or Bullocks, the <hi>Vrus</hi> and <hi>Biſons;</hi> which latter is ſo like the <hi>Bonaſus,</hi> that by ſome he is taken for the ſame; yet between the <hi>Biſons,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo called, and the <hi>Bonaſus</hi> of <hi>Bufalus,</hi> their horns make a very remarkable difference. What the form of the horns of the <hi>Bufalus</hi> is, hath been ſhewed; but the <hi>Biſons</hi> have them a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle bowing in the top or point, in which reſpect they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared by <hi>Oppianus</hi> to brazen fiſh-hooks, but in the reſt or body of them they ſpread upward, or ſtand right up, and not ſo unfit to fight with, inſomuch that ſome have called them <hi>(Leth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And though we grant to <hi>Geſner</hi> (who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyeth the <hi>Bonaſi</hi> and <hi>Biſontes</hi> to differ <hi>in ſpecie</hi>) that the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence which is between the horns of theſe two beaſts, is not ſufficient to conſtitute a ſpecifical difference between them; yet when beſides the difference in their horns, there are other conſtant differences, as namely, that the beaſt called <hi>Bonaſus</hi> doth not fight with his head, but with his heels, and runs away as ſoon as wounded (as <hi>Ariſtotl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                        </hi> reports of him, <hi>lib.</hi> 9. <hi>Hiſt. cap.</hi> 45.) whereas the beaſt called <hi>Biſons,</hi> uſeth his horns only in ſight, and is not at all diſcouraged by being wounded, but like a Boar or a Lion, aſſaults his purſuers the more fiercely (as is ſet forth at large by <hi>Sigiſmundus Liber, in Muſcovieticis</hi>) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may well conclude, that there is a ſpecifical difference between theſe animals.</p>
                     <p>Now though the beaſt called <hi>Biſons,</hi> conſidering the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſtrength of his horns, as alſo his fierceneſs, might be taken for the beaſt in <hi>Job,</hi> called <hi>Reem,</hi> yet he is not that beaſt, becauſe he may be tamed by the art of man, and made to put off his fierceneſs; as appears abundantly out of a good Author. But as for the beaſt called <hi>Reem,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Panſoni as in Phocicis.</note> he never gives over the fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his nature, nor can he be tamed or brought to hand; as appears fully, by what God ſaith of him in this 39th Chapter of the book of <hi>Job.</hi> In which, when God had propoſed the more remarkable properties of ſeveral creatures to the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of <hi>Job,</hi> he brings in this beaſt, called <hi>Reem,</hi> only to ſet
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:48669:187"/> forth this property, the unſubduable or untameable fierceneſs of his nature. So that all that God ſaith of him, may be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to this; That the <hi>Reem</hi> can neither by the skill nor power of man be brought to the yoak, nor made ſerviceable to man in any way, when as many other wild beaſts, no leſs eminent than he for ſtrength and fierceneſs, even Lions, Tygers, Elephants, Leopards, Bears, Rhinocerotes, have laid down their immani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and become mild, and have ſuffered themſelves to be man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged and governed by men, yea, and learn to acknowledge their Maſters, and ſerve them; whereas ſuch tractableneſs might rather be expected from the <hi>Reem</hi> (he being of the Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks kind, and living upon graſs) than from any of them; all which, except the Elephant and Rhinocerote are ravenous, and delighting in blood and ſlaughter, live upon ſpoyl and prey.</p>
                     <p>And that we may the more wonder at the unſubduable na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the <hi>Reem,</hi> the Lord ſhews the ſame to be in the wild Aſs, a weak and ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>mleſs animal, and which hath neither ſtrength nor inclination to do hurt; than which nothing can be ſaid or imagined more wonderful, that wild Aſſes, whole flocks of which, even a ſingle boy will put to flight and chaſe, yet will by no means be tamed, whereas Tygers and Lions, one of which will ſtand a band of armed men, and ſometimes put them to flight, ſhould notwithſtanding be tamed, even to yield ſervile obedience. No other reaſon can be given of this, but only, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it hath ſeemed good to God, the Author of nature, to order it ſo.</p>
                     <p>Now in that God is pleaſed to diſcover the untameable na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the <hi>Reem</hi> by theſe marks or ſigns, namely, that he ſcorns to plow the ground, or do any work that belongs to Husbandry. Hence it doth more clearly appear, which we have above con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by many Scriptures, that the <hi>Reem</hi> is an animal of the ſame kind with Bullocks; foraſmuch as the ſenſe of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of God about him, is as if he had ſaid, Seeing among thoſe beaſts which are prepared by men to help them in their work, and whoſe labour they eaſe in tilling and ſubduing the earth, <hi>the Ox is chief,</hi> as being mans moſt laborious helper in husbandry, and which in moſt Countreys is more uſed in it than any other beaſt, according to that (<hi>Prov.</hi> 14.4.) <hi>Much encreaſe is by the ſtrength of the Ox.</hi> How comes it to paſs, that men do
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:48669:188"/> not make uſe of the <hi>Reem</hi> for thoſe ſervices, ſeeing he is of the ſame kind with Oxen, and ſo may ſeem to be made by nature for that purpoſe as much as other Oxen, and is by ſo much the fitter for that ſervice, than any other Oxen or Bulls whatſoever, by how much his ſtrength is greater than theirs, yet no man at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to uſe him in it; or if any did, it were to no purpoſe, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as I the Lord of nature have created this beaſt, as alſo the wild Aſs before ſpoken of, altogether untameable. This ſeems to be the meaning of God in his diſcourſe about the <hi>Reem.</hi> And hence alſo it appears, that the <hi>Reem</hi> is not the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> ſeeing he, as well as many other wild beaſts, being skilfully handled, proves tame and gentle, and may be formed to the uſe and obedience of man.</p>
                     <p>It remains therefore, that this <hi>Reem</hi> is the beaſt called <hi>Vrus,</hi> becauſe this property of untameableneſs is aſcribed to that beaſt. <hi>Caeſar</hi> in his 6th book of the <hi>Gallican</hi> war, ſaith, The <hi>Vri,</hi> no not the young ones, will not be tamed by men, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being caught in pits, they are killed. <hi>Pliny</hi> alſo ſaith as much of them, <hi>Lib.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 21.</p>
                     <p>And as in this particular, his untameable wildneſs, there is a full agreement between the <hi>Vrus</hi> and <hi>Reem,</hi> ſo thoſe other things which the Scripture ſpeaks of the <hi>Reem</hi> agree to him alſo, as thoſe forreign Authors witneſs, who have written his Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. For <hi>Ceſar</hi> writes, that he is in bigneſs, little leſs than an Elephant, but of the kind, colour and figure, or ſhape of a Bull. And <hi>Pliny</hi> in two places (<hi>lib.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 15. <hi>lib.</hi> 28. <hi>cap.</hi> 10.) names wild Oxen as the <hi>Genus,</hi> with reſpect both to the <hi>Vri</hi> and <hi>Biſontes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The learned Doctor adds many more proofs out of ancient Authors, which the Reader may peruſe, if he pleaſe, at his lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. And from all he concludeth,</p>
                     <p>It is not therefore to be doubted, but that the <hi>Reems</hi> are the <hi>Vri;</hi> and indeed ſo much the leſs, becauſe not only the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Regions (in divers parts of which, it is ſaid by Writers, that not only the <hi>Biſontes,</hi> but <hi>Vri,</hi> are found at this day) are the proper ſoyl where theſe Animals are bred, but the Eaſtern parts alſo bring them forth. <hi>Pliny</hi> writes, that the Indian woods are full of them, and ſo doth <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> I collect alſo out of <hi>Diodorus (lib.</hi> 3.) that the Country of the <hi>Trogloditicks,</hi> which
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:48669:188"/> is ſeated at the boſom of the Red-Sea, oppoſite to <hi>Africa,</hi> hath theſe <hi>Vri</hi> in it.</p>
                     <p>And though no Author doth affirm, that <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Paleſtine</hi> yield theſe wild Oxen, yet this doth not hinder, but that in old times, when the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> firſt inhabited thoſe Countreys, they were there; ſince it is no new thing, that the whole kind of ſome wild creatures ſhould be utterly extinct in theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys, where formerly they have abounded, of which <hi>England</hi> gives us a plain teſtimony in Wolves. <hi>Dion</hi> alſo reports the ſame of Lions, which ſometimes were bred in ſome parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> but now for many ages have not appeared there. And the ſame witneſſeth <hi>Ammianus (lib.</hi> 22.) concerning the <hi>Hippopotami</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> of which none are to be found now in that Country.</p>

That this beaſt is the <hi>Reem</hi> here ſpoken of, he proves by various teſtimonies, taken eſpecially out of the ancient <hi>Arabian, Chalde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> and <hi>Hebrew</hi> Writers, and endeavours to remove ſeveral obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions ariſing from the ſeeming incompetency of any beaſt of the <hi>Goatiſh</hi> rank or kind, to anſwer the deſcription given of that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble animal called <hi>Reem,</hi> both in the Text and in many other places of Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Thus the learned are much divided in opinion about this crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and upon which to determine is not eaſie.</p>
                  <p>Yet becauſe the word <hi>Reem</hi> is every where in Scripture ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by our Tranſlators (as alſo by many others of great autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity) <hi>Vnicorn;</hi> I ſhall leave that matter of difference to the

                  <q>Will the Vnicorn be willing to ſerve thee?</q>
                  <p>In theſe words, the Lord preſents man, as it were, inviting, wooing, hiring the Unicorn to ſerve him.

                  </p>
                  <p>It is the commendation of a ſervant, when he doth his Maſters work with his will, more than with his hand. Man ſhould be as willing to ſerve, as he is to be ſerved, as willing to obey, as to rule; nor doth any man know truly how to command, but he that knows how to obey, and when called, is willing to obey in the ſervice of God; nothing is done to him, unleſs it be done with the will, and therefore the full effect of the work of the grace of God upon the heart of man, is comprehended in this
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:48669:189"/> one word (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.3.) <hi>Thy people ſhall be willing in the day of thy power.</hi> They were once like the Unicorn in the Text, that will not ſerve; but <hi>in the day of thy power,</hi> when the word comes upon them in the power of the Spirit, they ſhall ſerve with all manner of dutiful readineſs and willingneſs. Some men are not at all wrought to the ſervice of God; others ſerve him but are not willing to ſerve, they do it <hi>by conſtraint, not willingly;</hi> for baſe fear of loſs, or for baſer hope <hi>of filthy lucre, not of a ready mind;</hi> upon which carnal terms the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> warns the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Goſpel, to take heed they <hi>feed not the flock of God</hi> (1 Epiſt. 5.2.) Nothing but a day of power conquering the will, renders us willing to ſerve Chriſt, willing to ſubmit to the yoak of Chriſt, to be bound in his furrow, and to harrow the valleys after him, that is, to do any work that he calls us to. Service ſhould be with the will, and 'tis ſo by grace. That's the firſt thing which the nature of the Unicorn is againſt, as to the ſervice of man; he hath no will to it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Note;
<q>Some beaſts have a kind of willingneſs to ſerve man.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>That ſome beaſts have ſuch a willingneſs, is more than imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, while 'tis ſaid, that ſome have not. As the wild Aſs before was ſpoken of in oppoſition to the tame, ſo here the Unicorn is ſpoken of in oppoſition to the Ox or Horſe; who though they are not properly willing to ſerve, yet they will not alwayes refuſe ſervice, but freely at laſt, or after a while, take the yoak and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the bridle. The Apoſtle ſaith (<hi>Rom.</hi> 8.20.) <hi>The creature is made ſubject to vanity, not willingly.</hi> The creatures are not willing to ſerve the luſts of men, yet many of them are willing to ſerve the occaſions and neceſſities of men. 'Tis through the ſin of man that the creature is made ſubject to vanity; but it is through the appointment of God that the creature is made ſubject to duty, and that with a kind of willingneſs.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, 'Tis ſaid here of the Unicorn, as of the wild Aſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; Canſt thou make him willing? when thou haſt uſed fair means, foul means, one way or other, will he ſerve thee? he will not.</p>
                  <pb n="360" facs="tcp:48669:190"/>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>It is hard to change nature.</q>

                        </gap>t.</note>Beaſts hold faſt their natural qualities. The Horſe, the Bullock, who are tame by nature, will come to hand; but the wild Aſs and the Unicorn, whoſe nature is quite oppoſite to ſervice, will never be broken nor brought to it: <hi>Thruſt out nature with a fork it will return again.</hi> Till nature is quite altered and changed, acts will not change. 'Tis thus with man, conſidered in nature, who as he is compared to a wild Aſſes Colt (<hi>Chap.</hi> 11.12.) ſo he may be compared to an Unicorn. Will man be willing to ſerve God? no, not by any moral perſwaſions; no, nor heartily, he may hypocritically, by any outward benefits, nor by any hard uſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. <hi>Though</hi> (as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27.22.) <hi>thou ſhouldſt bray a fool in a morter among wheat, with a peſtle, yet will not his fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs depart from him.</hi> A carnal man will never ſubmit quietly to duty, till God hath changed his nature, and made him a new man, or, till his mind is renewed after the image of God. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion is firſt a change of our nature, and then of our way. This makes converſion ſo difficult a work. Good education and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane inſtructions, may change a mans way, but nothing leſs than the power of God can change his nature. Man is naturally as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to ſerve God, as the wild beaſts are to ſerve man: He is as ſtout and as ſtiff as the Unicorn, as cruel and fierce as the Lion, as crafty as a Fox, as crooked and croſs as any creature; unleſs his heart be changed, he will never to purpoſe change his courſe. Man cannot change the courſe of the Unicorn, becauſe he cannot change his nature; and could not God change mans nature, he could never really change his courſe.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Obſerve;
<q>That any of the creatures, eſpecially ſtrong ones, are brought to hand, or to the ſervice of man, muſt be aſcribed to the power and goodneſs of God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Horſe would no more ſerve man than the Unicorn, nor would the Ox ſerve man more than the wild Aſs, unleſs the Lord had put another ſpirit or diſpoſition into them, than he hath done into the Unicorn.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Obſerve;
<q>That any of the creatures are unſerviceable to man, is to be aſcribed to the ſin of man.</q>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="361" facs="tcp:48669:190"/>
                  <p>At firſt, all creatures were ſubject to man; not only the Horſe, and the Ox, and all the now tame creatures, but the fierceſt Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Tygers, Bears, Unicorns, were all in ſubjection to man, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that ſoveraign power given man by God, in the day that God made him (<hi>Gen.</hi> 1.27, 28.) <hi>So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. And God bleſſed them, and ſaid to them, be fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and multiply, and repleniſh the earth, and ſubdue it, and have do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over the fiſhes of the ſea, and over the fowls of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.</hi> The original grand Charter of mans Soveraignty, was extended over the Unicorn and the Lion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And therefore when creatures are not willing to ſerve man, eſpecially when they riſe up againſt man, let man remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber his ſin in not obeying the Soveraign command of God. Had not man been unwilling to ſubmit to and ſerve God,<note place="margin">Quòd non omnia anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia homini ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viunt ſignum eſt &amp; po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>na peccati.</note> no creature had been unwilling to ſerve man. We may ſee our own neglect or refuſal to ſerve God, in the refuſal of any creature to ſerve us; we may ſee our own rebellion againſt God, by the rebellion of the creatures againſt us. Unleſs man had departed from God by ſin, none of the creatures had departed from their ſubjection to man. The ſin of man looſed the creatures from that bond of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to man, in which, and to which they were created.</p>
                  <q>Will the Vnicorn be willing to ſerve thee?</q>
                  <p>Obſerve, Sixthly;
<q>Thoſe Creatures which will not do ſervice unto man, but live meerly to themſelves, are wild or fierce.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe clearly reſemble the condition of thoſe men who live only to themſelves, or who ſerve none but themſelves. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſome men do they ſerve themſelves only, they reſpect no mans good, either ſpiritual or temporal, beſides their own; were it not that they had a chief reſpect to their private ends and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts in ſerving, they would never ſerve. A gracious ſpirit is willing to ſerve his neighbour, to ſerve his brother, as well as or with himſelf. Chriſt tells us, his Diſciples ſhould be ſo far from ſerving themſelves only, that they ſhould not ſerve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at all; he that will be my Diſciple (ſaith our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.24.) <hi>Let him deny himſelf,</hi> that is, not ſerve nor ſeek himſelf, either contrary to the good of others, or with a neglect of their good. Therefore they who in all they do,
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:48669:191"/> do all for themſelves, live upon no better terms, nor to any nobler ends, than the Unicorn or wild Aſs, who are not willing to ſerve any man. Let others ſink or ſwim (ſay ſuch) they care not, they will look to their own.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly and Laſtly, Though God hath made a ſort of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that (as the caſe ſtands) will not ſerve man, nor contribute any help to him; yet theſe creatures live not in vain to God, nor are they altogether unſerviceable to man, though they have no will to ſerve him. For,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, They declare the power and wiſdome of God, both in making and governing them, and in that they declare his praiſe. God would not give any creature a being, that did not one way or other, ſet forth his praiſe in the world; there's much of God ſhining in thoſe creatures, which man hath no ſervice by (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 148.) <hi>Praiſe him ye Dragons, and all Deeps.</hi> Dragons praiſe God, they raiſe up a revenue of glory to God, though man get no ſervice from them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Such creatures adorn the univerſe; the world is beautified with their variety.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Even ſuch creatures ſerve man when they are dead, though they will not while they live; ſome parts of them are Medicinal, and many uſeful to man. The Unicorn, who will ſerve no man living while he lives, yet his horn is accounted a great Antidote againſt Poyſon, and ſo is a means to prevent the death or prolong the life of many men. So then, there is no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture but is ſerviceable to God and man ſome way or other. And though it may be truly ſaid of ſome men, as of the Unicorn, with reſpect to man, <hi>they will not ſerve God,</hi> yet God hath ſervice by them. <hi>Will the Vnicorn be willing to ſerve thee?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>Or abide by thy Crib?</q>
                  <p>A Crib is that in which an Oxe or an Aſs feeds, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.3.) <hi>The Oxe knoweth his Owner, and the Aſs his Maſters Crib;</hi> that is, the veſſel in which he uſeth to be fed. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith (<hi>Prov.</hi> 14.4.) <hi>Where no Oxen are, the Crib is clean,</hi> that is, the Crib is not uſed, and ſo remains clean. If none come into a Room, the Room is clean. In one ſenſe, where Oxen are, the Crib is clean, that is, they eat up all the fodder put into it. But in <hi>Solomons</hi> ſenſe, where no Oxen are the Crib is clean, becauſe no fodder is put into it. The Lord having ſaid, the Unicorn will do no work,
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:48669:191"/> adds alſo, <hi>he will not abide by thy Crib.</hi> As he will do thee no ſervice, ſo he will put thee to no charge; that's a piece of inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity in the Unicorn, as he does no work for man, ſo he looks for no wages nor reward from man: which may be a reproof to thoſe men, who are very unwilling to ſerve others, yet are very willing to abide by their Crib; they like it well to eat and drink upon you, as long as you will, and poſſibly whether you will or no, but will not do a ſtroke of work; Such a one we call proverbially a <hi>Lurdane,</hi> from the lazy <hi>Danes,</hi> who long ſince Lording it in this Kingdom, would eat and drink in a good well-ſtored houſe, but refuſed all labour. The Unicorn is to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended above ſuch idle drones, who uſe their teeth more than their hands, as if they were born only to feed their bellies, or to live upon the ſweat of other mens brows; for he hath a kind of honeſty in him, as he doth you no work, ſo he will not trouble your Crib.</p>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>Some creatures will rather run the adventure of ſtarving, than work for their living.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>They will rather indure hunger and thirſt, than be put upon labour. There is much of this alſo in ſome mens ſpirits; 'tis ſo with all thoſe whom <hi>Solomon</hi> calls ſluggards; they prefer hunger and eaſe (which ſome calls a dogs life) before plenty with induſtry, and a thred-bare back before a ſweating brow.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, From the connexion, in that the Text ſaith, <hi>will he ſerve thee? will be abide by thy Crib?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note;
<q>Whomſoever we call to our ſervice, we ſhould provide a Crib for him.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>We ought to feed thoſe that do our work. If the Unicorn would labour, he ſhould not want a Crib, nor ſhould any labouring man want a Table; It were a moſt unrighteous thing in the ſight of God and Man if he ſhould. As the Apoſtle gives the rule (2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.10.) <hi>He that will not work, let him not eat;</hi> ſo on the contrary, he that doth work, all the reaſon in the world he ſhould eat; therefore the Apoſtle <hi>James (Chap.</hi> 5.4.) denounceth a wo againſt rich men, for detaining or keeping back, either in whole or in part, the hire of the labourers who had cut down their harveſt. Hire kept back, crieth; for what? for wrath and
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:48669:192"/> vengeance upon them that detain or keep it back. The law of God given by <hi>Moſes (Deut.</hi> 24.15.) commanded that the labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers hire ſhould be paid him preſently; his hire was not to be kept from him, no not for a night. As if the Lord had ſaid, he hath been willing to ſerve thee all the day, therefore let him carry his wages home at night, to comfort his Wife and Children. The Lord is very jealous in this thing; if a beaſt ſerve he muſt have a Crib;<note place="margin">Moratur ad praeſepe D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="366" facs="tcp:48669:193"/> 28.24.) <hi>Doth the Plow-man Plow all day to Sow? doth he open and break the clods of the ground? when he hath made plain the face thereof? doth he not caſt abroad the fitches,</hi> &amp;c? Here's a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of this work of the husbandman Plowing and Harrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or making plain the face of the ground, all in an allegory, intending a very ſpiritual work of God, in breaking and harrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the heart of man by affliction, and making it thereby fit to receive the ſeed of the Word. Thus alſo ſpake the Prophet (<hi>Hoſ.</hi> 10.11.) Judah <hi>ſhall plow, and</hi> Jacob <hi>ſhall break his clods,</hi> that is, <hi>Jacob</hi> ſhall Harrow. The Prophets meaning is, that the Lord would bring them into a labouring ſtate of life, even into captivity, where they muſt Plow, becauſe they had Plowed ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and had not Plowed up the Fallow ground of their hearts by repenting of their iniquity. <hi>Will the Vnicorn Harrow</hi>
                     <q>The Vallies after thee?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some render the word, <hi>Furrows,</hi> which lye like Valleys between the Ridges. But the word more properly ſignifieth <hi>Vallies;</hi> and they are moſt commonly Plowed and Sowed with Corn, as Hills are reſerved for Paſture. <hi>Will he Harrow the Vallies</hi>
                     <q>After thee?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>That is, will the Unicorn be led by thee? The Harrower go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth before the Horſe, or that which draweth the Harrow, and the beaſt followeth; or thus, will he Harrow the Valleys</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>After thee?</hi> That is, after thou haſt Ploughed them. As if the Lord had ſaid, will he either be driven or led? thou canſt not make him Harrow? thou canſt not lead him on in that work. Thus we have the Unicorns refuſal of thoſe labours, in which other beaſts, the Oxe and the Horſe eſpecially, are very common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſed.</p>
                  <p>Now for as much as the Husband-mans work is deſcribed, by <hi>Plowing and Harrowing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note, Firſt;
<q>We cannot get our ordinary food without much labour.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Husband-mans life, is a painful life; Plowing and Harrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing are hard labours; and what is all this for? but to bring forth the neceſſaries of mans life, bread to ſtrengthen mans heart, and
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:48669:193"/> by conſequence what ever elſe is food for man. <hi>Adam</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>to dreſs the Garden, and to keep it, (Gen.</hi> 2.15.) <hi>Adam</hi> was not put into that pleaſant Garden, only to take his pleaſure and to eat the fruit of it; but he was put into the Garden to dreſs it, and to keep it. Even <hi>Adam</hi> was to eat upon his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, though not ſuch labour as man now eateth upon; that came in by ſin after the fall; labour was impoſed upon man, not only as a duty, but as a penalty. It was impoſed upon man before the fall as a duty, but it was impoſed upon man after the fall as a penalty, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 3.17, 18, 19.) <hi>Curſed is the ground for thy ſake; in ſorrow ſhalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life. In the ſweat of thy face ſhalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground.</hi> Our ordinary bread is not eaſily come by; remember the Husband-mans labour. Hence the Apoſtle, when he would ſhew what pains God taketh, either immediately by the work of his Spirit, or mediately by the labour of his Miniſters, to convert and build up ſouls in the faith, he tells us (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.9.) That <hi>we are Gods husbandry, and Gods building.</hi> As if he had ſaid, great pains hath been or muſt be beſtowed upon you, that your ſouls may be ſaved, and that ye may bring forth fruits of righteouſneſs unto eternal life. The Lord hath his ſpiritual Plow-men, his Labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, his Oxen; by theſe the faithful and induſtrious Miniſters of the Goſpel are emblem'd, and ſet forth in the holy Scriptures, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.10. <hi>Rev.</hi> 4.7.)</p>
                  <p>Note, Secondly;
<q>There is no Sowing without Plowing.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>You muſt ſtir up and break the ground, before you caſt the ſeed into it; 'tis not elſe fit to receive the ſeed, and improve it for a harveſt. The Scripture ſpeaks firſt of Plowing, then of Sowing (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.24, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) The Plow-man opens the earth, and breaks the clods before he caſts in his ſeed, the cumin, the fitches, and the principal wheat. He doth not Plow for Plowing ſake, but for Sowing; and when he hath Plowed he leaveth not his work, till he hath Sowed what he Plowed. This method doth the Lord uſe in his ſpiritual husbandry; the Plow of repentance muſt break up the Fallow ground of the heart, and the Harrow muſt ſmooth the face of the ſoul, before it be fit to bring forth. The Spirit makes frequent uſe of theſe Metaphors (<hi>Jer.</hi> 4.6.)
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:48669:194"/> 
                     <hi>Plow up the Fallow ground of your hearts;</hi> read alſo (<hi>Hoſea</hi> 10.12.)</p>
                  <p>Further, Harrowing comes after Plowing, and either before or immediatly after ſowing (there is ſome variety as to hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry in this point) that the ſeed ſown may be preſerved from being devoured by the Fowls of the air, it muſt (unleſs ſowed under Furrows) be Harrowed. Harrowing helps the ſeed to ſpring more freely, and grow more thrivingly. And thus it is alſo in ſpiritual husbandry; <hi>When the ſeed of the Word is Sown, the heart muſt be Harrowed,</hi> elſe the Seed will miſcarry. In that Parable of the Sower (<hi>Mat.</hi> 13.) ſome ſeed fell upon the high-way, which was neither Plowed nor Harrowed. This High-way ground, ſignifieth thoſe careleſs hearers who receive the Word in a formality only; the Fowls of the air (evil ſpirits) quickly picked up that, becauſe it was not covered by Harrowing. Now there are two Harrows, by which the Seed of the Word caſt into the Vallies and Furrows of our Hearts, is covered and ſecured, that it may bring forth fruit to perfection; theſe are meditation and prayer. By meditation we hide the word in our hearts, and by prayer we obtain a bleſſing upon it from God, both for the ſecuring of it, and our fruit-bearing according to it. There are two reſemblances in Scripture, ſetting forth the uſe of meditation and prayer about the word received; The one, is <hi>chewing of the cud;</hi> the other, is <hi>Harrowing.</hi> Clean beaſts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law chewed the cud; and wiſe men, both under Law and Goſpel, Harrow their land; a godly man doth both in a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual way, while he meditates in the Word, and prays for a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing upon it. Thus husbandry for our daily bread, teacheth us what courſe the Lord expects we ſhould take for our ſouls, that we may bring forth fruit, and anſwer the end of receiving his Word. The Unicorn will not be brought to either of theſe parts of the Husband-mans labour, and his refuſal is aggravated in the next <hi>Verſe,</hi> by the ability which he hath for both.</p>

                     <q>Becauſe his ſtrength is great?</q> The ſtrength or force of his body is great, very great, but the force or ſtubbornneſs of his will, that is, his wilfulneſs is far greater,<note place="margin">

We find ſtrength often attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Unicorn in Scripture (<hi>Numb.</hi> 23.22.) <hi>He,</hi> (that is, God, or <hi>Iſrael,</hi> through the preſence of God with him, as was ſhewed before) <hi>hath as it were the ſtrength of an Vnicorn.</hi> 'Tis not ſaid, he hath as it were the ſtrength of an Horſe, or of an Ox, which are very ſtrong creatures, but of an <hi>Vnicorn;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by implying, that the Unicorn is a creature of ſuch great ſtrength, that he knew not where to find a ſtronger. The Unicorn hath ſtrength enough for his work, but he hath no mind to his work; and therefore <hi>wilt thou truſt him becauſe his ſtrength is great?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note, Firſt;
<q>Great ſtrength is required for great work.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are ſome works that are done, not ſo much by ſtrength as by art, or as it were, by ſlight of hand; ſuch a work a feeble weak man may do: but there are other works which require great ſtrength; all the wit, and skill, and learning, &amp; cunning of men, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do them, unleſs they have a ſutable, that is, a great portion of ſtrength for the doing of them. <hi>David (Pſal.</hi> 144.14.) deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing the temporal felicity of his people, makes this requeſt for them, <hi>That our Oxen be ſtrong to labour.</hi> The labour of the Ox is great, and therefore he needs great ſtrength to do his work, and go through with his labour.</p>
                  <p>Note, Secondly;
<q>They who have great ſtrength, may do great works.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Great ſtrength is a great advantage for ſervice. If the Unicorn
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:48669:195"/> would imploy and put out his ſtrength, he might do much. Strength of body is a talent, much may be done by that; ſtrength of mind is an excellent talent, much more, very much more may be done by that. But when a man hath much ſtrength of body and mind together, what may not he do! Let thoſe who have much ſtrength, conſider how they uſe it. For a man to have the ſtrength of an Unicorn, much bodily ſtrength, and make no uſe of it, is to become more beaſtly than the Unicorn. <hi>A ſtrong man rejoyceth to run a race (Pſal.</hi> 19.5.) He that hath great ſtrength, may run a great race. A race requireth great ſtrength, and he that hath ſtrength, or is a ſtrong man, ſhould rejoyce to run it. A ſtrong man, if he have an heart and a will to his work, delighteth in his work more than in his reward.</p>
                  <p>Note, Thirdly;
<q>Some have ſtrength enough to do much work, to do great and good things, yet are not at all to be truſted with the doing of any thing that is great or good.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Strength is not alwayes to be truſted. There is a twofold truſt in ſtrength; Firſt, There is a truſt in ſtrength as to confidence in it for ſucceſs; and thus we are not to truſt any ſtrength in the world, neither our own nor others. <hi>Curſed is the man that truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in man, and maketh fleſh his arm (Jer.</hi> 17.5.) The arm of fleſh is too weak to be truſted in, though never ſo ſtrong; though it have the ſtrength of the Unicorn, it muſt not be truſted; no creatures ſtrength is to be truſted in, as to dependance upon it. Secondly, There is a truſting of ſtrength as to the uſing and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying of it; thus ſtrength may be truſted. We may truſt the ſtrong that they will uſe their ſtrength for us, only we muſt not reſt in their ſtrength. They who (like the Unicorn in the Text) have great ſtrength, and yet are not to be truſted that they will uſe it, are in a much worſe condition than they who have no ſtrength to uſe, or to make them any way uſeful. There are three ſorts of men to be conſidered, in reſpect of ſtrength.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Some have a will to do more than they have ſtrength to do; they have a will to do more in ordinary work, than they have ſtrength to do, and they have a will to do more in extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary work &amp; duty, than they have ſtrength and ability to do. The Apoſtle ſpeaking of the labour of love or charity, in the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the good things of this life, to thoſe that ſtand in
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:48669:195"/> need, thus commendeth the <hi>Macedonians</hi> (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.5.) <hi>For to their power, I bear them record, and beyond their power, they were willing, &amp;c.</hi> He meaneth, not the power of their bodies, but of their purſes and eſtates. Some are willing beyond the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of their eſtates, to relieve the neceſſities of others; and ſome are willing beyond the power of their bodies, to labour not only for the ſupply of their own neceſſities, but in any publick ſervice. To have a will to labour according to our ſtrength for labour, ſheweth an honeſt heart; but to have a will to labour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond our ſtrength for labour, ſheweth an Heroick heart. But</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Moſt have ſtrength to do more than they have a will to do; they are like the Unicorn, and that upon a double ground: Firſt, Some are ſo lazy and idle, that they will not do what they have ſtrength to do. Thus <hi>Solomon</hi> deſcribeth the ſluggard (<hi>Prov.</hi> 21.5.) <hi>His hands refuſe to labour.</hi> He hath ſtrength enough in his hand, but for idleneſs he will do nothing. Secondly, Others are ſo proud, that though they have ſtrength enough to labour, yet they will not; they are ſo ſtout, ſo ſtubborn, ſo high-minded, that they ſco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n to work or do ſervice; they think themſelves too good to take pains: I ſhall ſay too little, if I ſay, theſe are in a very bad frame. They are right Unicorns, who are ſo ſtout that they will not ſerve, nor be bound to attend any ſervice.</p>
                  <p>There is a third ſort, who have ſtrength to do ſervice, and they have alſo will to do it; they have will, and they have ſtrength, but they want an opportunity to do ſervice. This may be the caſe of a good man, who is like the labouring Ox; A good man hath alwayes a will to work, and may have ſtrength for his work too, yet many times wants work. As they in the Parable (<hi>Mat.</hi> 20.6, 7.) anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when queſtioned, <hi>Why ſtand ye all the day idle?</hi> It was not (ſo they excuſed themſelves) becauſe they had no will to work, or had no ſtrength to work; but (ſay they) <hi>No man hath hired us;</hi> we have not been called to work, we know not where to have a dayes work. Such there are, who have will and ſtrength, while they want a call. Thus the Apoſtle ſpake concerning the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians</hi> (Chap. 4.10.) <hi>Ye were careful, but ye lacked opportunity.</hi> The dore was not open, and ſo ye could not do what ye deſired, and had both a mind and an ability to do. The point in hand leadeth us to the middle ſort of perſons (truly ſhaddowed by the Unicorn) who though they have much ſtrength to do ſervice,
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:48669:196"/> yet they have no mind to ſerve, but hide their Talent in a Nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin, and put their Candle under a Buſhel: Theſe are not to be truſted, though they are well furniſhed. I may ſay to any man concerning ſuch men, as the Lord to <hi>Job,</hi> concerning the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corn; <hi>Wilt thou truſt them, becauſe their ſtrength is great?</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their ſtrength of mind, their ſtrength of body, their ſtrength of eſtate is great? Can we truſt all rich men that they will do works of charity, becauſe their eſtate is great? Can we truſt all healthy men, who have ſound and able limbes, that they will take pains, becauſe their bodily ſtrength is great? Can we truſt all knowing men, who have quick parts, and excellent gifts, much knowledge, that they will go through with their work, becauſe the ſtrength of their minds is great? We can hardly find any to truſt, what ſtrength ſoever they have, but thoſe who have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſtrength of grace from God, and ſo have ſtrength of faith in God, ſtrength of love, ſtrength of affections to God, ſtrength of zeal for God. And even they who have ſtrength of grace, may fail their truſt very much (<hi>Job</hi> 4.18.) <hi>Behold he put no truſt in his Servants, and his Angels he charged with folly.</hi> The Lord could not be confident of Angels, who are mighty, in ſtrength. If God ſhould leave Angels to themſelves, they would ſoon fail; it is becauſe Angels are confirmed by grace (Chriſt being the head of Angels) that they ſtand faſt to their work, and abide by their duty, elſe the Lord could not truſt Angels with all their created ſtrength; much leſs then could the Lord truſt the beſt of Saints with all the ſpiritual ſtrength he hath planted in them, did he not continually confirm them, and quicken them (to the work which he hath called them to) by his holy Spirit. No further than any man truſteth in Chriſt for ſtrength, or maketh Chriſt his ſtrength as well as his righteouſneſs, is he to be truſted with the doing of any work, any more than the Unicorn, how much ſoever his ſtrength is? Many are ſet a work, and do work, becauſe their ſtrength is great, but none (in a due ſenſe) can be truſted, but they who make Chriſt their ſtrength, and look daily to him for it. <hi>Wilt thou truſt him, becauſe his ſtrength is great?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>Or wilt thou leave thy labour to h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>This latter part of the <hi>Verſe</hi> is of the ſame importance with the former, yet I ſhall touch a little upon it. <hi>Wilt thou leave

                  <p>Firſt, For the very act of labour. <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid (<hi>Gen.</hi> 31.42.) <hi>God hath ſeen mine affliction, and the labour of my hands.</hi> God knows (ſaid he to <hi>Laban</hi>) what pains I have taken, what hard work I have been at in thy ſervice; and how hard he had been at work, he told <hi>Laban</hi> (ver. 40.) <hi>Thus I was in the day, the drought conſumed me; and the froſt by night, and my ſleep depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from me.</hi> To ſuch hard work in ſpirituals the Apoſtle exhorts; <hi>Be ſtedfaſt; and unmoveable,</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, Labour is taken ſometimes for the fruit of labour, or for that which is got by labour; the reward, and wages given and received for work and ſervice done, is called labour (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 128.2.) <hi>Thou ſhalt eat the labour of thy hands.</hi> No man can eat the acts of his labour, but every man ſhould eat the fruit of his labour; labour brings in bread, and that bread is ſweeteſt which comes in by labour.

                  <p>Note hence, Firſt;
<q>It is not Wiſdom to leave our work to ſuch as we cannot truſt.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our work will be ill done, or half done, or not done at all by thoſe that we cannot truſt. We truſt thoſe much, to whom we leave our buſineſs; and there are three things requiſite in thoſe to whom we leave it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That they have ſtrength and ability for it; there is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of that: No wiſe man will truſt or leave his buſineſs with him that hath no ſtrength to do it, no ability for it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That they be ſubject and obedient to us. No wiſe man will leave his buſineſs in the hand of thoſe who acknowledge no obedience nor ſubjection to him, how much ſtrength ſoever they have. An unſubmitting ſtrength will work againſt us rather than for us.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That they be faithful. No man will leave his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to a perſon of ſtrength and in ſubjection to him, if he be not honeſt to him. <hi>Solomon</hi> hath ſufficien<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And as it is thus among men, they will not leave their buſineſs with an Unicorn, with one that hath ſtrength, but yeilds no ſubjection, nor ever ſhewed any faithfulneſs; ſo God will not leave his labour, his work and ſervice to ſuch as are like the Unicorn; he will not leave it in ſuch hands, as have great ability to carry it through, yet want obedience to his will, and faithfulneſs in his work. There muſt be a concurrence of theſe three, ſtrength, ſubjection, and faithfulneſs, in all thoſe to whom the Lord God, the God only wiſe, will leave his labour, or commit the doing of any ſervice for him. But where theſe three meet and center in any
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:48669:198"/> perſon, ſtrength of body and mind, ſubmiſſion of will, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to a work; how great things may they do in the ſervice whether of God or Man?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Obſerve;
<q>A will, a mind to work, or a w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>As the Unicorn with his great ſtrength, ſo they who are like the Unicorn in ſtrength may do little or nothing. But they that have only a little ſtrength, and a mind to be doing, have done, and may do much. Little ſtrength is a kind of weakneſs, yet where there is a willing mind, weakneſs will do more than great ſtrength without a willing mind. We have a common ſaying; <hi>John is a good ſervant when Will is at home.</hi> Willingneſs to work, works better than bare ſtrength: We have this concluſion (<hi>Neh.</hi> 4.6.) <hi>So built we the wall (Nehemiah</hi> ſpake there of the Jews return'd from <hi>Babylon) And all the wall was joyned together unto the half thereof.

Will they work miracles? remove moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains? But how feeble ſoever they were, the work went on amain, <hi>For the people had a mind, a heart to work.</hi> Though they were no Unicorns, no people of great ſtrength; though they were feeble Jews, yet they attained to half their work quickly: <hi>Strong hearts and feeble hands, will diſpatch a buſineſs better and ſooner, than ſtrong hands and feeble hearts.</hi> 'Tis thus, as in corporal ſo in ſpiritual labour, where there is a mind to the work, though we have but a little ſtrength, we ſhall do great things. This was the high commendation of the Church of <hi>Philadelphia (Rev.</hi> 3.8.) <hi>Thou haſt a little ſtrength and haſt kept my word, and haſt not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied my name.

                     </note>Seed may be taken two wayes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, For that which is to be ſowed; it is ordinary with the Husband-man, to call that <hi>ſeed-corn</hi> which he reſerveth for ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The grain or corn intended to be ſowed on the earth, is properly <hi>ſeed-corn;</hi> in alluſion whereunto the Pſalmiſt ſaith (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 126.6.) <hi>He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious ſeed, ſhall doubtleſs come again with rejoycing, bringing his ſheaves with him.</hi> The people of God mourning and praying, ſow precious ſeed. Believing prayers and repenting tears never failed, nor ſhall ever fail, of a merciful, of a plentiful Harveſt, or of a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Harveſt of mercy. Some underſtand this Text thus; <hi>Wilt thou believe that he will return thy ſeed?</hi> will he do this ſervice for thee? will he carry thy ſeed, which is to be ſown, into the field? But though that be a piece of ſervice to carry the ſeed-corn into the field, yet the ſcope of the place doth not well com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with it here; and therefore leaving that interpretation, I ſhall rather</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Take ſeed for ripe corn, or for that which is reap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; as in <hi>Haggai</hi> (Chap. 2.19.) <hi>Is the ſeed yet in the Barn?</hi> That is, is the Harveſt yet come in? No, the ſeed is not in the
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:48669:199"/> Barn. So, in this place, <hi>ſeed</hi> is that which hath been ſown and grown up, and ready to be gathered into the Barn. And that may be taken two wayes;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Thus:<note place="margin">Num credes ei, quod dum hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum tuam ei arandam com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittis, ita aptè eam arare poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit ut tandem reddat tuam ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentem, vel ut ex ejus labore proveniat &amp; creſcat ſeges ut tandem de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metatur &amp; in aream deporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur ad trituran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum. <hi>Merc.</hi> Sperandum non eſt ut ager à Monocerote ſubactus ſemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem acceptam cum uſura red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dat. <hi>Sanct.</hi>
                     </note> Will the Unicorn by plowing and harrowing the ground, procure that thy ſeed ſhall return again to thee? or that the ſeed which is ſown, ſhall come home to thy Barn, yielding a good crop, ſo returning what was ſowed with advantage and increaſe? <hi>Wilt thou believe him that he will cauſe thy ſeed thus to return home to thee?</hi> Surely no; do not believe that he will do thee any ſuch ſervice, for he will deceive thy credulity if thou doſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Thus: Wilt thou believe that he will draw the cart, and ſo help thee home with thy corn at Harveſt? This Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is moſt favoured, not only by our Tranſlation, but by the words following in the latter part of the verſe, both which intimate, that the ſeed here ſpoken of, is the ſeed reaped, rather than that to be ſowed. <hi>Will he bring home thy ſeed,</hi>
                     <q>And gather it into thy barn?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Seed to be ſowed, is carried into the field, not into the barn; ſeed or corn reaped, is carried into the barn, not into the field. As if it had been ſaid, The Unicorn will do thee no ſervice: As he would not go to plow, ſo neither will he go to cart, for the gathering of thy ſeed into thy barn. Sowing, reaping, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering into the barn, are the three principal parts of the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band-mans labour; and therefore our Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſhewing how the fowls of the air live purely upon the providence of God without labour, ſaith (<hi>Mat.</hi> 6.26.) <hi>They ſow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns, yet your heavenly father feedeth them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The word which we tranſlate <hi>Barn,</hi> is uſed (<hi>Numb.</hi> 18.27. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.6.) and in both places it is rendred, <hi>Threſhing-floor.</hi> The threſhing-floor is uſually in the barn, and therefore the ſame word may well ſignifie both. <hi>Wilt thou believe him that he will bring home thy ſeed, and gather it into thy barn?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note, Firſt;
<q>The labour of beaſts is very profitable to man.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Ox and Horſe bring the ſeed home formally when 'tis
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:48669:200"/> reaped, and they bring it home or make it to return vertually when they labour and take pains about or for the ſowing of it. The Pſalmiſt having prayed (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 144. <hi>verſ.</hi> 13.) <hi>That our gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners may be full, affording all manner of ſtore,</hi> preſently adds (<hi>verſ.</hi> 14.) <hi>That our Oxen may be ſtrong to labour; for (Prov.</hi> 14.4.) <hi>where no Oxen are, the crib is clean.</hi> Not only, Firſt, Becauſe there is no need to fill the crib, where no oxen are to eat up the fodder, as was ſhewed a little before: But, Secondly, Becauſe where no Oxen are, there is nothing to fill it. The crib muſt needs be empty, when the barn is empty; food faileth both for man and beaſt, where there are no Oxen. Barns and garners are full, when the Ox is ſtrong to labour, or becauſe the ſtrong Ox hath been in labour: For (as it followeth) <hi>Much increaſe cometh by the ſtrength of the Ox.</hi> Why doth <hi>Solomon</hi> impute increaſe to the ſtrength of the Ox? Surely, becauſe the Ox being ſtrong is alſo willing to labour and lay out his ſtrength, and ſo, much increaſe cometh by the ſtrength and labour of the Ox, though that alone will not do it. For that there may be an increaſe, theſe five things muſt concur.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The skill and induſtry of the Husband-man.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The ſtrength and labour of the Ox or Horſe.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The vertue and fatneſs of the earth.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The ſhowers and influences of heaven.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, And above all, the bleſſing of God. Old <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſaid of his Son <hi>Jacob (Gen.</hi> 27.27.) <hi>See, the ſmell of my Son is as the ſmell of a field, which the Lord hath bleſſed.</hi> As there is no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe without the bleſſing of God, how much ſoever men or oxen labour, ſo there is great increaſe (the Lord adding his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing) by the labour of men and oxen. Labour and increaſe uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly go together; and where no labour is, there (except by mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle) is no increaſe: Where no labour is, the barn is empty, the crib is empty, the belly is empty, the purſe is empty. <hi>Of doing nothing comes nothing, but want and miſery.</hi> 'Tis ſaid, when the Ox is wearieſt, he treads ſureſt: To be ſure, they who are moſt wearied by honeſt pains-taking, tread ſureſt upon honeſt profit.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, obſerve;
<q>Seed ſown is not loſt, but returns and comes home again.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>That which was ſcattered abroad in the field, is gathered into
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:48669:200"/> the barn. Some may think when they ſee the Husbandman caſt his ſeed into the ground, that he caſts it away; but by the labour of the Ox, by the skill of the Husbandman, and the bleſſing of God upon all, the ſeed cometh home again. Thus the Apoſtle ſpake in a ſpiritual ſenſe; <hi>He that ploweth, ſhould plow in hope; and he that threſheth in hope, ſhould be partaker of his hope</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.10.) It ſhould be ſo according to the ordination of God, as to the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Miniſters of God (of whoſe labour in plowing up ſouls by the word, and ſowing thoſe ſouls with the word, the Apoſtle there treats) And it is ſo through the benediction of God, as to labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Husband-men and their cattel, in plowing and ſowing the ſoyl of the earth. Yea, thus it is in all we do, our actions (good or bad) are as ſeed ſown, which will certainly come again, they will not be loſt. Good done, will aſſuredly turn to good; and evil done (and not undone by repentance) will as ſurely turn to evil. The Apoſtle gives us this double aſſurance (<hi>Gal.</hi> 6.7, 8.) <hi>Whatſoever a man ſoweth, that</hi> (not numerically, but ſpecifically) <hi>ſhall he alſo reap:</hi> For, <hi>He that ſoweth to his fleſh, ſhall of the fleſh reap corruption; but he that ſoweth to the ſpirit, ſhall of the ſpirit reap life everlaſting.</hi> And thus in ſpecial, works of charity, or our diſtributions to the neceſſities of others, are more ſignificantly called ſowing (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 112.9.) <hi>He hath diſperſed, he hath given to the poor</hi> (That is, he hath ſowed his alms abundantly; what then? It followeth) <hi>His righteouſneſs endureth for ever, his horn ſhall be exalted with honor.</hi> To give to the poor, eſpecially to Gods poor, to the godly poor, or to thoſe that are made poor for Gods ſake, is ſowing good ſeed; and he that ſoweth thus, ſhall receive a fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful crop. <hi>Grain ſowed in the field, may yield a good increaſe; but that which is rightly ſowed in the bowels of the poor, ſhall certainly yield a better.</hi> What we give, is like ſeed ſowed in the field, which increaſeth thirty, ſixty, an hundred fold: What we keep by us, is like corn ſtored up in the garner, which we bring forth and ſpend, and there's an end of it. Here's great encouragement to do good, yea to abound in doing good to others. What we ſo part with, is not loſt, but ſowed; it will come back to the barn, it will come home again, and that with a great increaſe. And doubtleſs where there hath been a plowing up of the heart by a work of grace, there will be a free ſowing in every good work. And though we are not to do good works, meerly eying a return,
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:48669:201"/> or our perſonal advantage, yet we may have an eye to it, as <hi>Moſes</hi> had in his holy ſufferings and ſervices, <hi>to the recompence of reward:</hi> yea, and take incouragement from the Lords bounty, to be more in duty, more in charity, even unto bounty. We may conſider the harveſt while we are diligent in ſowing, yea, to make us more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in ſowing.</p>
                  <p>Having thus opened the ſeveral properties of this creature, here called the <hi>Vnicorn,</hi> properly taken, and given out ſome me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations upon them, it will not be (I conceive) either unuſeful or unacceptable to the Reader, if for the concluſion of the whole matter in hand, I ſhew how the holy Scriptures, together with ſome of the Ancients, make uſe of this creature, tropically, or in a figure, to reſemble and repreſent,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The ſtate of the Church and people of God. Thus <hi>Moſes</hi> reports <hi>Balaam</hi> ſhadowing the power and bleſſedneſs of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when he came and was hired to curſe them (<hi>Numb.</hi> 23.22.) <hi>God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>brought them</hi> (that is, the children of <hi>Iſrael) out of Egypt; he hath, as it were, the ſtrength of an Vnicorn.</hi> Moſt expound the word, <hi>He,</hi> collectively, concerning that whole peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as one body; <hi>He,</hi> that is, <hi>Iſrael, hath as it were, the ſtrength of an Vnicorn;</hi> that is, he is exceeding ſtrong. Some expound it of God: <hi>He,</hi> that is, God, who brought them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> the mighty God of <hi>Jacob,</hi> hath as it were, the ſtrength of an Unicorn. God is indeed infinitely ſtrong, ſtronger than the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corn. That which is moſt eminent in any creature, or for which any creature is moſt eminent, the Scripture often aſcribes in a way of ſuper-eminency unto God. The Lord hath ſtrength like the ſtrongeſt; and how ſtrong ſoever he is, he is ſtrong for his <hi>Iſrael,</hi> yea, he is the ſtrength of his <hi>Iſrael.</hi> So that if we take the word in this latter ſenſe, it reaches the ſame thing, ſetting forth the power and ſtrength of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> by the ſtrength of the Unicorn; for the Lord, who is their ſtrength, will make them ſtrong like Unicorns. <hi>Balaam</hi> ſpake thus again (<hi>Numb.</hi> 24.8.) <hi>God brought him</hi> (all <hi>Iſrael</hi> as one man) <hi>out of Egypt; he hath as it were, the ſtrength of an Vnicorn, he ſhall eat up the Nations his enemies, and ſhall break their bones, and pierce them through with his arrows.</hi> Thus alſo <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpake or prophecyed of the Tribe of <hi>Joſeph (Deut.</hi> 33.17.) <hi>His glory is like the firſtling of his Bullock, and his horns are like the horns of Vnicorns, with them ſhall he puſh the
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:48669:201"/> people</hi> (or peoples, the word is plural) <hi>together, to the ends of the earth, and they are the ten thouſands of</hi> Ephraim, <hi>and they are the thouſands of</hi> Manaſſeh. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſets out the fruitfulneſs of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> beyond that of <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> ten for one; and in both, joyntly ſhews how powerful, how prevailing they ſhall be; even, as if they puſht their enemies with horns like thoſe of Unicorns. In all theſe Scriptures, the Lord fore-ſhewed the wonderful force of the Jewiſh Church of old, his portion and peculiar people, by that of the Unicorn. <hi>David</hi> alſo (as was ſaid before) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth his aſſurance of a proſperous condition and great ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, in the ſame language (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 92.10.) <hi>He ſhall exalt my horn, like the horn of an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nicorn.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And we may affirm the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God are like the Unicorn, chiefly upon this account; becauſe their ſtrength and defence, or their ſtrong defence is in, and by their horn. And if any ask, what or who is that? I anſwer, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> Of whom, <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charias</hi> filled with the Holy Ghoſt, propheſied, ſaying (<hi>Luke</hi> 1.59.) <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord God of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>for he hath viſited and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed his people, and hath raiſed up an horn of ſalvation for us, in the houſe of his ſervant</hi> David.

                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe he is the Strength and Defence of his people.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Becauſe he is the Glory and Honour of his people. Thus the <hi>Seventy</hi> tranſlate that (<hi>Num.</hi> 23.22.) he hath (as it were) <hi>the glory of an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nicorn.</hi> As <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is called a light to lighten the Gentiles,</hi> ſo <hi>the glory of his people Iſrael (Luke</hi> 2.32.)</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Jeſus Chriſt is <hi>an horn of ſalvation</hi> to his people, as he is (like the horn of an Unicorn, according to report, againſt bodily poyſon) the moſt Soveraign, yea, the only antidote againſt the poiſon of ſin, and the infection of the world (2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4.) <hi>By him we eſcape the corruption that is in the world, through luſt,</hi> that is, believing in him, we are preſerved from thoſe poiſonous luſts, which corrupt and infect this world.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Some of the Ancients and Moderns too, make the Unicorns ſtoutneſs and ſtiffneſs of ſpirit againſt doing any work for man; an embleme of that gracious well-temper'd ſtoutneſs &amp; reſolvedneſs of ſpirit in the faithful ſervants of God, againſt doing any work at all for the Devil, as alſo in refuſing to
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:48669:202"/> do any ſinful work at the will or command of man: In which ſenſe, it is both their wiſdom and their duty not to ſerve nor pleaſe men (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.23. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.10.) Thus <hi>Shadrach, Meſhach,</hi> and <hi>Abednego</hi> anſwered <hi>Nebuchadnezar (Dan.</hi> 3.18.) <hi>We will not ſerve thy gods.</hi> Theſe were no willful men, though they ſaid, <hi>We will not:</hi> Their underſtanding was in the anſwer as well as their will, and their conſcience for God, as well as either. And in this ſenſe the Apoſtle, who ſo often exhorts to faithfulneſs and diligence in the ſervice of man, admoniſheth us, <hi>Not to be the ſervants of men,</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.23.) And in this ſenſe, (though he had ſaid, <hi>I pleaſe all men, in all things for their profit, that they might be ſaved</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.33.) and counſelleth every man, <hi>to pleaſe his neighbour for his good to edification (Rom.</hi> 15.2.) yet) concludeth of himſelf, <hi>If I yet pleaſed men, I ſhould not be the ſervant of Chriſt (Gal.</hi> 1.10.)</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Unicorn is ſpoken of in Scripture, as an Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyphick of thoſe evil men, who are enemies to the Church of God (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 34.7.) <hi>And the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nicorns</hi> (we put in the Margin the <hi>Rhinoceros</hi>) 'tis this <hi>Hebrew</hi> word) <hi>ſhall come down with them, and the Bullocks with the Bulls,</hi> &amp;c. How ſhall the Unicorns <hi>come down with them?</hi> Not as we come down from a hill, or high place upon our feet, but they being deſtroyed ſhall be caſt or thrown down. Theſe Unicorns in the Prophet, are all thoſe proud and mighty men of the world, who oppoſe, oppreſs, and perſecute the Church of God, called out of the world to faith in Chriſt, and ſalvation by him, as appears fully (<hi>ver.</hi> 8.) Theſe for their ſtubbornneſs againſt the will and ways of God, are juſtly compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to, or called Unicorns; For, as Unicorns will not ſerve men, ſo theſe will not ſerve God; they will neither Plow nor Harrow, they will neither go nor come at his command.</p>
                  <p>And as the enemies of the Church, ſo, the enemies of Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, or they who perſecuted, purſued, and afflicted him to death, are ſet forth under this title, in that prayer of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> a type of Chriſt (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.21.) <hi>Save me from the Lions mouth, for thou haſt heard me from the horns of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nicorns.</hi> Chriſt prayed, <hi>Save me from the Lions mouth,</hi> that is, from my greateſt enemies: <hi>Thou haſt heard me from the horns of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corns,</hi> that is, of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> of <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> againſt whom Chriſt had help when he prayed, and got
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:48669:202"/> victory over them all, by his death and ſufferings.<note place="margin">In arcano ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mone Monoce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ros ferus, jugi impatiens in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domituſque peccator eſt. <hi>Franc. Joan. in paraph. libri</hi> Job.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, The Unicorn (according to the deſcription here given of him) reſembles all refractory and rebellious ſinners, who will by no means be reclaimed to the ſervice of God, who will not receive the yoke of Chriſt though eaſie, nor bear his burden though light, but remaining obſtinate and obdurate in their ſins, will only do what they will, ſerving divers luſts and pleaſures, and being to every good work reprobate. And as Naturaliſts ſay of the Unicorn, he may be ſlain, he will not be taken;<note place="margin">Interemi poteſt, capi non poteſt. <hi>Plin.</hi>
                     </note> ſo we may ſay of ſuch men, they will ſooner looſe their lives than their wills: They are like <hi>natural bruit beaſts</hi> (of whom the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.12.) <hi>made to be taken and deſtroyed.</hi> Such beaſts were the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> of whom it is ſaid (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.10.) <hi>Thou haſt broken</hi> Rahab <hi>in pieces, as one that is ſlain.</hi> Some beaſts are broken and tamed, but <hi>Egypt</hi> (called <hi>Rahab</hi> for ſtrength and pride, or for pride in ſtrength) was a beaſt that would not be broken and tamed by all thoſe plagues of God poured upon it at Land, and was therefore broken and ſlain in the Red-ſea.</p>
                  <p>Thus we ſee how the Church and faithful people of God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the Unicorn in ſome things; as alſo, how the wicked of the world, or the world lying in wickedneſs, reſemble him in other things.</p>

                  <p>THe Lord having put ſeveral queſtions to <hi>Job,</hi> about the wild beaſts of the earth, queſtions him in this context, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our tranſlation, about two, but according to ſome other tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlations and readings, about three ſorts of Fowls of the Aire. Our tranſlation mentions only the Peacock and Oſtrich, others adde the Stork.</p>

                     </note>Yet 'tis the opinion of a very late and learned Author, that the whole context of theſe ſix verſes contains the deſcription of one Fowl only, and that the Oſtrich. It cannot be denied, but that the firſt <hi>verſe</hi> of this context, or the 13th of the <hi>Chapter,</hi> hath as various tranſlations, by all ſorts of Authors, as any (if not more than any) in this book; yet he grants, that moſt who have tranſlated it into Latine, and all that ever he ſaw, who have tranſlated it into the Mother language, of any Country, render it, the <hi>Peacock.</hi> And therefore referring the Reader to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſal of his reaſons and authorities, which are many and cogent, why he interprets the word <hi>Renamim,</hi> the <hi>Oſtrich,</hi> I ſhall only touch at ſome of them in paſſage, as I proceed to open the Text, as 'tis expreſſed in our own tranſlation.</p>

                     <pb n="385" facs="tcp:48669:203"/>Gaveſt thou the goodly wings unto the Peacocks?</q>
                  <p>That the Hebrew word here uſed, ſignifies a Peacock, is clear in all thoſe Lexicographers that I have met with. Another word is uſed (1 <hi>Kings</hi> 10.22.) which yet <hi>Buxtorfius</hi> ſaith is by ſome rendred <hi>Parrats,</hi> and they are often brought in ſhips from far Countries. This I deſire the Reader to take notice of, that there is a wonderful variety and difference of opinion among In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters, about the proper names of Animals, Plants and Gemms; and therefore no wonder if ſome render the word <hi>Chaſidah</hi> in the following part of this <hi>verſe,</hi> which is uſually taken for a <hi>Storke,</hi> the <hi>Oſtrich;</hi> and others, the word <hi>Renanim</hi> at the beginning of it, <hi>Oſtriches,</hi> which we and almoſt all others, render <hi>Peacocks.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Peacock is deſcribed only by his wings in the former part of the 13th <hi>verſe, Gaveſt thou the goodly wings unto the Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cock.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Oſtrich is deſcribed, not only by her wings and feathers, in the ſame 13th <hi>verſe,</hi> but by four diſtinct qualities, in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of the five <hi>verſes</hi> following;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, By her careleſneſs and forgetfulneſs of that which ſhe ſhould be very tender of, her eggs, when ſhe hath laid them; this we have in the 14th and 15th <hi>verſes; Which leaveth her eggs in the earth, and warmeth them in the duſt, and forgetteth that the foot may cruſh them,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, She is deſcribed, by her unnaturalneſs to her young ones, when her eggs are hatched; this we have at the 16th <hi>verſe, She is hardned againſt her young ones, as though they were not hers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, She is deſcribed, by that which is the reaſon of both the former, her want of wiſdom and underſtanding, at the 17th <hi>verſe,</hi> which <hi>verſe</hi> tells us alſo whence it comes to paſs, that ſhe hath ſo little of theſe excellent endowments, even <hi>Becauſe God hath deprived her of wiſdom,</hi> &amp;c. As if he had ſaid, if you would know a reaſon, or have an account, why the Oſtrich is thus for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getful of her eggs, thus unnatural to her young ones, it is this, <hi>God hath deprived her of wiſdom, neither hath he imparted unto her underſtanding.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="386" facs="tcp:48669:204"/>
                  <p>The Fourth thing which ſhe is deſcribed by, is her ſwiftneſs of foot or wing, for both are here to be taken in, teſtified by her ſcorn and contempt of her ſwifteſt purſuers; <hi>When ſhe lifteth up her ſelf ſhe ſcorneth the Horſe and his Rider,</hi> at the 18th <hi>verſe.</hi> Thus you have the parts of this context, with reſpect to theſe two winged Creatures or Fowls of the Air here (according to our reading) deſcribed <hi>the Peacock and the Oſtrich.</hi> Thus the Lord having ſhewed his unſearchable wiſdom, ſhadowed in thoſe other creatures formerly enquired of, proceeds ſtill in the ſame argument, though upon a different ſubject. The power, wiſdom and providential care of God, is manifeſted in and about all his creatures; as much in and about the feathered-fowls of the Air, as the four-footed beaſts of the earth, of one kind or other.</p>

<pb n="387" facs="tcp:48669:204"/> why the learned <hi>Bochartus</hi> is perſwaded that the Oſtrich is here intended, becauſe the Peacock hath not goodly wings as the Oſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich hath, all the moſt beautiful feathers of the Peacock being placed in his tail or train, which is richly painted and adorned with various well-ſhadowed colours to the eye, when he ſpreads his tail, and prides himſelf in his plumes.

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto the Peacock?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Vulgar Latine tranſlates, <hi>the wing of the Oſtrich, is like the wing of the Hawke;</hi> but that tranſlation is ſo wide, that one ſaith, <hi>Who reading this, wonders not at the ſtrangneſs of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation?</hi> The Greek tranſlation of the Septuagint is as wide and dark as that, I ſhall not trouble the Reader about either, nor about many more which he may find collected, not only by <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chartus,</hi> but by ſeveral others.</p>
                  <p>The word which we tranſlate <hi>Peacocks</hi> in the plural number, comes from a root which ſignifies <hi>to cry, or to make a loud noiſe,</hi> to make a cry in joy and triumph, and ſo it may be rendred, <hi>The wings or feathers of rejoycers and triumphers.</hi> The Peacock may well be ſo called, becauſe he is a loud-voiced ſhrieking bird, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying as it were, and triumphing in his wings and feathers. The very nature and qualities both of beaſts and birds, are often and elegantly expreſt in the Hebrew names. <hi>Gaveſt thou the goodly wings to the Peacocks?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence Note, Firſt;
<q>God will be owned even in beſtowing feathers upon the birds.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here the Lord takes off <hi>Job</hi> from having any hand in that gift, much more from having the ſole hand in it. The workmanſhip of God may be ſeen, and is to be acknowledged, even in this, the feathers of a bird; and if the leaſt, the ſmalleſt things, among good things, are of God, how much more the greateſt! If it be of God, that the Peacock hath his feathers? how much more
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:48669:205"/> that man hath reaſon, that man hath wiſdom and underſtanding! how much more that man hath grace and holineſs! every good gift, and every perfect gift cometh from above; God will be owned, even in a feather, in the wing of a fowl. <hi>Gaveſt thou?</hi> not thou, but I.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, In that God takes it upon himſelf to have given fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to the Peacock, or to have made her feathers.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve,
<q>God hath a care to provide every way for the neceſſity of the creature, even of the unreaſonable creatures, whether thoſe that move upon the earth, or thoſe that fly in the air.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>We read before, how the Lord feeds the Lions, how he feeds the Ravens, how he feeds the wild Aſſes, how he provides food for Unicorns, and here he would have us take notice, how he provides clothing for the birds; feathers, are to the birds their clothing; they are to all birds good and warm clothing, and to ſome beautiful and goodly clothing. While Chriſt (<hi>Mat.</hi> 6.26.28.) ſpake of clothing the Lillies, and of feeding the Fowls of the Air, he would from thence infer an argument of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly care of God over his people; Now in that God gives a clothing of feathers to the Fowls, and doth not leave them naked, it holds forth theſe three things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It is an evidence or proof of the goodneſs and munifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of God, in providing ſufficiently for the comfortable ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence of all his creatures, and for the ornament of ſome of them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, 'Tis a confirmation of his childrens faith, in and dependance upon him for outward things, for meat and cloathing, with all neceſſaries of this life.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, 'Tis a reproof of their diſtruſt and unbelief, with reſpect to outward things. Certainly, the Lord who hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided feathers for the Fowls of the Air, will provide clothing for his children and faithful ſervants.</p>
                  <p>Further, conſider; The Lord hath not only given wings or feathers to the Peacock, but the Text ſaith, he hath given <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wings</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="389" facs="tcp:48669:205"/>
                  <p>Hence learn, Thirdly;
<q>All birds are not of a feather.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>That is, God doth not give alike, no, not to birds. Some fowls of the air have feathers only for their uſe, or to ſerve their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity; all fowls of the air have not gay feathers, nor goodly wings; all of them have not painted feathers,<note place="margin">Producit ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum avium pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas exempli loco ut oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dat ſe non tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum neceſſarium victum ſed eti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am ornatum dare animali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus.

God gives cloathing to all, but not goodly cloathing, not rich cloathing; to ſome he gives goodly cloathing, he puts a glory upon their garments; he cloaths ſome with ſcarlet, and puts ornaments upon their apparel, as <hi>David</hi> in his mourning ſong ſpake of <hi>Saul,</hi> adorning his ſubjects, the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1, 23, 24.) When <hi>Abraham</hi> ſent his ſervant to woo for his ſon <hi>Iſaac,</hi> or to fetch a wife for him, he ſent <hi>goodly cloathing;</hi> his ſervant <hi>brought forth jewels of ſilver, and jewels of gold, and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and gave them to Rebekah (Gen.</hi> 24.53.) <hi>Joſeph (Gen.</hi> 45.22.) gave all his brethren <hi>changes of raiment; but to</hi> Benjamin <hi>he gave three hundred pieces of ſilver, and five changes of raiment.</hi> Thus the Lord deals with men and women in this world; all have apparel to cover their nakedneſs, and defend them from the ſharpneſs of a Winter ſeaſon, but ſome have goodly apparel.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, In that theſe goodly wings given to the Peacock, are by ſome rendred <hi>proud wings,</hi> and by others <hi>boaſting wings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note;
<q>There is a temptation in gay worldly things, to puff up the mind with pride.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The very Peacock having fine feathers, over-weenes himſelf, and is proud of them. As we ſay, <hi>Fine feathers, make fine birds,</hi>
                     <pb n="390" facs="tcp:48669:206"/> ſo we may ſay, <hi>Fine feathers, make proud birds.</hi> And no wonder if it be ſo with ſilly birds; for even wiſe men, if they receive any thing that is goodly from the hand of God, are very apt to be as proud of it, as the Peacock of his goodly wings. If the Lord doth but give us a few gay feathers, a little more riches than others, a little more honour than others (theſe are gay feathers) or if the Lord give us better and higher parts than others (theſe are gayer feathers) How hard is it for us to keep down high thoughts, or not to ſoar high upon theſe wings and feathers, in admiting thoughts and airy conceits of our ſelves, though the holy Ghoſt every where way-layeth the pride of our hearts by many arguments, by this eſpecially, becauſe all we have is given us by God, and we have nothing of our own. The Lord hath given man many goodly feathers, beauty and ſtrength of body to many, riches and honor to not a few, wit, learning, eloquence to ſome, and to others ſpiritual gifts and graces, which are the goodlieſt feathers of all. Now ſeing, all theſe are given us, why ſhould we be proud of any one of them? yea, how humble ſhould we be, though adorned with them all! Hence that Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical check to proud ones (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7.) <hi>What haſt thou that thou didſt not receive? and if thou haſt received it, why doſt thou glory or boaſt, as if thou hadſt not received it?</hi> In theſe words he more than implyeth two things; Firſt, That they who have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived thoſe goodlier feathers of ſpiritual gifts and graces, are in danger of being lifted up by them. Secondly, That they ought not. The Angels who fell, had goodly feathers, and they were lifted up, not only in pride with what they had received, and were beholding to God for, but in pride to have more, or get higher, and not be beholding to God for it. There is a temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in any good thing, a great temptation in goodly things, to pride; and therefore we had need to pray when we have any thing that is goodly, whether it be natural, civil, moral, or ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, to be kept humble and preſerved from pride. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was in danger <hi>to be exalted above meaſure, through the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the revelations</hi> which he had, <hi>when caught up to the third heaven</hi> (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.3, 7.) The beſt men on earth may be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heated by what they have received from heaven, and the fleſh may take occaſion, as, <hi>by the commandement to work in us all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of concupiſcence (Rom.</hi> 7.8.) ſo, by our raptures in ſpirit, to
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:48669:206"/> puff us up with that ſpecial concupiſcence called pride.</p>
                  <p>The Peacock here ſpoken of, is ſo far tranſported with his fine feathers, that he may be called the picture of pride. We have a common ſaying in our language, <hi>Such a one is as proud as a Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cock;</hi> or, <hi>he is a proud Peacock.</hi> A Peacock and a proud perſon are alike in ſeveral things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, As the Peacock is proud of his feathers, ſo is he of his cloaths. One of the Ancients reproving pride in cloathing, ſaid,<note place="margin">In habitu non calor ſed color requiritur, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſ<expan>
                           <am>
                              <g ref="char:abque"/>
                           </am>
                           <ex>que</ex>
                        </expan> veſtium quam virtutum cultui inſiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. <hi>Bern.</hi>
                     </note> in his time, <hi>It is not ſo much the warmth of their cloathing, but the curious dye or colour of the cloth which is regarded; and moſt inſiſt more upon the trimming of their veſtures, than upon the increaſe of their vertues.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, A Peacock, as he is proud of his feathers, ſo he loves they ſhould be ſeen, or he loves to ſhew his fine feathers. The Peacock ſpreads his plumes, ſo doth a proud perſon. Not only he that is proud of his apparel affects to be ſeen, but he that is proud of his gifts, knowledge, learning, eloquence, how doth he ſpread theſe plumes, and affect applauſe! As the vain-glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Phariſees thought nothing they did in Religion worth the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, unleſs they were ſeen in doing it; ſo vain-glorious perſons think nothing they have worth the having, unleſs they make o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſee they have it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, A proud man is like to the Peacock in his exulting cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous voice or cry: Such love to talk high, and are very loud; they love to be heard as well as ſeen, and to hear themſelves ſpeak in the hearing of others.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The Peacock (ſay Naturaliſts) however he hath ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry goodly feathers, yet hath but a very weak head.<note place="margin">Pavo infirmum habet caput, ſuperbus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becille judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium.</note> 'Tis ſo with proud perſons; whatever fine ſhews they make, their intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals are but courſe; and they that are proud of the ſtrength of their heads, of their wit and underſtandings, have indeed the weakeſt heads of all. There is much folly lodged in that mans head, where much knowledge lodgeth, if pride lodge in his heart too. And ſeeing God gives (in this ſenſe) fooliſh men (as this fooliſh bird) fine feathers, we need not envy them; for their folly in being proud of their fine feathers, debaſeth them more in the ſight of God, than their fine feathers can honour them in the ſight of men. Uſually proud perſons have little that is good in them; but how much ſoever they have, it will be little more
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:48669:207"/> to them than a fine feather, becauſe they think it ſo much, that they are proud of it.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Naturaliſts ſay, the Peacock (and it is as true of a proud perſon) is <hi>an Angel in aſpect,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Angelus aſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctu, pede latro, voce Gehenna.</note> or to look on (he makes a goodly ſhew) <hi>a thief in his foot, i. e.</hi> he goeth ſoftly without noiſe, yet <hi>hath a voice like hell,</hi> crying out and ſhrieking very unharmoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to the ear. A proud perſon may be an Angel in aſpect, but he is a thief in his feet, he goeth ſoftly, yet deceitfully; and there is a hell in his voice. A loud boaſting tongue is as troubleſom and unpleaſant to the ear, as a brawling; and uſually boaſters are braw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers too: For, as <hi>Solomon</hi> hath concluded it (<hi>Prov.</hi> 13.10.) <hi>By pride cometh contention.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Proud ones are like the Peacock, becauſe <hi>that which perſons are moſt commonly proud of, is of little worth.</hi> The Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cock is proud of his feathers, which are worthleſs things, fit only for children to play with. And though it is a truth, that ſome men (as was ſaid before) are proud of ſuch things as are excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in themſelves, and of a great intrinſick value, yet (as was alſo ſaid before) whatſoever a man is proud of, will (to his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count) be no better than a Peacocks feather. A man that is proud of his beauty and apparel, of his riches and outward ſplendor, may truly be ſaid to be proud of a feather; <hi>Solomon,</hi> the wiſeſt of Kings, and taught by the Spirit of God, hath written vanity and inſufficiency upon all worldly things. And if a man be proud of his underſtanding, knowledge, or any internal endowment (which are things of real excellency) they all become vain to him; yea, if a man be proud of his graces, though they ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be utterly vain to him, yet ſo far as he is proud of them, they are vain to him, being hindred by the preſent prevailings of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, from doing that which is one of the moſt proper works of them, the keeping him humble, empty, and nothing in his own eyes. <hi>Gaveſt thou goodly wings to the Peacocks,</hi>
                     <q>And wings and feathers unto the Oſtrich?</q>
                  </p>

                     </note> yet is ſometimes taken to ſignifie the fowl it ſelf, or a feathered fowl; and becauſe the Oſtrich hath the richeſt and moſt beautiful feathers, therefore it is here tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>the Oſtrich.</hi> The feathers of the Oſtrich being that for which ſhe is moſt famous, the Oſtrich her ſelf may (not inelegantly) be expreſſed by a word, which properly and ſtrictly taken, ſignifies nothing but a feather; but moſt interpreters taking that word in its proper ſenſe to ſignifie a feather, take the former word, which firſtly and properly ſignifies a <hi>Stork,</hi> for <hi>the Oſtrich. Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt thou wings and feathers to the Oſtrich.</hi> The reaſon, I conceive, why that word <hi>(Chaſidah)</hi> which properly ſignifieth a <hi>Stork,</hi> is here rendred <hi>an Oſtrich,</hi> is becauſe the deſcription given of the bird here intended in the five verſes following, doth no way a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with the Stork, but fairly with the Oſtrich; for the Stork (ſay Naturaliſts) is of a very good and pittiful nature, and hath its name from a root in the Hebrew, which ſignifies <hi>kindneſs, pitty and tenderneſs,</hi> whereas the creature here deſcribed, is void of all theſe, as will appear in opening this context. And therefore Grammarians tell us, that the Oſtrich is ſo called by the rule of contraries, merciful or kind, for unkind and cruel; which way of ſpeaking is uſual in the Hebrew, as alſo in other languages. Thus the Hebrew word for a <hi>Harlot,</hi> ſignifies one that <hi>is holy;</hi> Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots being moſt unholy, filthy, and unclean women, proſtituting their bodies to the luſts of others, and inviting them to unlawful pleaſures.</p>
                  <p>And that we are not here to underſtand the Stork properly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, but the Oſtrich, is plain for theſe three reaſons; the firſt of which hath been already intimated, the bird here intended being of a quite contrary nature to the ſtork. Secondly, The Stork hath no ſuch beautiful feathers as ſeem to be given to the bird here ſpoken of, yet we muſt not believe that all thoſe beautiful co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours in which Oſtriches feathers are ſeen and worn, are natural to them; for ſhe hath no feathers of note, of any colour growing on her, but black and white, all others are died and artificial. Thirdly, The Stork doth not lay her eggs on the ground, but builds on high in trees (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.17.) <hi>As for the Stork, the Firr-trees are her houſe,</hi> whereas the bird here mentioned, goes upon the ground; though ſhe hath wings, yet not wings able to
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:48669:208"/> lift her up to a tree,<note place="margin">Struthio eſt avis quaedam appropinquans ad genus beſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum; unde licet hab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Some creatures are of two kinds in one, liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing partly upon the earth, and partly in the water; here the Oſtrich may upon another account be numbred among theſe, he uſing the wing to ſlutter a little in the air like a bird, yet moſtly like a beaſt moving upon the earth.

                  <p>Upon theſe grounds and conſiderations it is, that all theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters, who will have but one fowl of the air to be intended in this part of the Text, fix upon the <hi>Oſtrich,</hi> not upon the <hi>Stork;</hi> though the word <hi>Chaſidah,</hi> which they tranſlate <hi>Oſtrich,</hi> doth properly ſignifie the <hi>Stork.</hi>

Why may we not (ſay they) take in both, and ſo render the Text thus, <hi>Who gave wings to the Stork and the Oſtrich?</hi> and ſo all difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties will be removed, and the word <hi>Renanim</hi> reſerved free for the Peacock.</p>
                  <p>But foraſmuch as our tranſlation puts the Oſtrich alone into the Text, I ſhall not add any thing concerning the nature of the <hi>Stork,</hi> but only of the Oſtrich; <hi>Gaveſt thou wings and feathers to the Oſtrich?</hi>

                  <p>The word rendred <hi>wings,</hi> ſignifies <hi>ſtrength;</hi> the ſtrength of birds is in their wings (as of man in his arms) and ſome birds are exceeding <hi>ſtrong of wing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The word rendred by us <hi>feathers,</hi> ſignifies in the root to <hi>flie,</hi> becauſe feathers are the inſtruments of flying; yet others derive
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:48669:208"/> it from a word, which ſignifies to grow or flouriſh, becauſe fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers grow and flouriſh upon fowls, as herbs and flowers out of, and upon the ground. And the reaſon why ſome conceive the Oſtrich is meant by this word <hi>(Notſa)</hi> which we tranſlate <hi>fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> is becauſe the feathers of the Oſtrich are ſo like beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful flowers, or a goodly garland of flowers. Great Princes in all ages having adorned their hats or hair with the plumes of the Oſtrich, ſet in ouches of gold, and beſpangled with the rareſt gems or precious ſtones.</p>
                  <p>What the nature, the cuſtoms and qualities of the Oſtrich are, will appear in opening the latter part of this context. All that I ſhall add here, is,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To ſet down more fully the deſcription which the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Hiſtorian gives of her. <hi>The African and Ethiopian Oſtriches</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>are the greateſt of birds, even as big as a beaſt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Plin. l. 10 c. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>in height they are taller than a horſe and his rider ſitting on his back; they alſo exceed the horſe in ſwiftneſs of foot, their wings ſeeming to be given them only to help them in running, for they can ſcarcely flie at all, or lift themſelves much above ground. They are cloven-foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or hoof-forked like a Hart, their hoofs or claws ſerving them to gather up ſtones, which in their flight or retreat, they throw back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward upon ſuch as hunt them. They have an admirable concoction, digeſting the hardeſt things which they ſwallow down; nor is their folly leſs admirable, thinking themſelves ſufficiently hid, when their heads are. Their eggs ſerve for cups to drink in, and their feathers adorn the creſts and helmets of the Warrior.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And beſides the beauty of her feathers, their equality or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venneſs is ſo remarkable, that among the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> the feather of an Oſtrich was taken for the ſymbol of equity; ſo that when they would ſignifie a man of an equal ſpirit and converſation to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all men, and in all things, they uſed to paint the feather of an Oſtrich.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I ſhall add this alſo; That as in the Peacock we had the repreſentation of a proud perſon, ſo in the Oſtrich the live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly image or picture of an Hypocrite, which may be held out and made good in theſe five particulars.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The Oſtrich is a kind of middle creature (as was ſaid) between a bird that flies in the air, and a beaſt that goes upon the ground, having ſomewhat of both, yet is properly neither.
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:48669:209"/> Thus it is with the Hypocrite or falſe-hearted Chriſtian; He ſtands between a godly man and a profane man,<note place="margin">Sunt animalia amphi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> he is neither; he is not profane, in ſtrict ſenſe (though really he be ſo, as the Hebrew word for a Hypocrite imports, yet (I ſay) in ſtrict ſenſe he is not profane) becauſe he makes a profeſſion, and appears to men in a form of godlineſs; yet he is not godly, becauſe he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly makes a profeſſion, and appears in a form of godlineſs, either denying, or at leaſt, not having any power of godlineſs. A Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite hangs, as I may ſay, between God and man, between the wayes of holineſs, and the ways of ſin; he either halts between two Religions, as <hi>Elijah</hi> told the <hi>Jews</hi> (1 <hi>King.</hi> 18.21.) or takes not one right ſtep in that one which he pretends to; he is (as it was ſaid of the Church of <hi>Laodicea) neither hot nor cold,</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween both, <hi>luke-warm.</hi> As the Oſtrich is a creature between two, ſomething like a fowl of the air, and ſomething like a beaſt of the earth, or (as the Latine word for an Oſtrich implies) <hi>A Camel winged, a winged Camel;</hi> ſo is a Hypocrite, a kind of a middle-man, between a good man and a bad, in appearance ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good, but in truth and reality ſtark naught; and by ſo much worſe than the worſt of profane ones, by how much he had a mind to appear better than the beſt, at leaſt among the beſt of holy ones.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, This Oſtrich, as he is deſcribed, is a creature with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out natural affection; and ſo the Hypocrite and falſe-hearted profeſſor, is alwayes without ſpiritual, Chriſtian, gracious affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and very often without natural and meer humane affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. That's one part of the character which the Apoſtle gives of thoſe who have a form of godlineſs, but deny the power (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.3.)</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Oſtrich hath feathers, but cannot flie; the Oſtrich ſpreads her wings as if ſhe would flie aloft, yet cannot make a lofty flight; ſhe raiſeth her ſelf no higher above the earth, than a man may hop or leap; her body or earthly part is ſo ponderous, that her wings cannot raiſe her far into the air, much leſs bear her up long there. It is ſo with the Hypocrite, he hath wings, and he ſeems to ſpread them, as if he had ſtrong deſire, and great deſignes heaven-wards; he would make you believe he is both from and for above, yet he cannot get off the earth; he is
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:48669:209"/> an <hi>earthly minded man,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks of ſuch,<note place="margin">Coeleſtia ſe quaerere ſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantes, terrenis adhaerem.</note> though as to an outward profeſſion, and ſome formal actions, he ſeems to ſoar aloft, and live above the world, yet he ever drives an earthly trade, and hath ſome baſe carnal aime or other, in his higheſt ſervices. The earth is every natural mans center, and therefore though (as any heavy body, a ſtone or clod of clay) he may be forced upward, yet when that impreſſion is ſpent, he falls down again to earthly things, which only are connatural to him.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The Oſtrich is a creature of a mighty digeſtion, of a hot ſtomack; and therefore is painted and figured with a piece of iron in her mouth, implying, ſhe digeſts iron.<note place="margin">Omnia digerere poteſt Struthio.</note> Thus the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite can digeſt the hardeſt things, even that which is harder than iron, ſin; that which lieth upon the ſtomack of a godly man as heavy as a ſtone, that is, which burdens his conſcience, that the hypocrite can ſwallow, it goes down eaſily with him, and is as eaſily digeſted; he can ſwallow this and that ſin without trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, eſpecially, if he can but do it unſeen or in ſecret; he makes no bones (as we ſay) of any thing, which may but feed ſome luſt, he hath a conſcience wide enough, and hot enough, and ſtrong enough to digeſt iron, any unlawful deed if it ſerve his turn, or may tu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n to his worldly advantage. That which a man truly fearing God, and ſtrongly reſolved to do his known will, and nothing elſe knowingly, cannot will, not do, nor touch with for a world, that he can do, and will do for ſome poor pittances, much more for the great things of the world.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith, the Oſtrich being a very tall creature,<note place="margin">Tanta eorum ſtoliditas, ut cum colla fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice occulta be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rint latere ſe exiſtimant. <hi>Plin. l. 10. c. 1.</hi>
                     </note> is yet ſo fooliſh, that if ſhe hide her head, ſhe thinks herſelf all hid and ſafe from danger; ſhe concludes no man ſees her, if ſhe ſees no man. Thus it is with the hypocrite, if he can but be out of ſight himſelf, he thinks none ſee him, no not God himſelf (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 94.6, 7.) <hi>They ſlay the widdow and the ſtranger, and murther the fatherleſs; yet they ſay, the Lord ſhall not ſee, neither ſhall the God of</hi> Jacob <hi>regard it.</hi> They think they do all in ſuch ſecrecy, that as men do not, ſo God ſhall not behold it.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, The Oſtrich hath very gay feathers, of much more worth than the Peacock, yet the Oſtrich hath no more wit than the Peacock; one is the embleme of a proud man, the other of a hypocrite, both bravely clothed, yet with nothing but feathers.</p>
                  <pb n="398" facs="tcp:48669:210"/>
                  <p>From both, I would infer theſe two or three things, which may hold out much of the mind of God in this diſcourſe with <hi>Job,</hi> and which ſome Interpreters conceive God chiefly aimed at in this place, by telling <hi>Job</hi> or minding him, that he had given good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wings, and gay feathers to Peacocks and Oſtriches. We ſee thoſe creatures which have little worth in themſelves, have very goodly ornaments put upon them by the hand of God. Hence we may infer,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>God oftentimes beſtoweth the gay and glitter of worldly things upon the worſt, the unworthieſt among the ſons of men;</hi> upon ſuch as have no more wiſdom in them, than a Peacock or an Oſtrich. And if ſo, then</p>
                  <p>Secondly, take this inference; <hi>We ſhould not envy any ſort of men in the world their gay feathers. Job</hi> ſtumbled at this, and ſo did <hi>David,</hi> who ſaid of himſelf, <hi>I was envious at the fooliſh, when I ſaw the proſperity of the wicked (Pſal.</hi> 73.3.) <hi>David</hi> was troubled to ſee them garniſhed and trim'd like Peacocks and Oſtriches, flaunting with their feathers, while he poor man was chaſtned every morning; yet he quickly ſaw he had little reaſon for this trouble, when once he went into the <hi>ſanctuary;</hi> For there he learned in what a ſlippery place they ſtood, and therefore called himſelf <hi>ignorant fool and beaſt,</hi> for envying them their gayeſt feathers, their greateſt proſperity. (<hi>ver.</hi> 22.) Let it not offend us to behold bad men in the beſt array. Is any man offended becauſe a Peacock or an Oſtrich hath ſuch goodly feathers? Surely, no man ought to complain of or find fault with the diſpenſations of God, becauſe he hath beſtowed a richer ſuit of feathers upon the proud Peacock and the fooliſh Oſtrich, than he hath upon the pious, kind-hearted, well-natur'd Storke, or the innocent Dove. Why then ſhould any be offended or murmur, if God give the good things of the world to thoſe that have no more goodneſs than Peacocks or Oſtriches, if he fills and adorns ſome bad men, with better things of this life, than many that are good? The Prophet (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 17.4.) gives the deſcription of an Eagle, having <hi>long wings, and embroydered fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or feathers of many colours.</hi> Yet that Eagle was but a Heathen Prince, and he none of the beſt, though one of the greateſt of that ſort. <hi>Bad men have their embroiderirs,</hi> the paint of an earthly glory, and that is all the portion, all the good they
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:48669:210"/> are ever like to have; As <hi>Abraham</hi> told the rich man in the Parable (<hi>Luk.</hi> 16.) <hi>Who was cloathed with purple and fine linnen, and fared deliciouſly every day while he lived; Son remember thou haſt had thy good things.</hi> Fine cloaths and delicious fare is the all of good (and how poor an all is that) which ſome men deſire, and which any ungodly man ſhall receive from the hand of God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, We may infer; <hi>Let all learn to be content with, and thankful for their own clothing or portion in this world, though it be but mean, courſe or plain, and much inferiour to what they ſee others have.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Argumentum videtur eſſe tale. Sicut quaelibet avis ſuis plumis, ita tu, O <hi>Job,</hi> &amp; alii homines ſua ſorte con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenti eſſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent. <hi>Scult.</hi>
                     </note> Thoſe birds which have but poor feathers are ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with them, as well as the Peacock and the Oſtrich with their gaudy ones. By this argument God would perſwade <hi>Job,</hi> to be quiet and patient, though his clothing at that time was very mean, yea, though all the gay feathers of his former proſperity were pluckt oft and he ſtript naked, as he (poor man) ſaid at the 21th <hi>verſe</hi> of the firſt <hi>Chapter; Naked came I out of my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers womb, and naked ſhall I return thither,</hi> that is, to the womb of the earth, mans common parent. Though we <hi>make not a fair ſhew</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſaith ſome deſired to do, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.12.) <hi>in the fleſh;</hi> though we have not ſuch goodly feathers on our backs, in our outward robes as others have, let us be thankful for a dreſs of the meaneſt clothing, and patient though dreſſed in ſackcloth. God is a ſoveraign Lord, he is at his liberty to give goodly wings and glorious feathers to this bird, and plain ones to another: And the ſame liberty he may and doth take and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe when and where he pleaſeth, among the children of men. <hi>Gaveſt thou the goodly wings to the Peacocks? or wings and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to the Oſtrich?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Lord having thus deſcribed the Oſtrich by her outſide, her wings and feathers, proceeds to ſhew her inſide, her diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition and qualities. And we might expect, that a creature cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſuch lovely wings and feathers, would have had ſome lovely and rare qualities, whereas the Oſtrich hath not one that's commendable, all that is ſaid of her ſignifying an ignoble diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For firſt, ſhe is forgetful and careleſs of that, which ſhe ſhould be very careful of.</p>

This (I ſay) is contrary to the nature of other birds, who lay their eggs in neſts, as much as they can from danger, but <hi>ſhe leaveth them in the earth,</hi>

Several Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours affirm, that the eggs thus left, are hatcht by the heat or warmth of the Sun. This <hi>Rochartus</hi> rejects as a meer dream, affirming, That all her eggs, ſo left in the ſands, are corrupted, not hatched; and tells us from others, that the Oſtrich having forgotten where ſhe left her own eggs, happening upon the eggs of ſome other Oſtrich, ſits upon and hatches them; according to which, the <hi>Chaldee</hi> ſaith, <hi>She brings young ones which are not truly hers.</hi> But I leave theſe things to the conſideration of the Reader.</p>
                  <pb n="401" facs="tcp:48669:211"/>
                  <p>Others give two reaſons, why the Oſtrich leaves her eggs in the duſt, and doth not ſit upon them; both which are very unſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to what God himſelf ſaith of the Oſtrich. Firſt, (They ſay) ſhe leaveth them and warms them in the duſt, leſt ſhe ſhould break them with the weight of her body; but doubtleſs there is no fowl ſo heavy, but may ſit on her eggs, and not break them. The leaſt bird that ſits upon eggs may break them if ſhe be careleſs, and the greateſt may preſerve them by care. Beſides, an Oſtriches egg is a very hard egg, and not eaſily broken; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſurely, that cannot be the reaſon. Secondly, That ſhe doth not ſit upon her eggs her ſelf, becauſe ſhe wanteth feathers; her under parts being bare and naked, and ſo very unfit to yield warmth. But if the Oſtrich did thus upon a natural inſtinct, there would be no reaſon to charge her with folly, or to ſay God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived her of wiſdom; for as the former reaſon, ſo this would prove her to be a wiſe and provident creature, therefore we muſt lay the reaſon ſomewhere elſe.

                  <p>The Hebrew is <hi>threſh them,</hi> which implyeth more than crack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, even breaking them all to pieces.</p>
                  <p>Thus we ſee what report God himſelf makes of the Oſtrich; but many other things are reported of the Oſtrich by natural Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians, which we have no reaſon to believe, becauſe they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict the report which the Lord here makes of her, unleſs they mean ſome other ſort of Oſtrich than is here deſcribed.<note place="margin">Aelianus <hi>l.</hi> 4. c. 6. 36.</note> For <hi>Aelian</hi> tells us, The Oſtrich ſits diligently upon her eggs, till the young ones are hatcht, and then is very tender over them. Both which the Lord denies concerning the Oſtrich in the Text, while
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:48669:212"/> he ſaith, <hi>She leaveth her eggs in the earth, and warmeth them in the duſt, and forgetteth that the foot may cruſh them,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Hence note, Firſt;
<q>Among unreaſonable creatures beaſts or birds, there are ſome farther from reaſon than others are.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though none of the beaſts of the earth, or fowls of the air, have Reaſon, properly ſo called (that's the priviledge of Angels and Men) yet there are ſome of them, that by a natural inſtinct, ſhew a great deal of reaſon in what they do, both as to their own preſervation, and the proviſion which they make for their young ones; in which latter reſpect, eſpecially this Scripture, takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the deficiency of the Oſtrich.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Foraſmuch as the ſpirit of God reports this as the folly of the Oſtrich, that ſhe leaves her eggs to ſo much hazzard and danger,</p>
                  <p>Obſerve;
<q>To leave any thing in danger, or not to provide againſt danger, is a great argument of folly.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is a great piece of wiſdom to foreſee danger, and a greater to provide well againſt it. <hi>A prudent man</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 22.3.) <hi>foreſeeth the evil, and hideth himſelf: but the ſimple puſs on, and are puniſhed. Noah</hi> heard of the flood, and <hi>being warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of God, moved with fear</hi> (he both feared God, and was afraid of the danger) <hi>prepared an Ark to the ſaving of his houſe,</hi> that is, his houſhold and family. In all caſes, as 'tis our wiſdom to forſee danger, ſo 'tis our duty to provide againſt danger; not to leave our eggs, any thing we have, much leſs our lives, leaſt of all our own ſouls, or the ſouls of others, in danger. How many leave the ſouls of their children, the ſouls of their relations in the earth, yea, to the earth, or (as we ſay) to the wide world; and forget what ſnares, what temptations they may fall into, what foot may cruſh them, what wild beaſt may tread upon them; yea, many that have the charge of ſouls, as Miniſters, leave their flocks, and forget the danger that may come to them, they forget that the foot may cruſh them, that Satan, and thoſe wild beaſts, their luſts, may ruin and deſtroy them. We may ſay to ſuch, as <hi>Eliab,</hi> the elder brother of <hi>David,</hi> ſaid to him (when he was ſent by his
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:48669:212"/> father to viſit his brethren in the Camp) (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.28.) <hi>With whom haſt thou left thoſe few ſheep in the wilderneſs?</hi> doſt thou know what will become of thy ſheep? thou haſt left them for Lions and Bears to devoure and to tear. So we may ſay to many (who are hardened like the Oſtrich againſt her eggs) with whom have you left your flocks? with whom have you left thoſe few ſheep, thoſe poor ſouls left under your charge? may not wild beaſts, Bears and Lions deſtroy them? Not to foreſee danger, ſhews ſome want of prudence; but not to provide againſt danger foreſeen, is an argument of greateſt folly.</p>
                  <p>Again, conſider this fooliſh creature the Oſtrich, leaves her eggs at (as we ſay) ſixes and ſevens, and is gone, ſhe never troubles her ſelf more with them, yet they are preſerved, and her kind is continued, though little thanks to her.</p>
                  <p>Hence we learn, Thirdly;
<q>There is a wonderful providence of God the Creator, watching over thoſe things which are left in hazzard, by the folly of man or of any other creature.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>By how much the Oſtrich is more neglectful, by ſo much the providence of God is more watchful. In the careleſneſs of the creature, how doth the care of God ſhine forth! when they that are ingaged to, or ſhould provide for the good of others, or to prevent their evil, neglect that duty, how wonderful is the goodneſs and kindneſs of God in providing for them, and protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them! <hi>David</hi> had this confidence (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.10.) <hi>When my father and my mother</hi> (like the Oſtrich) <hi>forſake me</hi> (that is, though my father and mother ſhould prove ſo unnatural, as to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake me, and expoſe me to the wide world) <hi>yet the Lord will take me up.</hi> How good is God, who takes care for them, for whom neareſt relations take none! The Prophet puts this queſtion,<note place="margin">Quanto ſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thio-camelus ſtotidior eſt, &amp; ſuorum ovorum oblitior, tanto Dei providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia ſolicitur &amp; benignior.</note> as if the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative anſwer were out of queſtion (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.15.) <hi>Can a woman forget</hi> (like the Oſtrich her eggs) <hi>her ſucking child, that ſhe ſhould not have compaſſion on the ſon of her womb?</hi> Surely, if the anſwer were to be made to this queſtion in the light of nature, would it not be this? She cannot, 'tis impoſſible ſhe ſhould. But how doth the ſpirit of God anſwer in the Text? Not abſolute in the negative, ſhe cannot; nor abſolutely in the affirmatively, ſhe will; but mixtly or comparatively; <hi>Yea, they may forget;
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:48669:213"/> yet will I not forget thee;</hi> that is, though it would be a very ſtrange thing if they ſhould, yet poſſibly they may, but 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that I ſhould forget thee. Or thus, though women ſhould turn Oſtriches, and forget their own iſſue, yet <hi>will I not forget thee;</hi> that is, I will have thee in everlaſting remembrance, as it followeth in the next words of the Prophet (<hi>verſ.</hi> 16.) <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold! I have graven thee upon the palmes of my hands, thy walls are continually before me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as the Lord will not forget his <hi>Sion,</hi> the Church, nor leave her to the danger of being cruſht by every foot; ſo whatever is left to hazard or danger, whether, Firſt, by any unreaſonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as here in the Text; Or ſecondly, by unreaſonable and fooliſh men (from whom to be delivered the Apoſtle begged earneſtly, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.2.) Or Thirdly, which the wiſeſt men, with all their care, and power, and diligence cannot ſecure from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and hazzard; there is a wakeful eye of providence, that will take care in all ſuch caſes, eſpecially, in the laſt. For, when men have done their utmoſt, to keep the foot from cruſhing us, and the wild beaſts from deſtroying us, but canno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, then the care of God appears moſt in doing it. And in the caſe of that double neceſſity, when good men have done their beſt to keep us ſafe, but cannot; and bad men have done their worſt, to expoſe us unto, and leave us in danger, we may, and muſt leave all to God, who naturally takes care of all creatures, and is the Saviour of all men (both as to temporal and eternal ſalvation, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10.) eſpecially of them that believe.</p>
                  <p>Thus we have the firſt part of the deſcription of the Oſtrich, who being ſo very fooliſh, not to diſcharge her duty to her eggs, God himſelf doth it, his providence orders the Sun to warm them, and the Sand to bring them forth. And as the Oſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich is careleſs of her eggs, before they are hatcht, ſo ſhe neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects her young ones as much when they are hatcht, as is ſhewed in the next <hi>verſe.</hi>

                  <p>This <hi>verſe</hi> gives us a farther deſcription of that <hi>Bird-beaſt the Oſtrich,</hi> by her unnaturalneſs to her off-ſpring; having left her eggs careleſsly to hatch or periſh in the duſt, ſhe is as careleſs of
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:48669:213"/> her brood when they are hatched; when the heat of the Sun (ſay ſome) by the providence of God, hath done one part of her duty, to bring them forth, ſhe neglects the other part of her du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which is, to bring them up; and ſo the pains that ſhe took in laying ſo many great eggs (one tells us, her neſt is uſually ſto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Many parents harden their children by being hard to them. If we put the ſenſe of both readings together, it will make the

<q>They that deal hardly with others, are hardened againſt them.</q>

                  <p>When <hi>Pharoah</hi> dealt ſo extream hardly with the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when he increaſed their number of bricks, and denied them ſtraw, and made them ſerve with rigor, he was extreamly hardned againſt them.

The Miniſters of the Goſpel ſhould take heed that they harden not themſelves againſt the young ones of the flock, ſuch as are newly come in to Jeſus Chriſt, late Converts, <hi>Babes in Chriſt,</hi> as the Apoſtle calls them (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.1.) theſe ſhould be dealt tenderly with.

When any do ſo, are they not as the Oſtrich in the Text, hardned againſt their young ones, yea againſt thoſe that are with young?</p>

The Prophet (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.7.) puts it among the duties of a faſt, <hi>That thou hide not thy ſelf from thy own fleſh.</hi> Then we keep a true faſt, a faſt that God hath choſen, when we break our bread to the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, and bring the poor that are caſt out to our houſes; when we cloath the naked, and comfort the ſorrowful, not hiding our ſelves from our own fleſh; by w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>, though we are ſpecially to underſtand our kindred and neereſt relations in the fleſh, yet 'tis true of meer ſtrangers, of thoſe who are at furtheſt remove from us, as to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alliance or conſanguinity, if they need our help. God hath made all men <hi>of one fleſh,</hi> in the ſame ſenſe that he hath made all men <hi>of one blood (Act.</hi> 17.26.) and therefore to hide our ſelves from the help of any man in diſtreſs, is to hide our ſelves from our own fleſh. 'Tis much to be wondred, that a fooliſh bird ſhould be forgetful <hi>of her young ones, as though they were not hers;</hi> but it is to be abhorred in men and women, eſpecially in thoſe that profeſs the faith of Chriſt, that they ſhould no more look to them that are theirs, than as if they were not theirs. The Apoſtle gives this cenſure of, or ſentence upon all ſuch (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.8.) <hi>If any man provide not for his own, and eſpecially for thoſe of his own houſe,</hi> or (as the Margin hath it) <hi>kindred</hi> (if any man carry it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, as if they were not his) <hi>he hath denyed the faith, and</hi> (in that point) <hi>is worſe than an infidel;</hi> for the common light of nature teacheth infidels to take care of thoſe that are their own, and not to ſlight them, as if they were not theirs.</p>
                  <p>Farther note, Fourthly;
<q>The care of our relations (or of thoſe that are ours) doth not dwell in us meerly by nature, it is the gift of God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle deſcribing the beſt of Heathens (<hi>Rom.</hi> 1.) ſaith, <hi>They were without natural affection.</hi> Nature hath not of it ſelf na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural affections. That ſome beaſts of the earth, and birds of the air, are very ful of natural affection, none can deny; but it muſt be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted alſo, that God hath planted thoſe affections in them. If, that which we call natural affection, were purely from nature, then every bird and beaſt would have the ſame natural affection; but
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:48669:216"/> this Text tells us, the Oſtrich hath it not in her, ſhe hath no natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral affection at all towards her young ones; therefore there is ſomewhat in it beyond nature that any creature hath it; though we call it a natural inſtinct to do ſo,<note place="margin">Pro foetu curare non eſt naturae proprium, ſed Dei authoris. Si enim naturae eſſet, cur non &amp; in hac be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtia eluceret? <hi>Brent.</hi>
                     </note> yet nature is not alwayes furniſhed with it. In many creatures it is eminent, in others it is not at all apparent. How great and tender is the care of a Hen over her chickens? how eagerly will ſhe fight in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence? yet the Oſtrich will do no more for hers, than as if they were not hers; ſo that, were it not for the care and providence of God, who is the father of, and provider for all creatures, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them would be little cared or provided for.</p>
                  <p>The Text proceeds to ſet forth the ill conditions of the Oſtrich.</p>
                  <q>Her labour is in vain without fear.</q>
                  <p>As if it had been ſaid, Through her careleſsneſs, ſhe is in hazzard to loſe all that labour, which according to natures courſe ſhe had taken in laying her eggs. In this ſenſe, that promiſe is made to the Church (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.23.) <hi>They ſhall not labour in vain, nor bring forth in trouble, for they are the bleſſed of the Lord, and their off ſpring with them.</hi> As there of them in the Negative, ſo here 'tis ſaid of the Oſtrich in the affirmative, <hi>Her labour is in vain;</hi> that is, it is likely to be in vain, and all but loſt labour, as to her eggs and young ones.</p>
                  <p>Labour is in vain, when it turns to very ſmall account. A Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman that plows &amp; ſows his ground, if it ſcarce yield him his ſeed again, is ſaid to labour in vain, becauſe he hath got ſo little by his labour, though ſomewhat he hath got. A Student that hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied himſelf to his book, and gotten but little knowledge, may be ſaid to have ſtudied in vain; much more is that <hi>labour in vain,</hi> which turns to no account, or hath no good effect at all; ſuch as is the waſhing of the <hi>Ethiopian</hi> or Black-moo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, whom how long ſoever ye waſh, he is never a whit the whiter. But above all vain labour, that labour is in vain, which produceth an effect quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the intent and purpoſe of the labourer. Thus <hi>Pharoah</hi> and the <hi>Egyptians</hi> laboured in vain, to diminiſh the <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> for (ſaith the Scripture, <hi>Exod.</hi> 1.12.) <hi>the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew.</hi> Thus alſo the Heathen Emperors labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in vain to aboliſh Chriſtianity; for the more they perſecuted
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:48669:216"/> the Chriſtians, the more they were confirmed in the faith of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>The Oſtrich layeth eggs for the encreaſe of her kind; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if her eggs be broken, or the young ones trodden under foot as ſoon as hatcht, here's labour in vain in the ſecond ſenſe at leaſt, becauſe no good comes of her labour.</p>
                  <p>Yet I may ſay, the labour of the Oſtrich is here ſaid to be in vain, not becauſe ſhe hath no effect of her labour, nor becauſe the effect runs croſs to her intent, no, nor becauſe ſhe hath but little fruit of her labour, but ſhe is ſaid to labour in vain, becauſe if God did not take more care of her eggs and young ones than ſhe doth, her labour would be altogether in vain; for her labour is (as it followeth)
<q>Without fear.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>What fear? There is a twofold fear; Firſt, There is a fear puzling us with diſtraction and amazement. Secondly, a fear urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us to activity and induſtry. The Oſtriches labour is <hi>without fear,</hi> that is, without ſuch fear as ſhould put her upon indeavour to preſerve her own eggs and young ones; ſhe fears no evil that may come to them, and ſo takes no care what becomes of them; ſhe is a fearleſs creature of any danger, and ſo a careleſs crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as to the uſe of any means for the prevention of danger. The Oſtrich is not without all fear; for they that have had beſt knowledge of this animal, have found her ſo fearful a creature, that her fear, as well as her folly, is gone into a Proverb; a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fearful man being ſaid to be <hi>more fearful than an Oſtrich.</hi> The Oſtrich is here ſaid to be without fear, becauſe ſhe wants that provident fear which ſhould excite her to look after thoſe that are hers, as a parent doth or ought, after the good of thoſe that depend upon him. The Oſtrich hath no love for her young ones, &amp; therefore no fear about them. Though <hi>Aelian</hi> (as was toucht before) reports otherwiſe of her (<hi>lib.</hi> 14. <hi>cap.</hi> 7.) but in this he is alone, and may be ſuſpected as to the truth of this relation, as well as about the number of her eggs formerly mentioned, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in others contradict him; and therefore, if God took no more care than ſhe (as was ſaid) <hi>all her labour would be in vain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="412" facs="tcp:48669:217"/>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>We labour in vain to have, if we labour not to preſerve what we have.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>What is it to have eggs, if there be neglect of hatching them? what is it to have young ones, if there be a neglect of bringing them up?<note place="margin">Non minor eſt virtus quam quaerere parta tueri.</note> It is as great a vertue to preſerve what we have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by labour, as to labour for the attaining of it; and how much ſoever we labour for the attaining of any thing, unleſs we labour for the preſervation of it, both labours are in vain. All labour is in vain that is not followed with a due care for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of what we labour for.</p>
                  <p>Note, Secondly;
<q>A due fear puts us upon the uſe of means, for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our ſelves and our relations.</q>

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Res eſt ſolicitè plena timoris amor.</note>What's the reaſon why this Oſtrich takes no care to hatch her eggs, to preſerve her young ones? She is fearleſs; had ſhe a fear about them, ſhe would take care of them. As true <hi>love is full of ſolicitous fear,</hi> ſo due fear is full of ſolicitous endeavour. Fear makes us both conſultive what to do, and active in doing it. And as it makes us both conſultive and active about our outward preſervation, ſo much more for our inward and ſpiritual preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. It is ſaid of <hi>Noah (Heb.</hi> 11.7.) <hi>That being warned of God of things not ſeen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an Ark for the ſaving of his houſe. Noah</hi> had never taken care to prepare an Ark againſt the deluge, but for theſe gracious impreſſions of fear, that God would bring a dreadful inundation upon the world. Fear moved him, and faith prevailed with him to prepare an Ark. The Apoſtle (<hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13.) calls upon all believers <hi>to work out their ſalvation with fear and trembling.</hi> If we have no fear about our ſalvation, we ſhall never work out our ſalvation. Yet 'tis a truth, that they who have moſt aſſurance of their ſalvation, are moſt in working out their ſalvation. Holy aſſurance is ſo far from making us careleſs, that then we are moſt careful, knowing that the Lord hath joyned the end and means together; knowing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, That they <hi>are in moſt ſafety, who have moſt ſenſe of danger; yea, that they who have moſt fear of danger, are fartheſt from feeling danger.</hi> The labour of the Oſtrich is in vain, becauſe ſhe hath no
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:48669:217"/> fear; her fooliſhneſs makes her fearleſs, and that makes her careleſs; therefore no thanks to her, that all her labour is not loſt or in vain, that both her eggs and young ones do not utterly miſcarry. Thus we may profitably meditate upon the improvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of this creature the Oſtrich, and learn wiſdom from her folly, to make us more provident. But whence is it, or how comes it to paſs, that ſhe is ſo fooliſh? The next words tell us.</p>

                  <p>In this Verſe, a reaſon or an account is given of this blockiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, careleſsneſs and fearleſsneſs of the Oſtrich; it is, <hi>Becauſe God hath deprived her of wiſdom. More fooliſh than an Oſtrich,</hi> is a proverb for the greateſt fool. The Hebrew Text may be read thus; <hi>God hath made her to forget wiſdom.</hi> Now, as one may be ſaid to forget that which he hath not, ſo that which he never had. In the deſcription that <hi>Bildad</hi> gives of a wicked man (<hi>Chap.</hi> 8.13.) he ſaith, <hi>This is the portion of them that forget God;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Obliviſci ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis dicitur, cujus nullam nuquam ſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam aut noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam habuit. <hi>Druſ.</hi>
                     </note> And who are they? the words are a periphraſis of the wicked, <hi>To forget God</hi> is their character; they may be ſaid to forget God, who never had any true knowledge or remembrance of him. Thus (<hi>Gen.</hi> 41.30.) <hi>There ſhall ariſe after them</hi> (that is, <hi>after the ſeven years of plenty) ſeven years of famine, and all the plenty ſhall be forgotten to the Land of Egypt.</hi> In a time of famine, we are rather quickned to remember former years of plenty, together with the waſt that we then made of it, and our unthankfulneſs for it. When the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had nothing but <hi>Manna</hi> in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, they complained (<hi>Num.</hi> 11.5.) <hi>We remember the fiſh which we did eat in</hi> Egypt <hi>freely, the cucumbers, and melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlick.</hi> Now, when 'tis ſaid, that in the ſeven years of famine, they ſhould forget the ſeven years of plenty, the meaning is, they ſhould have no plenty at all; the forgetting of it was not the not having of plenty in their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories, but the not having it in their hands. When a people are in a time of trouble, they remember their former peace; and when in ſtraights, they remember their former liberty; but they are ſaid in ſtraights, and trouble, and famine, not to remember their liberties, peace and plenty, becauſe they have none of them. Thus here <hi>God hath made her to forget wiſdom,</hi> that is, ſhe hath
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:48669:218"/> no wiſdom, nor knowledge, nor underſtanding; and when it is ſaid, according to our tranſlation, <hi>God hath deprived her of wiſdom,</hi> we are not to take it, as if God had taken that ſtock of wiſdom from her which once ſhe had; but his depriving her of wiſdom, is his not communicating wiſdom <hi>to her,</hi> or his not truſting her with a ſtock of wiſdom; For ſo it followeth,
<q>Neither hath he imparted to her underſtanding.</q>

                     </note>This latter part of the <hi>verſe</hi> explaines the former, and ſhews that the Oſtriches want of wiſdom is noc privative, but negative; God hath not taken it from her, but not given it her. But here it may be demanded, hath God given wiſdom, or imparted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding to any fowls of the air? Are not theſe two words, <hi>wiſdom and underſtanding,</hi> too high for beaſts or birds, indeed, for the whole irrational part of the creation? I anſwer, as the Oſtrich hath no true wiſdom nor underſtanding, ſo neither hath any beaſt or bird. Wiſdom and underſtanding taken ſtrictly, are proper only to rational creatures, Men and Angels; there is no wiſdom where there is no reaſon: yet wiſdom and underſtanding are aſcribed ſometimes to brutiſh creatures, and here the Oſtrich, a brutiſh creature, is ſaid to be deprived of them, or not to have them communicated to her, becauſe not ſo much as that ſhaddow of wiſdom and underſtanding is given to her, which appears in ſome beaſts and birds. Brutes are ſaid to have wiſdom, becauſe they have that which ſerves their turn for their preſervation; and ſome of them are ſaid to have wiſdom, becauſe they are indeed wiſer, and more ſubtil than other brutes (<hi>Gen.</hi> 3.1.) yet all their wiſdom is nothing to the wiſdom of man. That natural affection and forecaſt of beaſts and birds, in providing for, and bringing up their young ones, is their wiſdom; of this wiſdom God hath deprived the Oſtrich, <hi>neither hath he imparted</hi> unto her ſo much as this ſmall parcel of underſtanding, not ſo much as this ſhaddow of underſtanding, which he hath beſtowed upon other, both birds and beaſts. And there appears ſomewhat in nature, as a proof, that the Oſtrich is a fooliſh bird, for her head is very little, and her brains (in proportion) much leſs. And that any one Oſtrich hath not much brains, may be collected from a piece of the <hi>Romane</hi> Hiſtory, which reports, that <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> the Emperour had the heads of ſix hundred Oſtriches prepared for
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:48669:218"/> him at one ſupper, only for the brains ſake. 'Tis added alſo by the ſame Authour, that the Oſtrich is naturally deaf,<note place="margin">Bochartus.</note> and that there is no perfect anima elſe, in the whole compaſs of nature, that is deaf or wants the ſenſe of hearing. And needs muſt that creature have little or no underſtanding, which hath no hearing, that being the ſenſe of diſcipline. All theſe conſiderations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm what this Text in <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks of her, that <hi>God hath not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted to her underſtanding.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence Note, Firſt;
<q>
                        <hi>Some beaſts of the earth, and birds of the air, have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what that may be called wiſdom,</hi> ſo much at leaſt as ſerves their turn, and directs them to do what is beſt for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and theirs.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though the Oſtrich is ſhort of this ſhort pittance of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, yet moſt irrational creatures have it.</p>
                  <p>Note, Secondly;
<q>Whatever looks like wiſdom and underſtanding, in a brute crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, beaſt or bird, is the gift of God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>God is ſaid not to give or impart wiſdom an underſtanding to this brute creature, therefore he gives it others. Wiſdom, ſuch as it is, in beaſts and birds, muſt be acknowledged to be a gift of God. Not only every good gift in man, but every good gift in beaſts, their ſtrength, their ſwiftneſs, their ſubtilty, and craft their fore-caſt, are of the Lords plantation in them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Note:
<q>God hath not given a like portion or meaſure of wiſdom and underſtanding to all brute creatures.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some have (in their capacity) a great deal, others very little, ſo little, that they may be ſaid to have none at all, as the Oſtrich in the Text; who (though in ſome things ſhe hath underſtanding, yet) as to her eggs and young ones, is a careleſs, witleſs animal, As there is a difference among men in wiſdom and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ſome have a great portion given them of God, others have ſo little, that they may be ſaid to have none: The natural man hath no ſpiritual underſtanding (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.11.) <hi>This is a people of no underſtanding; therefore he that made them, will not have
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:48669:219"/> vercy upon them; and he that formed them, will ſhew them no fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.</hi> What! were they brutes and beaſts? no, poſſibly they were witty and ſubtle enough for the world, but they were a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of no ſpiritual underſtanding. Men full of natural under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding may have none that is ſpiritual. And As to natural and political wiſdom and underſtanding, there is a great difference among men: Some have enough to rule Kingdoms, others, not enough to govern a family, no, nor their perſonal affairs; yea, ſome men are ſo low in parts and underſtanding, that God may be ſaid to have deprived them of underſtanding, or not to have impart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wiſdom to them. And this offers us a ground of uſeful me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation. Let us bleſs God, that men have more wiſdom than brutes; and if any man have more wiſdom and underſtanding than his neighbour, let him acknowledge the goodneſs and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of God to him in it; for who hath made thee to differ in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural wiſdom and underſtanding? As the Apoſtle ſpeaks of that great difference among men, grace and no grace, <hi>Who hath made thee to differ?</hi> how is it that one man hath grace, and an other hath no grace? hath man made himſelf to differ in grace? No, it is of grace that any have grace: So who hath made thee to differ in common wiſdom and underſtanding? what, thy ſelf? ſurely no. You that ſeem to have as much wiſdom above other men, as men have above beaſts, have not any of your ſelves; it is God who makes all men differ from beaſts in underſtanding, and it is he that makes one man differ, from another in underſtanding. He that hath almoſt as much underſtanding above other men, as men have commonly above beaſts hath it all of God. Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is not of nature, nor is it gotten (though it may be impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) by ſtudy and induſtry; gold and ſilver cannot purchaſe it, nor can our pains procure it. What man receives not, he hath not; nor hath any man more than he hath received. Now if common wiſdom be of God, and we owe him the glory of it; how much more is ſpirirual wiſdom, <hi>which is to fear him,</hi> and ſpiritual un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, <hi>which is to depart from evil (Job</hi> 28. <hi>ult.</hi>) the gift of God!</p>
                  <p>What a mercy is it to have wiſdom,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To know God in Chriſt, whom to know is eternal life.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, To know our ſelves loſt, miſerable and undone for ever without Chriſt.</p>
                  <pb n="417" facs="tcp:48669:219"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, To know the difference between good and evil, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween light and darkneſs, truth and error, ſound doctrine and damnable, right worſhip and ſuperſtitious or idolatrous.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, To know our duty, what is incumbent upon us in this life. <hi>The wiſdom of the prudent is to underſtand his way (Pro.</hi> 14.8.) where to walk, what to do, that he may keep tite and cloſe to God, to know upon what bottom he is ſettled, and upon what ground he treads.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, What a mercy is it for us, that live here on earth, to ſee our way to that eternal life in heaven!</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, What wiſdom and underſtanding hath God imparted to his people, and how thankful ſhould they be for it, that they are able, while on earth, to converſe and have communion with himſelf in heaven! The Apoſtle ſaith (<hi>Phil.</hi> 3.20.) <hi>Our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation is in heaven;</hi> with whom there? with God. True be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers know how to converſe with God, and can ſay (in their meaſure, as the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> 1 <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.3.) <hi>Truly our fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is with the Father, and his Son Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> This wiſdom hath God imparted to his faithful ſervants, and how thankful ſhould they be for it! The leaſt ray of wiſdom is from him; that in beaſts, and that in common men, much more that in godly men. The wiſeſt in the world would have had no more wiſdom than an Oſtrich, had not God provided better for them, and given them a richer furniture of internals or intellectuals.</p>
                  <p>Further, conſider this Oſtrich as a goodly bird, having beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful feathers, yet not a dram of wiſdom or underſtanding.</p>
                  <p>Hence Note, Fourthly;
<q>Many creatures have a bodily beauty and ſtrength, yet little wit and underſtanding.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Oſtrich hath a bulky ſtrong body, as well as beautiful fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; but her brains are as light as her feathers. And is it not ſo with ſome men? their gay feathers are viſible; but where is their underſtanding?</p>
                  <p>Note, Laſtly;
<q>The ſame creature way want wiſdom in one point, yet have it in another.</q>

'Tis ſo likewiſe among men; ſome are wiſe enough in this or that matter, while miſerably blockiſh and defective in all things elſe.

                  </p>
                  <p>As much as to ſay, ſhe can out-run them all, and ſo cares not a ſtraw for them, let them do their worſt; ſhe ſcorns them, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe able to reſiſt them, or as if ſhe thought her ſelf ſtronger than they, but becauſe by help of her wings, though on her feet, ſhe is ſwifter than they. So that, in plain courſe they can never over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take her, and therefore not take her; only by ſome ſlights and ſtratagems, ſhe is intangled and taken; ſhe may be over-reacht, but ſhe cannot be over-run. And ſo ſwift is her courſe, that is hath long ſince grown into a Proverb among the <hi>Arabians,</hi> who thus ſignifie a man of great expedition in buſineſs, <hi>He hath ridden upon the wings of the Oſtrich. What time ſhe lifteth up her ſelf on high, ſhe ſcorneth the Horſe and his Rider.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence Note, Firſt;
<q>Dangers put all creatures to their utmoſt ſhifts.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Oſtrich being heavy bodied, hath no great mind to run, and being ſhort or weak-winged, hath little power to fly, yet when ſhe muſt, ſhe runs to purpoſe; ſhe will not loſe her life to ſpare her labour. Great dangers make us do great thing. Fear adds wings to our feet, and makes a heavy body mount and fly, rather than go. The Oſtrich (in that caſe) <hi>lifteth up her ſelf on high.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note, Secondly;
<q>Nature teacheth us to ſeek our ſafety above, <hi>or on high.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though the Oſtrich cannot ſore aloft, in the air as the Eagle, yet ſhe lifts up her ſelf as high as ſhe can above the earth. Some ſeek for ſafety by creeping into the ground, and running into the holes of the earth (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.19. <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.16.) But the beſt way for our ſafety, when we are purſued, is by lifting up our ſelves on high, and that to God; to get into his power, and mercy, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; that's our way, and that's our wiſdom, when we are hunted and purſued by our enemies. <hi>I</hi> (ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 121.1.) <hi>will lift up mine eyes to the hills, from whence cometh my help;</hi> that is, to God (<hi>ver.</hi> 2.) When the Oſtrich is thus lifted up <hi>ſhe ſcorneth the Horſe and his Rider.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="420" facs="tcp:48669:221"/>
                  <p>Hence Note;
<q>They who think they are out of danger, deſpiſe danger.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Oſtrich looks upon her ſelf as out of danger, when ſhe is on high, and therefore ſcorns the Horſe and his Rider. Danger is not to be laughed at, when we are under or within the reach of it; but we may laugh at it when we are out of the fear of it (<hi>Job</hi> 5.22.) <hi>At deſtruction and famine thou ſhalt laugh.</hi> Why? becauſe through the goodneſs of God thou ſhalt be provided againſt them, and prepared for them. A believer ſcorns the Horſe and his Rider, his ſwifteſt and moſt eager purſuers, becauſe he can lift up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on high, or as the Prophet ſpeaks (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.16.) <hi>He dwels on high, his place of defence is the munition of rocks, bread ſhall be given him, his waters ſhall be ſure;</hi> he is ſafe from danger, and out of gun-ſhot: This makes him laugh at danger, at trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and the ſword. God who ſitteth in heaven laughs at his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and hath them in diriſion (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.4.) why? becauſe he knows, they who oppoſe him, can do nothing to annoy him; they cannot ruin his kingdom, nor hurt his ſervants, how much ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they moleſt them; he ſits on high, he is above all his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. And as God lifted up in himſelf, ſo a godly man, lifted up on high in God, upon the wings of faith and love, ſcorns the Horſe and his Rider: For as the Apoſtle was (<hi>Rom.</hi> 8.38, 39.) ſo he is <hi>perſwaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor pri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>cipalities, nor powers, nor things preſent, nor things to come, nor heighth, nor, depth, nor any other creature ſhall be able to ſeparate him from the love of God, which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord;</hi> that is, they ſhall not be able to ſeparate him, either from that love that Chriſt bears to him, nor draw him off from that love which he bears to Chriſt. When once his ſoul is drawn up to a due height in believing, he ſcorns all dangers, and in all theſe things is more than a conqueror. A man that is a conqueror, much more he that is more than a conqueror, may ſcorn all dangers, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer them who think they have more than conquered him. From this whole <hi>verſe</hi> take theſe brief inferences.</p>
                  <p>Firſt,
<q>That which will not ſerve all turns, may yet ſerve many turns.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>We might chink the wings of the Oſtrich were given her to
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:48669:221"/> no purpoſe, becauſe he cannot fly aloft, nor make a lofty ſlight;<note place="margin">Pennae ſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thionis curren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Secondly,
<q>That which is very beautiful may not be very uſeful.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Oſtrich hath more beautiful wings than the Eagle, yet makes little uſe of them. We may in appearance be fit to do that which we cannot do.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,
<q>
                        <hi>God doth not uſually give all to one:</hi> He beſtows one thing upon this creatures, and that upon another.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Oſtrich hath goodly feathers, yet bad wings; the Eagle hath no goodly feathers, yet good wings. One man exceſs in this gift, another in that, ſcarce any one hath all (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.8, 9, 10.) All have not the ſame gift, and none have all gifts, that all may be kept in dependance upon God, and be humble one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards another, ſeeing they muſt be beholding one to another. All men cannot do all things; And though all godly men <hi>can do all things</hi> (which are commanded of God as their duty) through Chriſt ſtrengthning of them; yet ſome godly men cannot do ſome things, which others can.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, That which is conceived, and may well be the deſign of God in queſtioning <hi>Job</hi> about this creature, was to teach him, and us in him, the wiſdom of God towards unwiſe creatures, and the power of God in ſaving thoſe that are expoſed to danger; and ſo to quiet both <hi>Jobs</hi> ſpirit and ours in ſtaying upon his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, when we are in greateſt ſtraights. What though we have not Eagles wings; yet between wings and feet we ſhall make a ſhift to ſhuffle out of danger; and if we cannot out-fly, yet we may out-run the Horſe and his Rider.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, His courage appears, as by ſlighting danger, ſo by that which is a conſequent of it, his forwardneſs to run upon dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; for ſo doth he, that <hi>goeth out to meet the armed men,</hi> or ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of men, ver. 21. and <hi>turneth not away</hi> (as he doth not) <hi>from the ſword,</hi> ver. 22.

It is not any kind of ſtrength which is here intended, but an <hi>active ſtrength;</hi> I may ſay, <hi>a manly ſtrength.</hi> Hiſtories report ſtrange things concerning the manly ſtrength of the Horſe; his is a generous ſtrength. <hi>Alexanders</hi> horſe, called <hi>Bucephalus,</hi> is fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for the greatneſs, both of his ſtrength and ſpirit. <hi>Haſt thou given the Horſe ſtrength?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note, Firſt;
<q>The ſtrength even of a horſe, is the gift of God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>God is infinitely ſtrong and mighty; and whatſoever might or ſtrength is found in any creature, God is the Author of it: Strength in great proportion, is not the portion of every creature. <hi>Solomon (Prov.</hi> 30.26.) ſpeaks of the Coneys as a feeble folk, they have little or no ſtrength; yet that they have little ſtrength, or that little ſtrength which they have is of God, as well as that the Horſe hath great ſtrength, or the great ſtrength of the horſe: The ſtrength of a beaſt is of God, as well as the ſtrength of man. The ſtrength of mans body is of God, as well as that more excellent ſtrength, the ſtrength of his mind, or the ſtrength of his underſtanding, judgement and memory. All ſtrength flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from, and is to be aſcribed unto <hi>the ſtrong God.</hi> As no man gives it, ſo let no man take it to himſelf. Glory not in ſtrength; give God the glory of all ſtrength, even of the Horſes ſtrength.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, A Horſe having received ſuch mighty ſtrength, yet is ſerviceable to man, for very many, and very neceſſary uſes, as was toucht before, not only for pleaſure, for hunting and racing, but for burden and for travel, for draught and for war.</p>
                  <pb n="425" facs="tcp:48669:223"/>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>The power and goodneſs of God is much ſeen, and much to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, in making a creature ſo ſtrong, yet ſubject to, and uſeful for man.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some creatures have great ſtrength, yet are no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, nor will be ſubject nor ſerviceable to man. It is ſaid at the 10. verſe of this Chapter, concerning the Unicorn, <hi>Canſt thou bind the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nicorn with his band in the furrow? or will he harrow the valleys after thee?</hi> The Unicorn hath great ſtrength, but man can get no ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice from him; he cannot bind him in the furrow, nor make him do him any other work. Why is it that the Horſe, who is of great ſtrength, though poſſibly not of ſo great ſtrength as the Unicorn, is ſo ſerviceable? ſurely the reaſon is only this, Becauſe God by his power hath ſubdued the ſtrength of the Horſe to, and for the ſervice of man. Who could break the Horſe, who could handle and manage him, if God himſelf had not brought him to hand? The Elephant, greater in ſtrength than the Horſe or Unicorn, is yet made ſubject to the uſe of man, by the power and appointment of God. Take five Inferences from both theſe conſiderations: That the ſtrength of the Horſe, is of God; and that the Horſe, though mighty in ſtrength, is by God ſubdued to the uſe of man.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, If the ſtrength of horſes be the gift of God, then, do not glory in their ſtrength; though they are very ſtrong, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce not in their ſtrength, but in God, who hath given them their ſtrength. <hi>David</hi> ſaith (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.10.) <hi>The Lord delights not in the ſtrength of the Horſe.</hi> The Lord gives the Horſe ſtrength, but he delights not in it; <hi>no, nor in the legs of a man; The Lords delight is in them that fear him.</hi> The Lord tells us, he doth not delight in them, to teach us, that we ſhould not delight in them. The Lord delights not in the ſtrength of a horſe, much leſs in the ſtrength of thoſe men, who are like Horſes and Mules (of whom <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.9.) <hi>whoſe mouth muſt be held in with bit and bridle, leſt they come neer unto us, to do us a miſchief.</hi> Some men are ſtrong in body, and ſtrong in mind too; they have ſtrong un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings, and ſtrong memories; yet a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e but like ſtrong horſes, that muſt be held in with bit and bridle, elſe they will do more miſchief with their ſtrength, than the ſtrongeſt ungoverned horſes.
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:48669:224"/> In theſe the Lord delights not; he cannot delight in the ſtrength of any who are ſtrong to ſin, and to do wickedly; or (to give it in the words of the Prophet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.22.) <hi>Who are ſtrong to drink wine, and to mingle ſtrong drink:</hi> ſuch a ſtrength ſome men glory in, but the Lord abhors all that ſtrength which is uſed and iſſued to the darkning of his glory.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As we are not to delight in the ſtrength of horſes, but in God, who hath given them their ſtrength; ſo, whatever ſtrength we ſee in the horſe, or in any other creature, we ſhould give God the glory of it. Do not glory in the ſtrength of creatures, but in God, who gives them their ſtrength; that which he hath given, or cometh from him, ſhould return unto him in daily praiſe, or in the due acknowledgement of his power and goodneſs.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe the ſtrength of horſes</hi> (I ſay alſo, your own ſtrength) <hi>for God, and not againſt him.</hi> We ſhould take heed of imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſtrength which God hath given a beaſt, againſt God; much more ſhould we take heed of uſing our own ſtrength againſt him. When men imploy the ſtrength of a beaſt, or their own, againſt God, they imploy the gift againſt the giver, and ſo fight againſt God with his own weapons.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, If the ſtrength of horſes be of God, or be his gift, <hi>Then truſt not in the ſtrength of horſes:</hi> Uſe the ſtrength of horſes, but do not truſt the ſtrength of horſes. If you truſt that ſtrength which God hath given to horſes, you make them your God. How often doth God fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And when the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>A horſe is a vain thing,</hi> he doth not mean it of a weak horſe, but of (ſuch a horſe as is here deſcribed) a horſe of the grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>eſt ſtrength imaginable, ſuch a horſe is a vain thing to ſave a man, neither can he deliver any by his ſtrength; and therefore the Lord, when he promiſed great deliverances to his people (leſt they ſhould expect it by the ſtrength of horſes) faith (<hi>Hoſ.</hi> 1.7.) <hi>I will ſave them by the Lord their God, and will not ſave them by bow, nor by ſword, nor by battel, by horſes, nor by horſe-men:</hi> As if he had told them, do not look after creature ſtrength to be ſaved by; a horſe will be a vain thing to ſave you,
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:48669:224"/> and I can ſave you effectually without horſes; yea, I will. Hence the people of God (<hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.3.) when beaten off from all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward helps and truſts, are brought in, ſpeaking thus; <hi>Aſhur ſhall not ſave us; we will not ride upon horſes, neither will we ſay any more to the work of our hands, ye are our gods:</hi> Heretofore we thought to be ſaved by this and that, we thought, if we could have horſes enough they would ſave us; but now, <hi>Aſhur ſhall not ſave us, nor will we ride upon horſes.</hi> We may collect from (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 20.7.) how the ſpirit of man runs out this way; <hi>Some truſt in chariots, and ſome in horſes; but we will remember the name of the Lord our God.</hi> The Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> gave great caution a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this thing, limitting even the King in this caſe; and that Law was made for the King ſome hundred of years before they had a King (<hi>Deut.</hi> 17.16.) <hi>He ſhall not multiply horſes to h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>m<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, nor cauſe the people to return to Egypt, to the end that he ſhould multiply horſes:</hi> As if it had been ſaid, take heed you do not put your confidence upon the ſtrength of horſes; though the Law deny not your King the uſe of horſes, both for civil and military affairs, yet it limits him that he ſhall not multiply them, leſt, having many of them, he ſhould look upon them, as more than they are, or can be, his help, and ſo put confidence in them. Hence alſo is that reproof (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 31.1.) <hi>Woe to them that go down to</hi> Egypt <hi>for help, and ſtay on horſes, and truſt in chariots, becauſe they are many, and in horſe-men, becauſe they are very ſtrong.</hi> We ſee how the ſpirit of man runs out to the horſe which God hath made ſtrong, even forgetting God who hath made him ſtrong. That people thought themſelves ſtrong enough with horſes without the ſtrong God, and therefore the Lord told them at the third verſe, <hi>The Egyptians are men, and not God, and their horſes are fleſh, and not ſpirit;</hi> that is, they are weak and not ſtrong: not that they were weak in themſelves, but weak to ſave and deliver them, or to give them victory in battel; they are but fleſh, and not ſpirit: fleſh notes weakneſs, and ſpirit notes ſtrength; ſo that, though a horſe hath a mighty ſtrength, yet if you truſt to him, he is but fleſh, that is, he is weak. And ſome conceive this was the reaſon why the Lord commanded <hi>Joſhua,</hi> in his war with the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanites,</hi> to hough their horſes; as the rule is given (<hi>Joſh.</hi> 11.6.) <hi>Thou ſhalt hough their horſes, and burn their chariots with fire;</hi> that is, cut their nerves, or as we ſay, their ham-ſtrings. Why
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:48669:225"/> did the Lord command him to hough their horſes? why might he not preſerve them for ſervice in his wars? Doubtleſs it was, leſt he ſhould think that horſes could do the work. And therefore according to this command of God, when <hi>David took a thouſand chariots, and ſeven hundred horſe-men from the</hi> Moabites, <hi>he houghed all the chariot-horſes, but reſerved of them for an hundred chariots</hi> (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.4.) He would not multiply horſes to himſelf out of the ſpoyls of the enemy, leſt he ſhould ſeem to truſt their ſtrength and numbers.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>Fear not the ſtrength of horſes.</hi> The Prophet ſaith to the fearful (<hi>Jer.</hi> 12.5.) <hi>If thou haſt run with foot-men, and they have wearied thee, how canſt thou contend with horſes?</hi> When we have horſes to contend with, 'tis a very dangerous conflict. The Prophet by <hi>foot-men</hi> and <hi>horſe-men,</hi> intends leſſer and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter oppoſitions; when we have to deal with leſſer difficulties, we have to deal with <hi>foot-men,</hi> but when with greater, then with <hi>horſe-men.</hi> If then you have to do with horſes, either in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor or in plain ſenſe, <hi>fear them not;</hi> why? for they are but creatures; and God who hath given them their ſtrength, can take away their ſtrength, and make them uſeleſs (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 76.6.) <hi>At thy rebuke, O God of</hi> Jacob, <hi>both the chariot and the horſe are caſt into a deep ſleep.</hi> Suppoſe a multitude of chariots and horſes ſhould come againſt us, yet at the Lords rebuke, if he doth but ſpeak the word, if the God of <hi>Jacob</hi> do but give a rebuke, the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots and horſes are laid in a deep ſleep; that is, they are as nothing or as dead. Death is a deep ſleep; &amp; therefore, though horſes have a mighty ſtrength, yet be no more afraid of them than of that which is dead; the Lord God who hath given them their ſtrength, can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend us againſt their ſtrength, or diſable them, notwithſtanding their ſtrength, to offend us. <hi>Haſt thou given the Horſe ſtrength?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>Haſt thou cloathed his neck with thunder?</q>
                  <p>To cloath with, or to be cloathed with this or that, is a very common Scriptural phraſe, metaphorically applyed to things, both corporeal and incorporeal. Of the firſt ſort are all thoſe places of Scripture, where man is ſaid <hi>to be cloathed with skin and fleſh (Job</hi> 10.11.) <hi>The fleſh with worms and clods of duſt. (Job</hi> 7.5.) <hi>The fields with flocks (Pſal.</hi> 65.13.) <hi>The earth with Sea (Pſal.</hi> 104.6.) <hi>The Sea with clouds (Job</hi> 38.9.) <hi>The heavens with
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:48669:225"/> blackneſs (Iſa.</hi> 50.3.) Of the ſecond ſort, are all thoſe Scriptures which ſay, <hi>A perſon is cloathed with righteouſneſs (Job</hi> 39.14. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 132.9.) <hi>With ſalvation (Pſal.</hi> 132.16.) <hi>With glory and beauty (Job</hi> 40.10.) <hi>With power or ſtrength (Pſal.</hi> 93.1. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 51.9.) <hi>With the Spirit of God (Judg.</hi> 6.34. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24.20.) <hi>With deſolation (Ezek.</hi> 7.27.) <hi>With ſhame (Pſal.</hi> 71.13. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 109.29.) And as both things and perſons are ſaid to be cloathed with theſe, ſo to be cloathed with any thing, notes two things; either, Firſt, that ſuch have much of it. Thus to be cloathed with glory, is to be exceeding glorious; and to be cloathed with ſhame, is to be exceedingly aſhamed; and to be cloathed with pride, is to be exceeding proud; and to be cloathed with righteouſneſs and honour, is to be exceeding righteous and honourable; and to be cloathed with humility, is to be exceeding humble; and laſtly, to be cloathed with the Spirit, is to be exceeding ſpiritual, and full of the Spirit. Or, Secondly, to be cloathed with any thing that is good, notes it to be very becoming and ornamental to us, as rich and ſutable garments are; or if it be bad, that it is very diſgrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and detrimental to us, as filthy and uncomely garments are. Now, here in the Text, when the neck of the horſe is ſaid to be cloathed with thunder, it muſt needs note ſomewhat, in which the horſe exceeds, and which is both an honour and an ornament to the horſe. <hi>Haſt thou</hi> (ſaith God to <hi>Job,</hi> or I) <hi>cloathed his neck with thunder?</hi>

                  <p>There are various interpretations of the word which we here tranſlate <hi>thunder.</hi>

The only anſwer is, that it is to be reckoned among thoſe words (of which there are ſeveral in Scripture) which are only once read or uſed; and ſo the ſenſe of them is to be given from the ſcope of the place where they are uſed, not from their uſage in other places, they not being uſed in any place but one. This is a fair interpretation, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing granted, that the word <hi>Ragnemah</hi> hath no communion with the word <hi>Ragnam,</hi> which properly ſignifies <hi>Thunder.</hi>
                  </p>

But ſurely, the word <hi>thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> ſutes not with ſuch ſounds; Thunder muſt needs relate to ſomewhat that is terrible, not ornamental; and all the ſound which the rattling of a Horſes armes or ornaments can make, is much too low for any reſemblance of thunder, or to be compared with it; nor will the general ſcope of the queſtion comply with any ſuch interpretation. For when God ſaith, to <hi>Job, Haſt thou

And the Lord poſſibly put this queſtion, in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all ſuch kind of defences and ornaments; As if he had ſaid, <hi>Thou; O Job, haſt or mayſt cloath the neck of the horſe with rich or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments, and ſtrong armes to defend him? but haſt thou, or canſt thou cloath his neck with thunder?

                     </gap>ged, we may ſay, ſparks leap out of his eyes like lightning, and a ſound out of his mouth like thunder, aad a breath out of his noſtrils like ſmoke. And that the ſnorting and neighing of Horſes is dreadful, even like thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, appears fully by that of the Prophet (<hi>Jer.</hi> 8.16.) <hi>The ſnorting of his Horſes was heard from Dan</hi> (that is, from the utmoſt bounds of the Country) <hi>the whole Land trembled at the ſound of the neighing of his ſtrong ones.</hi> The neighing of Horſes, is a ſign of their courage and boldneſs, of their fearleſneſs and generoſity; which probably was the reaſon why the great Lords of <hi>Perſia</hi> agreed, that meeting all together in one place on Horſe-back, he ſhould be choſen Emperor whoſe Horſe neighed firſt after they were met; they ſuppoſing it a good Omen or Sign, that the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der would prove a perſon of great courage and ſpirit, whoſe Horſe firſt gave that token of it: Upon what occaſion the Horſe of <hi>Darius</hi> neighed firſt, and ſo got his Maſter the Empire, the <hi>Perſian</hi> hiſtories will inform the Reader.</p>
                  <p>But to the point in hand. 'Tis evident from what hath
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:48669:228"/> been ſaid, that 'tis no uncouth, nor far fetcht, much leſs forced metaphor, to expreſs the neighing of a furious fretting Horſe by thundering. And as the word rendred thunder, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies (in the Verbe) to be moved with choler and indignation, ſo a noble-ſpirited Horſe, charging an enemy, ſhews a high ſtrain of rage and indignation, in which reſpect, together with his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, his neck may ſeem to be <hi>cloathed with thunder.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And though it be ſaid, that, as the neck is not reckoned among the inſtruments of ſpeaking in man, ſo it cannot be conveniently reckoned among the inſtruments of neighing in a Horſe, that properly belonging to the throat; and though I grant that when the Scripture ſaith (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 75.5.) <hi>Speak not with a ſtiff neck;</hi> the word <hi>neck</hi> is not there to be taken, for the means or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of ſpeech, but notes only the manner of ſpeaking; namely, that there the Lord forbids wicked men to ſpeak ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, pertinaciouſly, or as <hi>Hannah</hi> expreſſeth it in her Song (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.3.) that they ſhould <hi>talk no more ſo exceeding proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, nor let arrogancy come out of their mouth:</hi> Yet the throat being placed in and being a part of the neck, we may by a common ſynec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doche, of the whole for the part, avoid that difficulty. Nor doth the metaphor of <hi>cloathing</hi> (though, I confeſs it, moſt ſutable to the firſt interpretation, that of the <hi>mane</hi>) oppoſe this third of <hi>neighing;</hi> For when a Horſe neighs ſtrongly, the ſound coming out of his mouth compaſſeth him, his neck eſpecially, round about as with a garment. <hi>David</hi> deſcribing a wicked man, ſaith, <hi>he cloathed himſelf with curſing (Pſal.</hi> 109.18.) Curſing goes out of the mouth of a wicked man, as neighing out of the mouth of a Horſe; and therefore, as when a man is much in curſing, he may be ſaid to cloath himſelf with curſing, as with a garment, ſo a Horſe which neigheth much, may (I conceive) be ſaid to have his neck cloathed with neighing.</p>
                  <p>Having thus far drawn out theſe expoſitions of this ſecond queſtion, which the Lord put to <hi>Job</hi> about the Horſe, <hi>Haſt thou cloathed his neck with thunder?</hi> I ſhall ſubmit them to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders judgment, and only ſay, that the firſt (if that word <hi>Ragne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mah</hi> may ſignifie a Horſes-mane) is the cleareſt, and moſt literal of them all; and that among the ſecond ſort of expoſitions, the third is moſt received and approved.</p>
                  <p>From the firſt interpretation we learn,
<q>
                        <pb n="434" facs="tcp:48669:229"/>God hath beſtowed not only ſtrength, but ornaments upon the Horſe.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The mane of a Horſe is of little uſe (and therefore ſome cut it quite off) but it is a great ornament to the Horſe.</p>
                  <p>From the two laſt interpretations</p>
                  <p>Obſerve, Firſt;
<q>The Horſe in his heat and rage is very terrible.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thunder is ſo, and ſo muſt he needs be, whoſe neck is cloathed with any thing reſembling thunder.</p>

<q>It is of God that the Horſe is terrible.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Horſe hath thunder about his neck, but it is God who hath cloathed his neck with it. If any Horſe, or any other creature be delightful to us, God hath made it ſo; and if any Horſe, or any other creature be thunder, dreadful and terrible to us, it is the Lord who hath made it ſo. This we find more clearly held out in the next <hi>verſe.</hi>

<pb n="435" facs="tcp:48669:229"/> ſort of them, to make a ſound with their feet when they run. And if it ſhould be granted that great and generous horſes have ſomewhat peculiar in this, and make a greater ſound than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon horſes in running, yet to take the compariſon from the ſound which Graſs-hoppers make in flying, doth eaſily refute this expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. We know indeed, what <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith, <hi>Graſs-hoppers make ſuch a ſound with their wings in flying,</hi>

                     <hi>that they may be thought ſome other kind of fowls:</hi> Yet we cannot therefore believe, that it is a proper ſimilitude, to compare the ſound which horſes make in running (who, as Poets uſe to phraſe it, make the earth trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and groan) with that craſſing noiſe which Graſs-hoppers make while they fly in the air. For if the compariſon may at all be taken from flying-fowls, great fowls were much fitter for it, who uſe to fly in flocks together; Yet theſe greater fowls make no very great noiſe in flying, much leſs can Graſs-hoppers. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Poets, both Greek and Latine, though they affect to ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow great ſounds and clamours, by a ſimilitude taken from flying-fowls, yet they do not take the reſemblance from the ſound which their flying makes with their wings, but from the ſound or chattering which they make with their bills while they fly;<note place="margin">

                  <p>Seeing then fowls do not make any ſuch noiſe in flying, as may ſerve for a ſutable reſemblance of any great ſound, ſurely that ſmall noiſe which Graſs-hoppers make in flying cannot be a proper reſemblance of it. Further, here is nothing ſaid of many, or of a troop and body of horſes, but of a ſingle horſe, or of horſes ſingly and a part conſidered. Now that ſome one horſe ſhould be compared with one Graſs-hopper, as to the ſound which the one and the other makes in their motion, were no ſmall abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity.</p>
                  <p>This therefore may ſuffice for the laying aſide of that firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of the whole clauſe, though the force of the word doth not oppoſe it.</p>

                  <p>The motion of a horſe may be compared to that of a Graſs-hopper in two reſpects. Firſt, In reſpect of his ſwiftneſs. Secondly, Of his ſubſaltation, or bounding and leaping. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive God had reſpect only to the latter, in theſe words: for ſeeing this whole context doth not handle the nature of the horſe in general, but only the marks or qualities of valiant horſes; therefore the mention of this (namely, the ſubſaltation of horſes) is much more proper than that of their ſwiftneſs or ſpeed in run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: For ſwiftneſs or ſpeed in running, is not appropriate or peculiar to generous horſes; it being certain, that as they excel the common ſort of horſes, both in the ſwiftneſs of their courſe, and in the continuance or laſtingneſs of it, ſo it is as apparent, that ordinary horſes will often run very ſwiftly, or with great ſpeed for a time. But as for that other motion of their bodies in which they imitate the leaping or skipping of Graſs-hoppers, that is proper to them.</p>
                  <p>And there are two ſorts of this motion proper to generous horſes.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Bootius</hi> ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mad. ſacrae.</note> The one, in which ſtanding upon two feet only, either the hinder or the forefeet, the other part of their body is lifted up on high from the ground; which motion (being very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to the Rider) we call <hi>bounding</hi> or <hi>to bound.</hi> The other ſort of ſaltatory motion, is that, whereby the horſe lifts up himſelf, with his four feet quite off the ground, and goeth as it were leaping, or intermingles ſaltation or leaping with his going. There is a twofold leaping. Firſt, When a horſe raiſeth himſelf over a bar, hedge or ditch, this is of daily uſe. The other, is only for pompe, when a horſe raiſeth his body upon plain ground to ſhew his activity, this we call <hi>curveting,</hi> as the proud ſtately gate of a horſe is by us called <hi>praunſing.</hi> Now of theſe two motions, <hi>bounding</hi> and <hi>curveting,</hi> the latter is rather to be underſtood in this place; that being moſt like the ſaltation, the leaping or skipping motion of a Graſs-hopper;<note place="margin">

Naturalliſts tells us, that the hinder-legs of Graſs-hoppers are much longer than their fore-legs, to fit them for leaping; the Horſe in his leaping and curveting motion, clearly repreſents the motion of a Graſs-hopper.

This interpretation is much urged by ſeveral of the learned; yet I conceive the purpoſe of theſe words, is rather to ſet forth the boldneſs, than the nimbleneſs of the horſe. Our Tranſlation carries this ſenſe clearly.</p>
                  <q>Canſt thou make him afraid as the Graſhopper.</q>
                  <p>The Graſhopper is a weak and frightful creature, he is ſoon ſcared, and quickly flies away. The word rendred a <hi>Graſhopper,</hi> ſignifies a <hi>multitude,</hi> becauſe they uſually go by multitudes (<hi>Prov.</hi> 30.27.) <hi>The Locuſts have no King, yet go they forth all of them by bands;</hi> they go, as it were, an Army of them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The Latine word <hi>Locuſta,</hi> is from an ill effect of Locuſts or Graſhoppers, becauſe they conſume, and in a manner, burn up every green thing in the places where they come. Hence that alluſive prohibition (<hi>Rev.</hi> 9.4.) <hi>There came out of the ſmoak Locuſts; and it was commanded them that they ſhould not hurt the graſs of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any Tree, &amp;c.</hi> Now, though the Scripture compares theſe creatures to a great Army (<hi>Joel</hi> 2.25.) becauſe they go out in great companies, and do a great deal of miſchief: And though (<hi>Rev.</hi> 9.7.) <hi>The ſhapes of the Locuſts</hi> (there ſpoken of) <hi>were like unto horſes prepared unto battel,</hi> that is, compleatly armed; yet the Locuſts are but a weak kind of Warriers, they are quickly ſcared, they are fearful crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. <hi>Canſt thou make the Horſe afraid like the Graſhopper?</hi> When the Lord ſaith, <hi>Canſt thou make him afraid like the Graſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hopper,</hi> his meaning is, The Horſe is of ſo ſtout a ſpirit, that he will not only not be afraid like the Graſhopper, but no more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid than a Lion. So then, I conclude this part of the verſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains not a ſimilitude, but a diſſimilitude between the horſe and the Graſhopper; not a likeneſs between the horſe and the Graſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hopper in nimbleneſs, but their unlikeneſs in fearfulneſs. <hi>Canſt thou make him</hi>

As importing, that though the horſe ſhould hear a craſhing or ruſhing ſound, like that of an Earth-quake, when the ground under us opens and ſhakes, yet he is not moved nor quakes, as Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi> renders. The horſe is rather enraged, than ſcared like a Graſhopper, by any noiſe; His ſpirit is rather whetted and inflamed, than cowed (as we ſay) and cooled by the ſtrongeſt alarms; as will further appear in the latter part of this deſcription. Horſes are obſerved ſometimes (as alſo men) quaking before a battel, yet not for fear, but with indignation. <hi>Canſt thou make him afraid?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Hence note, Firſt;
<q>The Horſe is a valiant and ſtout-hearted creature.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Not to fear, is a ſign of valour; but not to be made afraid, is much more a ſign of it than not to fear. When any one hath ſuch a ſpirit, that he doth not only fear, but cannot be made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid, there's courage to the height: Such is the courage of the horſe, nothing can make him afraid.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve, Secondly;
<q>The courage, as well as the ſtrength of the Horſe, is from God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>As every creature is not ſtrong, ſo not couragious. Some are very fearful, ſo fearful, that they are grown into a Proverb for fearfulneſs: Such are Hares and Harts, and the Oſtrich before ſpoken of. Nor hath every horſe courage and boldneſs. Horſes given to ſtart, are fearful. God puts ſuch courage into ſome hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that nothing can make them ſtart or fear. Courage is a gift of God beſtowed upon ſome men, and not upon others; ſome are couragious as Lions, and others are fearful as Hares and Harts, or Graſhoppers. We cannot keep ſome from fear; we cannot make others afraid. <hi>Canſt thou make him afraid, as the Graſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hopper?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note, Thirdly;
<q>Where God gives courage, it is not in man to make afraid.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The courage of the horſe appears yet higher in the next verſe.</p>
                  <q>The glory of his noſtrils is terrible.</q>
                  <p>The noſtrils are very conſiderable in horſes, and the largeneſs
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:48669:231"/> or openneſs of them, is a ſign of their goodneſs and ſtoutneſs. <hi>The glory of his noſtrils is terrible,</hi> or <hi>terror,</hi> that is,<note place="margin">Meros terroris naribus ſpirat. <hi>Bez.</hi> Efflat patenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus naribus ventum calen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem irae &amp; au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duciae indicem, quo videtur ille gloriari.

Paul,</hi> before his converſion, breathed flames of fire, as it were, he breathed ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror out of his mouth againſt the faithful people of God. Thus here, <hi>The glory of his noſtrils is terrible.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, what is <hi>this glory of his noſtrils?</hi> Some ſay, theſe words are a deſcription of his neighing; and I grant, that ſound pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from his noſtrils, as from a trumpet, may well enough be called the glory of them; nor can it be denyed, but that the neighing of great horſes is terrible. According to which reading, ſome ſay, the word which we tranſlate <hi>Noſtrils,</hi> ſignifieth in this place, that <hi>ſound</hi> of his noſtrils called <hi>neighing;</hi> and that the word by us rendred <hi>glory,</hi> doth rather ſignifie <hi>excellency</hi> or <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemency.</hi> And thus our old Engliſh Tranſlation gives it; <hi>His ſtrong neighing is fearful;</hi> or as others; <hi>His vehement neighing is terrible.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Hebrew (as was toucht before) is <hi>Terror;</hi> nothing being more common in that language, than to uſe <hi>ſubſtantive</hi> words <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectively,</hi> or, as if they were <hi>Adjectives.</hi> Taking this ſenſe of the words, they deſcribe generous horſes <hi>neighing,</hi> when they go to battle, as if they would thereby at once proclaim and trumpet out their own courage, and terrifie or daunt the enemy; or, as if they would not only ſhew their own fearleſsneſs, but make their oppoſers afraid. This is a fair interpretation, yet becauſe (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to one Expoſition given, and much received, of the latter part of the former verſe, <hi>Haſt thou cloathed his neck with thunder?</hi>) the neighing of the horſe hath been already ſpoken of, I rather conceive, that theſe words, <hi>The glory of his noſtrils is terrible,</hi> may be expounded either of theſe two wayes.</p>

Poets deſcribing the horſe, fancy him ſending fire out of his noſtrils, or breathing fire. And thus when God is angry, ſmoak and fire are ſaid to go out of his noſtrils (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22.9.) Some underſtand that (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.22.) of an angry furious man. As if the Prophet had ſaid, fear not man, make no account of him, though

                  <p>Note, Secondly;

                  </p>
                  <p>To put others in fear, is all their glory, all that they glory in; their glory is not to ſave and to deliver, to comfort and to do good to others, but to vex and to terrifie.</p>

                  <p>Theſe words give a further proof of the courage of the horſe, or a ſign of it; for 'tis the property of the higheſt metal'd and beſt ſpirited horſes to do ſo, as impatient of a check by the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

In ſtrength of both kinds, a well diſciplined horſe may be ſaid to <hi>rejoyce.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The word rendred <hi>rejoyceth,</hi> may rather (ſay ſome) be here tranſlated, <hi>Exulteth,</hi> which imports ſomewhat more than rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, or great rejoycing; &amp; may not unfitly be attributed to beaſts, eſpecially to horſes, &amp; chiefly to ſuch horſes as this Text ſpeaks of. Exultation is the expreſſion of any inward joy, by ſome outward act or geſture of the body; and to do that is very uſual with brave horſes, who being proud of, at leaſt much pleaſed with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, are often ſeen pranſing and jetting as they go, and even artificially forming and compoſing their bodies, their heads and legs eſpecially, at every ſtep they take. So that theſe words, <hi>He rejoyceth, or exulteth in his ſtrength,</hi> ſeem to imply, that the horſe knoweth his own ſtrength and powers. It is commonly ſaid, <hi>If a horſe knew his ſtrength, he were not to be dealt with;</hi> but whether this be true or no, it appears by theſe words in the Text, that he hath ſome knowledge of his ſtrength, elſe he could not be ſaid to rejoyce in it. And this is very aptly inſerted here,
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:48669:233"/> becauſe hence it comes to paſs, that the horſe ruſheth ſo fiercely and fearleſly into the battel, which is the great ſcope of the whole deſcription given of him in this context. <hi>He rejoyceth in his ſtrength.</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, Note;
<q>What we have much of, or excel in, we are apt to rejoyce in.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The horſe hath much ſtrength, and he rejoyceth in it. This appears in all things; If we have much riches, how apt are we to rejoyce in them! If we have much wiſdom, or underſtanding, or parts, how apt are we to rejoyce in them! and therefore the Lord gives us that caveat (<hi>Jer.</hi> 9.23.) <hi>Let not the wiſe man glory in his wiſdom</hi> (as if he had ſaid, If a man have a great deal of wiſdom, or but a little more than his neighbour, he will be glorying in it, as the horſe in his ſtrength) <hi>and let not the mighty man glory in his might, nor the rich man glory in his riches.</hi> All theſe ſtops upon glorying, ſhew, that what we have much of, we are apt to glory in.</p>
                  <p>Note, Thirdly;
<q>To rejoyce in any ſtrength, or in any thing but in God and his favour, or as we enjoy God in any thing, is bruitiſh, 'tis to rejoyce as the horſe.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>They only rejoyce as Chriſtians, who rejoyce in their ſtrength, and in their riches, and in their graces, as they find God in them, and as they flow from God.

<q>Whatever any man hath a mind or a delight to do, that he will go on in, or is free to do.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The horſe goes on to meet the armed men, he doth not ſtand to receive a charge, but he ſeeks it. What any have a great mind to, that they are very forward in; you need not preſs a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teer, nor ſpur a free, a valiant horſe on to the battel, you can hardly hold him in with bit &amp; bridle. 'Tis ſo in any ſervice; where there is a heart ſet to it, with a love to it, O how do we go forth to it! we need not to be haled nor driven to it. So in ſpirituals, a heart of that temper, anſwers every call (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.8.) <hi>When thou ſaidſt, ſeek my face; my heart ſaid unto thee, thy face Lord will I ſeek.</hi> He preſently anſwers the Lords call to any duty, who hath a heart for it. What zeal, what freedom, what forwardneſs have we, to that we have a will and a mind to! An up-hill way, is all down-hill to a willing mind.</p>

                     </note> the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract is here put for the concrete; he laughs at fear, that is, at thoſe things which are moſt to be feared, or which carry the greateſt command of fear in them. It is uſual in Scripture, to expreſs things greatly to be feared, by fear. As things greatly ly hoped for are called our hope, and things rejoyced in greatly are called our joy, ſo things greatly to be feared are called our fear; and in that ſence, above all, God is called <hi>the fear of his people;</hi> he is ſo much the object of fear, that the Scripture calls him <hi>fear. Jacob</hi> in his treating and contract with his Uncle <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban (Gen.</hi> 31.53.) <hi>Sware by the fear of his father Iſaac,</hi> that is, he ſware by God, who alone hath this high honour to be ſworn by in a ſacred way. To ſwear, is a great part of divine worſhip, and is ſometime put for the whole of worſhip. <hi>Jacob ſware by the fear of Iſaac,</hi> that is, by God, who his father <hi>Iſaac</hi> feared, and in whoſe fear he walked all his dayes. Thus ſpake the Prophet (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.12, 13.) <hi>Sanctifie the Lord of Hoſts in your hearts, and let him
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:48669:235"/> be your fear,</hi> which is quoted by the Apoſtle (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15.) Now as God himſelf is called fear, becauſe he is ſo exceedingly to be feared; ſo thoſe things which carry in them much fear, or which are much f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

So the words are an expoſition of what was ſpoken at the cloſe of the 21th <hi>ver. He goeth on to meet the armies,</hi> or the armed men, who are much to be feared and dreaded.</p>
                  <p>In general, whatſoever is or may be matter of fear, that the horſe mocks or laughs at, that is, he counts no more of it, than we do of thoſe things we laugh at.<note place="margin">Quae non cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant hominis rident.</note> What men regard not, care not for, that they laugh at, mock at.

                  <p>Note, Secondly;
<q>That which is not feared, is uſually derided.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is ſo with beaſts, and it is ſo with men; and what more uſual with ſome men, than to mock moſt at thoſe things which they ſhould be moſt afraid of. As there is a nobleneſs of courage in ſome men, which makes a mock of fear; ſo beſides that, there is a baſeneſs of ſpirit, a ſtupidneſs in other men, that make a mock at fear. Such was the ſpirit of <hi>Lots</hi> Sons-in-law (<hi>Gen.</hi> 19.14.) who when <hi>Lot</hi> reported to them, the moſt dreadful thing that ever was in the world, a ſhower of fire and brimſtone, ready to fall down from heaven, upon the whole City to conſume it, <hi>He was to them as one that mocked;</hi> the meaning is, his Sons-in-law mocked at what he reported, they laugh'd at his admonition. Such a kind of mocking at fear, we read in thoſe hardned and debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſpirits among the ten Tribes, when that good King ſent and admoniſhed them to return to the true worſhip of God, and laid before them thoſe dreadful judgments that would ſurely overtake them if they did not (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30.10.) <hi>They laughed to ſcorn the meſſengers, and mockt them:</hi> As if they had ſaid, <hi>What do you tell us of the wrath of God, and of his judgments, if we perſiſt in our way and courſe; we ſcorn your admonition, we regard not your threatnings.</hi> The character given of that people (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.16.) when wrath was breaking out upon them without remedy, was this, <hi>They mockt the meſſengers of God, and deſpiſed his words.</hi> To ſuch mockers at fear, I might take occaſion to ſay, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet in a like caſe (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.22.) <hi>Be ye not mockers, leaſt your bands be made ſtrong.</hi> There are ſome fears that it is our honour to mock at; but there are other fears that will be our ſhame and ruin to mock at: Of all ſuch, that will be true which the Lord ſpake by wiſdom (<hi>Prov.</hi> 1.26.) <hi>I will mock when their fear cometh.</hi> They who mock when fear, that is, when fearful things are threatn'd in the name of the Lord; the Lord will mock at their fear when fearful evils fall upon them. <hi>Sinners will have little mind to mock at laſt.</hi> Such mockers at fear are propheſied of, before the coming of Chriſt, in thoſe two Epiſtles which are of a near complexion and conſtitution (2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.4.) <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this firſt, that there ſhall come in the laſt days (mockers, or) ſcoffers, walking after their own luſts, ſaying, where is the promiſe
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:48669:236"/> of his coming.</hi> And in the Epiſtle of <hi>Jude (ver.</hi> 17, 18.) we have the ſame caution, <hi>Beloved, remember ye the words that were ſpoken before, of the Apoſtles of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, how that they told you, there ſhould be mockers in the laſt time, who ſhould walk after their ungodly luſts.</hi> Take heed you be not found thus like the Horſe mocking at fear, though there be many caſes wherein it is the honour of man, eſpecially, of the ſervants of God, to be in this point like the Horſe, <hi>Who mocketh at fear,</hi>
                     <q>Neither turneth he back from the ſword.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This latter part of the <hi>verſe</hi> is only a confirmation of what was ſaid before, and therefore I ſhall briefly paſs it. Thoſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances or reallities of danger, at which we are affrighted, cauſe us to turn back; but the horſe not being affrighted with, <hi>turneth not back from, the ſword.</hi> The Hebrew is, <hi>he turneth not back from the face of the ſword;</hi> further, the Hebrew is plural, <hi>from the faces of the ſword.</hi> The ſword hath a face, it hath (as it were) many faces, and they all look very terribly; therefore not to be afraid of the faces of the ſword, is a high expreſſion of fearleſneſs. <hi>Not to turn back from the face of the ſword</hi> may have this ſence, not to fear when the ſword is very near him; when the ſword looks the horſe in the face, and makes dreadful faces, then he turns not back from it, nor yields a foot of ground. The Horſe doth not only mock at fear, or at things which are to be fear'd, when they are afar off, but when they are near, even, when the ſword is drawn and brandiſhed before his face. To talk great words, when an enemy is far from us, is the cowards guize; but when we ſee his face, to ſtand to it, is the trial of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.<note place="margin">

                     </note> The Lioneſs is a very fierce and ſtout creature, and yet it is reported, that when ſhe is fighting for her whelps (at which time ſhe is moſt fierce and furious) ſhe caſts her eyes down to the ground, as not being willing to behold the weapons or hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing arms of thoſe who purſue her. But though the natural Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian reports ſome kind of fear in the Lioneſs, yet <hi>Solomon</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports the courage of the Lion altogether fearleſs and undaunted (<hi>Prov.</hi> 30.30.) <hi>He turneth not away for any;</hi> The Hebrew ſaith, <hi>from the face of any;</hi> we may ſay, man or beaſt, that is, ſhe takes not a ſtep back for any; neither man nor beaſt can make him afraid. An ancient Writer, deſcribing the Lion, tells us, He
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:48669:236"/> never feareth, nor flyeth, nor haſteth away in the ſight of any; but though oppreſſed with the multitude or number of his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuers, he makes his retreat ſoftly and gradually, or by ſeveral ſtands, to ſee who dares engage him, as was ſhewed before at the 38th <hi>Chapter (ver.</hi> 39, 40.) Thus the valiant horſe behaves himſelf at the appearance and face of the ſword; he doth not only not turn quite away from the ſword, but doth not ſo much as turn his eyes from it, but looks it full in the face, though it ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a dreadful and bloody face. God, who hath made the horſe for the ſervice of man in war, hath given him a ſpirit ſutable, he is not afraid of the ſword, nor of any other weapon of war, as will further appear from the next <hi>verſe,</hi> when from theſe words, I have briefly Noted,</p>
                  <p>Firſt;
<q>The face or appearance of the ſword is terrible.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſword is one of the moſt terrible things, which the Lord at any time threatneth againſt a ſinful people; the face of the ſword makes many mens faces gather paleneſs, and puts a palſie into their hands.</p>
                  <p>Note, Secondly;
<q>Where there is true courage, not only dangers afar off, but dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers at hand are not turned from.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is ſaid (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.8.) that, <hi>the children of</hi> Ephraim <hi>being armed, and carrying bows</hi> (they had both offenſive and defenſive weapons, yet) <hi>turned back in the day of battle.</hi> They marcht on poſſibly a great while very valiantly, as well as any in the army, and poſſibly made great boaſts what they would do; but when it came to the day of battle, when they ſaw the face of the ſword, then ſaith the Text, <hi>they turned back.</hi> A man of right mettal turns not back, his courage fails not, no not at preſent danger; and that's it which we are to conſider our ſelves in, as to our ſpiritual courage. It is an eaſie matter to ſlight dangers when they are unſeen and only talked of; but when it comes to the day of battle, when ſwords are drawn, and you ſee their terrible faces, then not to turn back, that's courage indeed. And ſo we may underſtand the words of the Apoſtle (<hi>Heb.</hi> 10.38.) where he brings in the Lord ſpeaking thus; <hi>If any man draw back, my ſoul ſhall have no
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:48669:237"/> pleaſure in him.</hi> If any man draw back as a coward, or takes his heels in the day of battle (for of that he ſpake in the 34th <hi>verſe,</hi> telling us of thoſe, <hi>Who endured a great fight of affliction,</hi> even of thoſe that <hi>took joyfully the ſpoiling of their goods,</hi> and doubtleſs were ready to take joyfully the ſpoiling of their lives too; If any man in their caſe turn back f om the very face of the ſword) <hi>My ſoul</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>ſhall have no pleaſure in him;</hi> he is no ſouldier for me, he is not fit for the ſpiritual warfare.</p>
                  <p>As in this <hi>verſe</hi> we have the ſword, ſo in the next, there is an ennumeration of ſeveral other terrible Armes, the ſight whereof gives no trouble to the horſe.</p>

<q>Not to be terrified with noiſes and dreadful ſounds, ſhews ſtrength and ſtoutneſs of ſpirit.</q>

                  <p>It is a piece of valour in the horſe, not to be troubled with or at the ratling of the quiver. The Lord to ſhew that he would totally take away the ſpirit of courage from his own people for their ſins (who had been ſo valiant to ſin againſt him, and would run upon ſin, notwithſtanding the ratling of his quiver, his threatnings, denounced againſt them) telleth them (<hi>Levit.</hi> 26.36.) <hi>I will carry you into the land of your enemies.</hi> What then? <hi>And</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them that are left alive of you, I will ſend a faintneſs into their hearts, in the land of their enemies, and the ſound of a ſhaken leaf ſhall chaſe them.</hi> Now as it ſhews an extream cowardize and faintneſs of ſpirit, to ſhake and run at the ſhaking of a leaf; ſo to ſtand firm, to keep our ground and not be moved, when there is ſuch a noiſe and clattering, as even ſhakes the earth, and confounds all the elements (as it were) this ſhews a mighty courage.</p>

                     <hi>He makes a hole in the earth.</hi> The authority of the <hi>Chaldee</hi> (ſaith <hi>Bootius</hi>) gives credit to this expoſition and ſtrengthens it; becauſe it ſhews, that the word in the <hi>Syriack</hi> tongue (many of which are uſed in this book of <hi>Job</hi>) may well ſignifie to dig or make a hole, ſeeing from this Verbe a
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:48669:238"/> Noune is derived, which in that language ſignifies a hole or pit. And if we take this interpretation (ſaith he) the words would not be a bare, much leſs a needleſs repetition of what was ſaid (<hi>ver.</hi> 21.) <hi>He paweth in the valley.</hi> For though (according to this reading) the Text in both places ſpeaks of hollowing the earth, yet we may give this difference; the former being to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of thoſe lighter touches, which wanton luſty horſes with one foot give the earth; but this latter, of great and deep im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions which they make in the earth with all their feet, while heated with a deſire to charge the enemy, they are reſtrained and held in, till the ſignal be given.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Others laying a ſide the metaphorical ſenſe of the word <hi>ſwalloweth,</hi> expound it properly of his biting or gnawing the earth. A generous horſe,<note place="margin">Morſu terram abſorbere vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>detur.</note> to ſhew how he would eat up the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my when he comes at him, before he comes at him, doth not only paw in the earth with his foot, but gnaws the earth with his teeth, as if he would ſwallow it up. And to ſwallow up a thing imports in all languages, at leaſt a ſuppoſed or conceited eaſineſs of doing it. We, ſpeaking proverbially, uſe to ſay, we could do ſuch or ſuch a thing, as eaſily as we can eat or drink. The horſe when he cannot come preſently to wreek his rage upon the enemy, doth it upon the earth; in gnawing of which he ſeems to tell his enemies, that he will tear their fleſh, and gnaw their bones as ſoon as he can come at them. And I find one, who by earth in this place, underſtands men (as all are) made of earth; but though it may bear a tolerable ſenſe, to ſay, that a ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſe in his fierceneſs and rage, would even eat or ſwallow up the enemy; yet to expound the <hi>earth</hi> by the enemy, <hi>exceeds</hi> (ſaith a learned Author) <hi>all abſurdity.</hi> But,</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I rather conceive (as ſome of the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> and not a few of our Modern Writers do) that by ſwallowing the earth with fierceneſs and rage, we are to underſtand only the ſwiftneſs of his courſe or motion, when once he hath but the reins let looſe to the battle, he will run as if he would ſwallow the ground, and that ſhews his courage too. We ſay of a man that runs with ſpeed,<note place="margin">Abſorbere ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram dicitur phraſi Hebraea velociſſimè currere. <hi>Bold.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>he doth not feel the ground:</hi> The horſe is in ſuch extream haſt to be gone, and to be at the battle, that he runs, as if he neither felt nor left any earth under him.

                  <p>I ſhall give two interpretations of the words, in anſwer to this queſtion.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, thus: <hi>He believes not that it is the ſound of the Trumpet;</hi> that is, whereas it might be thought, that the ſound of the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet ſhould terrifie him, he regards it no more than a man doth that which he doth not believe, he cares not for it, he is not at all troubled at it. Thus our old Engliſh Tranſlation hath it; <hi>He regardeth not the noiſe of the trumpets.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, thus: <hi>He believes not that it is the ſound of the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet;</hi> that is, he hath ſo great a mind to the battel, that when the trumpet ſounds indeed to the battel, he doubts it is not ſo, 'tis too good news to be true; he ſcarce believes his own ears; or, he deſireth the battel ſo much, that he believes the ſignal of it very little, and fears it is not ſo, but ſome falſe alarm. This is a good and probable interpretation, it being uſual among men (from whom in proportion to beaſts, eſpecially to gallant horſes, this affection may be transferred) hardly at firſt to believe or give credit to thoſe things which they extreamly deſire and wiſh, yea, long for. In this ſenſe it may well be ſaid of the Horſe, <hi>He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves not that it is the ſound of the trumpet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>That which is much deſired, is in ſome caſes hardly believed.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis uſually ſaid, <hi>We eaſily believe that which we would or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to have;</hi> yet ſometimes we hardly believe that which we

It is ſaid of the diſciples of Chriſt, when he appeared to them after his Reſurrection, and ſhewed them his hands and his feet (<hi>Luke</hi> 21.41.) <hi>They believed not for joy;</hi> they were ſo glad of the thing, they could not believe their own eyes.

Sarah</hi> over-hearing this good news, <hi>Laughed within her ſelf</hi> (verſ. 12.)

If ſhe had laught as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, at the day of Chriſt, <hi>who ſaw Chriſts day and rejoyced (John</hi> 8.56.) that is, he laughed in faith, in aſſurance that it would come; but <hi>Sarah</hi> laughed, as doubting, ſure this will never be; though might ſhe have had her wiſh, ſhe would of all things in the world, have deſired and wiſhed a ſon. Once more (<hi>Acts</hi> 12.15.) when <hi>Peter</hi> was in priſon, and prayer made by the Church night and day, doubtleſs they pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in faith for his delivery, yet when <hi>Peter</hi> was delivered, and knockt at the door, they ſaid to the Maid, who told them it was <hi>Peter, Thou art mad</hi> (verſ. 15.)

The valiant horſe deſires nothing more than an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement in battel, but believes not it is the ſound of the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet.</p>
                  <p>Thus of the ſecond expoſition of theſe words, <hi>Neither b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="456" facs="tcp:48669:240"/> (in their kind) at it, as is ſaid expreſly in the next verſe; yet it cannot be conveniently ſaid, that he hath ſo great a joy as to produce this diſ-belief: For ſo to rejoyce, as to be in a manner overcome with joy, &amp; not to give credit to our eyes and ears, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver happens, but as in extreamly great and extraordinary joys, ſo in unaccuſtomed and unexpected joys, which ſurely cannot well be affirmed of that joy which horſes are taken with at the ſound of a trumpet, ſignalizing a battel to enſue.</p>
                  <p>And therefore (becauſe it avoids this difficulty) I ſhall rather adhere to them, who render the words thus, <hi>Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth he ſtand ſtill (or keep his ground) when the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet ſoundeth.</hi>

                  <p>Hence note;
<q>What we have much mind to do, we are glad of an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to do it, and readily embrace it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle ſaith of the old Patriarks (<hi>Heb.</hi> 11.15.) <hi>Truly if they had been mindful of</hi> (that is, if they had had a mind to) <hi>that Country from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned.</hi> Now, as a man will not do that for which he hath an opportunity, when he hath no mind to it; ſo if a man hath a mind to do any thing, how ſoon doth he make uſe of the very firſt opportunity to do it. And doubtleſs it was a great trouble to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> who had a true deſire to ſhew their care of, and love to the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> that they lacked oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to ſhew it, and give a real proof of it (<hi>Phil.</hi> 4.10.)

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> in all thoſe places is paragogical; yet Paragoges may have more in them, than meerly the ornament of ſpeech. Our Tranſlators in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate as much (<hi>Hab.</hi> 2.13.) where they do not render barely, <hi>in the fire,</hi> and <hi>for vanity,</hi> but <hi>in the very fire,</hi> and <hi>for very vanity.</hi> And therefore (with the good leave of that learned Author) I apprehend (with the Rabbin, whom he quotes, but likes not for this opinion) that in all places where this word is uſed, it hath a ſpecial force, declaring the greatneſs and continuance of the thing ſpoken of.

And all men know (who know any thing of the qualities or cuſtoms of gallant horſes) that it is uſual with them to neigh when they are much pleaſed, and are upon a neer attainment of their deſire, or the injoyment of their pleaſures.

<q>Aſſurance of what we would have, breeds extream joy and triumph in his ſpirit that would have it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>When the horſe finds it is the battel indeed, then he rejoyceth
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:48669:242"/> greatly. Men often break out into ſuch exclamations, when ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been long doubtful of a thing, and fearful how it might iſſue, they at laſt ſee its iſſue anſwering the utmoſt of their wiſhes and expectations (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.15.) <hi>Let them</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) be deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late for a reward of their ſhame, that ſay, Ah, ha, Ah, ha;</hi> that is, let them be rewarded with deſolation, for their ſhameful do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, in ſaying, Ah, ha, Ah, ha, becauſe they ſee me caſt down. To ſay, Ah, ha, at what is done, is as much as to ſay, it pleaſeth us well, it gives us high content. Thus alſo they cryed out (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 35.21.) <hi>Ah, ha, our eyes have ſeen it.</hi> As the viſion we ſhall have in heaven, is faith perfected in the higheſt aſſurance imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable; ſo in any caſe in this world, what of our deſires our eyes ſee, we take high content in. It is comfortable when we have ſome hope of what we deſire; but when we once ſee it, then we cry <hi>Ah, ha,</hi> if what our eyes ſee, be to us as theirs was to them in the ſame Pſalm, where they are again brought in ſaying, <hi>Ah, ha, ſo would we have it</hi> (ver. 25.) now it is as it ſhould be; we have been looking for ſuch a day a long time, but now it is come; Ah, ha, Ah, ha, <hi>So would we have it.</hi> And conſider it either in natural or ſpiritual things; there is a time as to ſpiritual things, when we do not believe the ſilver trumpet of the Goſpel ſounds mercy to us, that ſin is pardoned, that God is gracious; but when once there is a convincing ſufficiency of the trumpets ſound, when once our unbelief is fully overcome, and our hearts wound up to aſſurance, then the ſoul is in its triumph, and cryes out (as the horſe, when he perceives the deſired battel approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) <hi>Ah, ha, Ah, ha.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This content of the horſe appears yet further in the next words.</p>
                  <q>He ſmells the battel afar off, the thunder of the Captains, and the ſhouting.</q>
                  <p>Theſe words hold out another matter, which doth much ſet forth and commend the honour of the horſe, and his deſire of the combat; <hi>He ſmells the battel.</hi> To be in battel pleaſeth him ſo well, that the ſmell of it is to him a delightful and pleaſant odour. The very ſtink of a Camp (as the Prophet calls it, <hi>Amos</hi> 4.10.) is a ſweet perfume to his noſtrils. <hi>He ſmells a battel,</hi>

                        </gap>
                     </note> yet ſome conclude it to be an Adverb of time. So 'tis uſed (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 25.1.) where the Prophet be ſpeaks the Lord thus; <hi>Thy counſels of old</hi> (that is, thoſe counſels which thou, O Lord, haſt had a long time ago, or long before time) <hi>are faithfulneſs and truth.</hi> We alſo render the word, by <hi>long ago</hi> (1 <hi>King</hi> 19.25.)</p>
                  <p>But it may be objected, Though the word in thoſe places notes time, yet it cannot do ſo in this place of <hi>Job;</hi> for in thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces alleadged, it ſignifies a vaſt ſpace of time before, whereas here in <hi>Job,</hi> if it denotes time, it is but a very ſhort ſpace of time, no more than the ſpace of time, between giving the ſignal of a battel by ſound of trumpet, and the joyning of the battel. To this, the anſwer is; That this Hebrew word may be applied to a ſhort ſpace of time, as well as to a long one, ſeeing both the

                  <p>Now according to this ſenſe of the word, this latter clauſe of the verſe is thus tranſlated; <hi>He ſmelleth,</hi> or, <hi>perceiveth the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel is neer at hand, or will ſhortly be:</hi> Which gives a very fair meaning of the Text, if that word, which all grant ſignifies time as well as place, doth alſo ſignifie a ſhort, as well as a long ſpace of time; for then the verſe runs clearly thus, <hi>At the full ſound of the trumpet, he ſaith, Ha, ha, ſmelling (or perceiving) that the battel is at hand.</hi> I leave this to the Readers judgement. Our own tranſlation is an undoubted truth, both as to the ſignification of the word, and the experiences of the thing. A Gallant horſe trained up, and accuſtomed to War, when he ſees much ſtirring in an Army, and hears the trumpets ſounding, perceives a battel will be, though the armies be poſſibly a good diſtance of ground one from the other. Thus <hi>he ſmells the battel afar off,</hi> eſpecially when he hears that which follows in the cloſe of the verſe.</p>
                  <q>The thunder of the Captains and the ſhouting.</q>
                  <p>This is muſick to him. Here are two other antecedents of a battle, which the horſe takes notice of.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>The thunder of the Captains or Princes;</hi> that is, of the great Commanders and Generals of the field; who when they give out the word, they give it with a loud voice, they thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it out. 'Tis no time to whiſper when armies are ready to joyn battle; and therefore Commanders lift up their voices like trumpets, or like thunder out of the clouds, that the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers may hear them. And when Captains or Generals give ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation to the Souldiers, they thunder out arguments to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them, and fire their ſpirits to the battle. The horſe doth as it were hear this thunder; oh! it pleaſes him when the military oration is made, and the Captain-general gives order for the battle.</p>
                  <q>And the ſhouting.</q>
                  <p>What's that? Surely, the acclamation of the whole army: when the Captain,<note place="margin">Confuſus cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor exercitus Praeparantis ſe ad praelium. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="463" facs="tcp:48669:243"/> for the battle: Thus the horſe ſmells the battle afar off, the thunder of the Captains and the ſhouting. The whole <hi>verſe</hi> may be read in this form; <hi>At the ſufficient ſound of the trumpet, and the exhortation of the Captains, together with the acclamations of the Souldiers, he ſaith, Ah, ha, (or rejoyceth) perceiving that the battle (though the armies be not yet joyned, but keep their ground at a diſtance) is at hand, or will ſuddainly be.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having opened this whole context concerning the horſe, and given ſeveral obſervations from the parts of it; I ſhall for the cloſe of all ſhew how aptly this deſcription of the horſe repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, or is applicable unto two very different ſorts of men.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The Horſe, as here deſcribed, is the embleme of a bold and hardened ſinner. The Spirit of God ſpeaks this expreſsly (<hi>Jer.</hi> 8.6.) <hi>I harkened, and heard</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>but they ſpake not aright, no man repented him of his wickedneſs, ſaying, what have I done; every one turned to his courſe</hi> (what courſe? his ſinful courſe, how?) <hi>as the horſe ruſheth into the battle;</hi> as the horſe mocks at fear, and will not turn back from the ſword; As the horſe will not be affrighted at the ratling of the quiver, nor at the ſhaking of the ſpear; ſo hardened ſinners ruſh on, though you tell them there's deadly danger in it, and that the Sword of the Word points directly at them, and will cut them off: Yea, they will not turn back, though the Lord ſhould brandiſh a flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſword, as he did againſt <hi>Adam,</hi> to keep him from the tree of life, ſo to keep them from the tree of death; they, will for all this, ruſh on as the horſe to the battle. The wicked man is thus deſcribed, in one place of this book of <hi>Job (Chap.</hi> 15.25, 26.) where <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſaith of him, <hi>He ſtretcheth out his hand againſt God</hi> (here's war with God) <hi>and ſtrengthens himſelf againſt the Almighty</hi> (that is, draws all his forces together; and what then? juſt as the horſe in the Text) <hi>He runs upon the thick boſſes of his buckler, even upon his neck.</hi> A wicked man, like the horſe, runs upon God, even upon the thick boſſes of his buckler. The Lord is there repreſented, by <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> as holding out a buckler againſt the ſinner; what's that? the Law, his Word of command, that's Gods buckler; and this buckler hath thick boſſes and ſharp points, eſpecially, in the middle, a great boſs with a pike, ſuch are all divine threatnings, yet the ſinner runs, as a horſe, upon theſe thick boſſes of Gods buckler, his ſevereſt threatnings. Thus the horſe, and a bold ſinner are alike.</p>
                  <pb n="454" facs="tcp:48669:244"/>
                  <p>Secondly, The horſe is alſo the embleme of a bold Saint, or of a faithful ſervant of God. Such, ſpecially, were all the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Martyrs;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>St.</hi> Auſtine.</note> A chief among the Ancients ſaith expreſsly, that in the Horſe the Martyr may be ſeen; whom none account valiant but God himſelf, and they who are born of God. I may Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel a holy Martyr and the Horſe, in every particular mentioned in this context. Firſt, As the horſe is ſaid to receive his ſtrength from God <hi>(haſt thou given ſtrength to the horſe?)</hi> ſo it was God who gave ſtrength to the Martyrs, to ſtand it out in the day of battle. Secondly, As God gives courage to the horſe, ſo it was God that gave courage to the Martyrs; and ſuch courage he hath ſometimes given, as hath made poor weak women as ſtrong and couragious, as the horſe in the Text: Perſecuters could not make the old martyrs run like Graſhoppers; they have even mocked at fear, and would not turn back from the face of the ſword drawn out againſt them; no ratling of the quiver, nor claſhing of weapons could terrifie them; they have not been affrighted with Lions, Bears, Tygers ready to devour them; they have not been affrighted with the fiery furnace, nor with the moſt exquiſite torments that the wit or malice of man could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent. Jeſus Chriſt having inſtructed the Church his Spouſe (<hi>Cant.</hi> 1.8.) what to do, he at the 9th <hi>verſe</hi> commends the Church in two things. Firſt, For her courage.

Experience (we know) hath made this good; for the true Spouſe of Chriſt, though poor, comtemptible and weak, though women and even but children, though helpleſs ſheep and tender lambs,
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:48669:244"/> yet in battles of ſuffering for Chriſt, they have become as mighty as the mightieſt war-horſes, they have withſtood all the powers of the world undauntedly, and made them admire their courage, yea, vexed and madded them with their courage. Who but the Lord could arm his people with ſpiritual weapons, with power and courage, to overcome all their enemies, or to over-overcome them, as the word is (<hi>Rom.</hi> 8.37.) which we render, <hi>more than conquerors;</hi> over what? over ſword, and nakedneſs, and perils, and danger, and death; we more then overcome all theſe (ſaith the Apoſtle there) <hi>though we are killed all the day long, and counted as ſheep for the ſlaughter,</hi> as he ſpeaks at the 36th <hi>verſe.</hi> And hence the Prophet ſaid (<hi>Zach.</hi> 10.3, 5.) that though the Church, there called, <hi>the houſe of</hi> Judah, be weak like a flock, yet the Lord <hi>makes them as his goodly horſe in the battle.</hi> Our late Annotators give the ſenſe of the Prophet in thoſe words expreſsly thus. Now that the Lord hath turned his favourable countenance towards his people, he hath endowed them with valour and ſtrength; ſo that of ſheep they are become a great war-horſe, with which the Lord will overcome and trample down his enemies; which may in part be underſtood of the <hi>Maccabeees</hi> victory, but moſt perfectly of the whole Churches victories over the world and the devil. This victory the Church obtains over the devil by reſiſting, and over the world by ſuffering.</p>
                  <p>Thus far of the valiant horſe. The Lords diſcourſe proceeds from this noble beaſt of the earth, to thoſe noble birds of the air, the Hawk and the Eagle.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Job</hi> is firſt queſtioned about the Hawk in the 26th <hi>verſe;</hi> In which the Hawk is ſet forth two ways. Firſt, In general, by her flying, <hi>Doth the Hawk flie by thy wiſdom?</hi> Secondly, in ſpecial, by the courſe of her flight, <hi>and ſtretch forth her wings toward the South?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Job</hi> is queſtioned about the Eagle, concerning which (Queen among birds) fix things are here expreſsly ſet forth, or diſtinctly expreſſed.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Her high flying or mounting upwards, in the former part of the 27th <hi>verſe, Doth the Eagle mount up at thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Her high neſting or making her neſt on high, in the latter part of the ſame <hi>verſe;</hi> doth ſhe, at thy command, <hi>make her neſt on high?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, She is here diſcribed by the choiſe of her abode, dwelling or habitation (<hi>ver.</hi> 28.) <hi>ſhe dwelleth and abideth on the rock, on the crag of the rock, and in the ſtrong place.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, We have here the ſharpneſs of the Eagles appetite, and her quick endeavour to get food for the ſatisfying of it,
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:48669:245"/> in the former part of the 29th <hi>verſe. When</hi> ſhe is abiding upon the rock, upon the crag of the rock, and in her ſtrong place, <hi>from thence ſhe ſeeks her prey;</hi> ſhe is not idle there.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, She is deſcribed by the ſharpneſs of her ſight, in the latter part of the 29th <hi>verſe, her eyes behold afar off.</hi> As if the Lord had ſaid, though ſhe dwells thus high upon the rock, and the crag of the rock, yet this doth not hinder her in the purſuit of her prey, <hi>for her eyes behold afar off.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly and Laſtly, We have here the matter, or nature of her own food and diet, together with the food of her young ones. We have here (as I may ſay) a Bill of the Eagles fare (<hi>ver.</hi> 30.) it is blood, and the fleſh of the ſlain, <hi>Her young ones ſuck up blood; and where the ſlain are, there is ſhe:</hi> That's her chief food and diet, the fleſh and blood of the ſlain.

                  <p>From the whole I ſhall give only this general note, as to the Lords purpoſe in ſpeaking of theſe birds of prey, the Hawk and the Eagle, rather than of the Dove, or of any other fowl of a more harmleſs nature. I ſay, the Lord doth this to ſhew, that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his providence diſpoſeth of, and watcheth over theſe fowls of the air, which are ſo able to ſhift for themſelves, and are in their kind ſo little uſeful to man; then ſurely, he will not neglect man, nor any creature that is of neceſſary uſe to man.</p>

                  <p>The word rendred <hi>Hawk</hi> comes from a root which ſignifies a <hi>feather</hi> or <hi>plume of feathers;</hi> becauſe, feathers are the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by which the Hawk flyeth. The ſame word ſignifies alſo to fly; the Hawk being a fowl of ſuch an excellent flight, may well be expreſt by a word which properly ſignifies flying.</p>
                  <p>The Hawk is numbred among the unclean birds in the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which the Jews might not eat of (<hi>Levit.</hi> 11.16.<note place="margin">

                  <p>Nor will it be unprofitable, upon this occaſion, to take notice how the Lord then ſet bounds and limits to the appetite of man,

The Jews might not feed upon the Hawk, becauſe ſhe is a bird of prey, and lives by ravening and killing other birds; ſuch was the law among the Jews: and though that law be now taken away,<note place="margin">Dicitur Latinè accipiter ab ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipiendo, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter inſitam et inſatiabilem rapacitatem.

                  <p>The word by which the Hawk is expreſt in the Latine, ſignifies to take or catch, whereby her ravening nature is denoted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe catches and ſnatches all ſhe can for her living. Some of the Ancients tell us, that the Hawk is a very princely bird, who though ſhe h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>een of birds. And ſome report, that there is no other among all the fowls of the air, that dares contend with the Eagle, but the Hawk. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> reckons up ten ſorts of Hawks, and <hi>Pliny</hi> ſixteen: But I ſhall leave that diſcourſe to Faulconers. It is enough for the opening of this Scripture, to intimate ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in generat of the Hawk.</p>
                  <q>Doth the Hawk fly.</q>
                  <p>The Hawk is deſcribed as flying. Some creatures are for going, ſome for running, but the excellency of the Hawk is in flying: And flying here is not to be taken in a general ſenſe, as oppoſed to running or going, for ſo it is common to all the birds of the aire; there's not the leaſt, not any of the winged kind, but can fly little or much: But when he ſaith, <hi>Doth the Hawk fly?</hi> fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is to be underſtood ſpecially, of ſwift flying, and of long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued flying. The Hawk flies with wonderful ſwiftneſs. Hence among the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> the Hawk was a Hierogliphick of the winds. And as the Hawk moves with wonde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ful ſwiftneſs, ſo with great perſeverance. Naturaliſts tell us, and it is the experience of many, that the Hawk will abide upon the wing, two, three, yea, four
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:48669:246"/> hours together in the purſute of, or in waiting for her prey; and hence ſome of the Ancients have made the flying of the Hawk, or the Hawk in his flying, an emblance of perſeverance. The Hawk moves in the air, as if he abode immoveably there.</p>
                  <q>Doth the Hawk fly by thy wiſdom, <hi>or underſtanding?</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>Thou ſeeſt how perſeveringly the Hawk flies, and how cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly, or wiſely, to her beſt advantage: Doth the Hawk fly thus by thy wiſdom, or haſt thou taught the Hawk to fly thus? haſt thou inſtructed the Hawk to make this uſe of her wings? no, the Hawk flieth by my wiſdom, I have given her this ſtrength, and taught her this skill, for God takes it unto himſelf, it is by my wiſdom and inſtruction that the Hawk flyeth.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Vulgar Latine</hi> reads thus, <hi>Doth the Hawk feather her ſelf,</hi>

Firſt, Doſt thou make the Hawks feathers grow at firſt, doſt thou plant thoſe feathers in her wings? ſurely, no. Secondly, Doſt thou renew the Hawks feathers? When the Hawk hath mued or leaſt her feathers (as they who are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with Hawks know their natural cuſtome is) doſt thou cauſe them to grow again? ſurely, no, thou didſt neither at firſt plant her wings with feathers, nor when ſhe hath caſt her fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, doſt thou cauſe thoſe feathers to renew; that's a good reading: But I ſhall keep to our own. <hi>Doth the Hawk fly by thy wiſdom?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note, Firſt;
<q>The Lord hath given man ſome creatures more to ſerve his pleaſure, than his neceſſities.</q>

                  <p>Whatever ſervice the Hawk doth to man in catching the prey, the Partridge, or Pheſant, or other fowl, man might ſerve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of them (as many do) ſome other and cheaper way, and not by hawking.

                     <hi>even to his delight and content.</hi> God hath given ſuch ſwift wings to the Hawk, not only to ſet forth his own power, but for mans pleaſure.
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:48669:247"/> Hawks are for the ſport and delight of Princes and great men; and ſeeing God hath made ſome creatures for the delight, more than for the neceſſity, for the pleaſure, more than for the need of man; O how ſhould man take heed of diſpleaſing God! Doth the great God of heaven and earth provide Hawks for mans plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and ſhall man take no care to pleaſe God! 'Tis lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to conſider, how moſt men diſpleaſe God by oaths and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanations of his Name, while they are taking that kind of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. And I may ſay, there is no kind of ſport which the indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of God hath allowed man, wherein God is more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked and diſhonoured, than in this: What ſwearing, what cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, is there in following this Game; If Hawks and Spannels pleaſe not men in the purſuit of their pleaſures, how is the Name of God rent and torn, to his high diſpleaſure! How vain is that man, who takes pleaſure in ſin, or who ſins in taking his pleaſure! He makes his ſhort pleaſure-time a ſeed-time (without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance) of his everlaſting paines and ſorrows.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Whereas the queſtion is put, <hi>Doth the Hawk flie by thy wiſdom?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note;
<q>It is by the wiſdom and teaching of God that the Hawk flieth.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Not only hath the Lord put the general power of flying into the Hawk, as into other birds, but that ſpecial excellency to flie ſo ſwiftly and ſtrongly, ſo cunningly and artificially. 'Tis not ſo much the Faulconer, who teacheth the Hawk, as God; then let us admire the wiſdom of God in the properties of every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. It muſt be confeſſed, that Hawks do ſtrange things; but but whence is it? it is of God. <hi>Doth the Hawk flie by thy wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;</hi> canſt thou manage the Hawk, or bring her to thy Lure; canſt thou make her go off after her prey? canſt thou reclaim her at thy pleaſure? Thou canſt not; only God can. And hence we may infer, If the flying of the Hawk be from the wiſdom of God, then ſee the wiſdom of God in the goings and doings of man. <hi>The way of man</hi> (ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.23.) <hi>is not in himſelf; it is not in him that walketh, to direct his ſteps;</hi> the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Lord doth it. If the wiſdom of the Lord orders the flying of a bird in the air, ſurely then 'tis the wiſdom of the Lord
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:48669:247"/> which manageth the motions of men on earth; he orders both the courſe and diſcourſe of man: when he pleaſeth he can take wiſdom from the wiſeſt men, and make even Judges fools. Judges are ſuppoſed and accounted the wiſeſt among men, yet the Lord can befool them ſo, that they ſhal not be able to ſee the things that belong either to their own peace, or the peace of others. The Lord, who gives wiſdom to beaſts and birds, can take it from men. <hi>Doth the Hawk flie by thy wiſdom?</hi> That's the general; then follows a ſpecial inſtance concerning the courſe of the Hawk;
<q>And ſtretch <hi>(or ſpread)</hi> her wings towards the South.</q>

                     </note> The <hi>South</hi> is ſo called, becauſe when a man turns his face to the Eaſt, or Sun-riſing, then the South is on his right hand.</p>
                  <p>But why is the Hawk ſaid <hi>to ſtretch forth her wings to the South?</hi> we may expound it two wayes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Thus: <hi>She ſtretcheth her wings to the South,</hi> when ſhe is upon the change of her feathers, of which a touch was given be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. As if the Lord had ſaid, <hi>When the time cometh, that the Hawk caſts her feathers, doth ſhe by thy wiſdom</hi> (for that we are to take in) <hi>ſtretch her wings towards the South,</hi> (as Naturaliſts tell us ſhe doth) <hi>for the cheriſhing of her new feathers?</hi> The South wind being a warm wind, opens the pores of the body, and then the old feathers eaſily fall off, and the new ones come on; therefore when the Hawk loſeth her feathers, ſhe ſtretches out her wings towards the South. And as the wild unmanaged Hawks, who are at their own liberty, turn themſelves to the South at ſuch times, ſo the Places where Faulconers keep Hawks to train them for ſervice, are built towards the South, that the warmth of the Sun may help the growth of their feathers.</p>
                  <p>'Tis not unworthy our remembrance, which ſome teach alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorically from this natural inſtinct of the Hawk, helping her ſelf more eaſily, both to caſt and recover her feathers. A ſinner in his natural ſtate, is ſo feathered as he comes from the old <hi>Adam,</hi> that he had need to caſt the old and get new ones. Now if the ſinner would do thus, or when he doth thus, he is taught by the wiſdom of God (not by the wiſdom of the fleſh) to ſtretch him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf towards the South, that is, towards the pleaſant wind, and
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:48669:248"/> warm Sun of the Spirit of God, by which his old feathers of ſin drop off, and thoſe new feathers of grace and holineſs, of faith and repentance, of meekneſs and humility, of patience and ſelf-denial come on. Thus man is feathered by the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> when he hath caſt thoſe of the firſt; He turns himſelf to the South, he applieth himſelf to Jeſus Chriſt, the Sun of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, whoſe bleſſed warmth fetcheth off his old black feathers, and cloaths him with new and beautiful ones. The Lord who teacheth the Hawk to ſtretch her wings to the South, muſt teach us to ſtretch our ſelves to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that our old fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers may fall away, and that we may be renewed by his Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There is another account given about the Hawks ſtretching her wings to the South; for not only when the Hawk renews her feathers, doth ſhe return to the South; but wilde Hawks that are at liberty, living in colder climates, uſe in Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to change their quarters, and turn to the South, that is, to thoſe coaſts which are more favoured by the Sun,<note place="margin">

                     </note> as they who write the nature of beaſts and birds make report. All kind of Hawks are tender, and cannot well abide the Winter cold, but get into the Sun, and ſometimes duſt themſelves in the ſand, when heated by the Sun, as in very hot ſeaſons they delight to bath themſelves in water. It is ſaid, that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> uſed of old to picture, or repreſent the Sun in the ſhape of a Hawk; Firſt, becauſe the Hawk is a great lover of the Sun; Secondly, becauſe of the live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heat and ſp'ritfuneſs of the Hawk, like that of the Sun; Thirdly, becauſe of the longevity of the Hawk (the Hawk is a long-lived creature.) Fourthly, becauſe of the quick-ſighted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Hawk, whence they called the Hawk <hi>All-eye.</hi> And Laſtly, becauſe of the ſwiftneſs of the Hawk. The Hawk flies with ſuch a ſpeed, as if he did emulate, or would imitate the Sun. The Hawk being thus like the Sun, and ſuch a lover of the Sun, they ſhadowed the Sun by the figure of a Hawk; all which may give us ſome intimation of the ground of what is here ſaid, <hi>That ſhe ſtretcheth her wings towards the South.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>God hath given irrational creatures a knowledge of what is moſt convenient for their own preſervation.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Why doth the Hawk ſpread forth her wings to the South? ſhe
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:48669:248"/> finds it beſt for her, and therefore doth (<hi>Jer.</hi> 8.7.) <hi>The Stork in the heaven, and the Crane, and the Swallow know the time of their coming;</hi> Whither? ſurely to ſome warmer climate, when the weather is cold and offenſive to them in the place where they are; and when the heat returns to the coaſts from whence they came, thither they return again; <hi>They know the time of their coming,</hi> they know when 'tis good for them to be in one Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and when in another. And is not this a rebuke (as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet there applieth it) unto a man, who many times knows not what's good for himſelf, knows not <hi>the judgement of the Lord;</hi> that is, what God would have him do, or what courſe to take in ſuch a time and ſeaſon, or under ſuch a diſpenſation of providence; knows not (as I may ſay) Winter and Summer, heat and cold, and ſo is not ſo wiſe as the fowls of the air generally are, or as the Hawk in particular is here ſaid to be, <hi>Who ſtretcheth her wings to the South.</hi> All the children of men have, and the children of God know they have a South to ſtretch their wings unto; that is, the goodneſs and power of God, as the Pſalmiſt ſpake, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder the ſhadow of thy wings ſhall be my refuge, till theſe calamities be overpaſt.</hi> I will ſtretch my ſelf to the South, to the love and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God; 'tis beſt for all men to ſtretch their wings toward thoſe wings of God in an evil day. All ſhould do as the Lord gives the invitation (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.20.) <hi>Come my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and ſhut the doors about thee; hide thy ſelf, as it were, for a little moment, until the indignation be over-paſt.</hi> Thus the Lord directs his people to ſtretch themſelves to the South, when 'tis cold and hard weather abroad in the world; and the creatures ſpoken of by the Prophet, as well as the Hawk in the Text, will riſe up in judgement againſt us, if we ſtretch not our wings to the South, when we feel the Northern cold, and Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter froſt taking hold of us.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall paſs from this part of the verſe concerning the Hawk, when I have only minded the Reader, that ſome have found a twofold reſemblance in the Hawk.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, They reſemble the Devil and evil ſpirits, to the Hawk, becauſe of their devouring nature. The old Poet ſaid,<note place="margin">Odimus accipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trem quia ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per vivit in armis. <hi>Ovid.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>We hate the Hawk, becauſe ſhe is alwayes in arms.</hi> And ſo is the Devil, he is always in arms, and at war with the Church of God, and with the ſouls of men; and we ought alwayes to be in arms againſt the
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:48669:249"/> Devil, yea, to take to our ſelves <hi>the whole armour of God,</hi> ſpoken of (<hi>Eph.</hi> 6.) to reſiſt him, and defend our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Hawk is like wicked men, eſpecially in three things;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, For their ravenous nature, they love to deſtroy and live upon the ſpoyl of others (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.1.)</p>
                  <p>Secondly, They are like the Hawk, preying moſtly upon thoſe that are moſt innocent. The Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>The wicked devours the man that is more righteous than he.</hi> The Hawk purſues the Dove and poor Partridge, harmleſs creatures.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Hawk is high-priz'd when alive, but when dead, caſt out upon the dunghil, no man regarding her. He that took great delight in his Hawk while alive, will not call for it to his Table when dead. Thus wicked men may be in great eſteem while they live, but when once dead, they are as thrown upon the dunghil, their memorial rots, and is unſavoury. So much for the 26th verſe, wherein the Spirit of God calls <hi>Job</hi> to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the nature of the Hawk at any time flying, and ſometimes turning her flight to the South. And now the queſtion paſſeth from the Prince of birds, to the Queen of birds.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The Eagles flight, or mount, exceeds the Hawks; or any other of the winged train, in three things;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, In the ſwiftneſs of it. The Eagle hath great and long wings (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 17.3.) and ſhe can make great haſt with them; therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> calling upon us, not to ſet our eyes upon riches, gives the reaſon of his counſel (<hi>Prov.</hi> 23.5.) <hi>For riches cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly make themſelves wings, they flie away as an Eagle towards heaven;</hi> that is, they are ſuddenly gone, and will not return at thy call. The Eagle will not come to the Lure, like the Hawk. To flie away as an Eagle, notes two things concerning riches; Firſt, That they will flie away ſwiftly, ſpeedily, they are ſoon gone; ſuch is the Eagles flight. Secondly, That they (often) flie away irrecoverably, there's no recalling them. The Scripture of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten expreſſeth the more than ordinary ſwiftneſs of men, by the ſwiftneſs of the Eagle. <hi>David</hi> lamenting the death of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Jonathan,</hi> gives them this character (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.23.) <hi>They were ſtronger than Lions, and ſwifter than Eagles;</hi> that is, they were exceeding ſwift. <hi>Our adverſaries were ſwifter than the Eagles,</hi> ſaid the poor captivated Church, when the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> came in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them (<hi>Lam.</hi> 4.19.) Read alſo <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.49. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 8.1.
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:48669:250"/> 
                     <hi>Hab.</hi> 1.8. <hi>Cicero</hi> the Orator, in his ſecond book of <hi>Divination,</hi> tells us, that when one who was to run a race, reported to an Interpreter,<note place="margin">Viciſti; iſta enim ave volat nulla vehemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tior. <hi>Cicer. l. 2.</hi> de divin.</note> that he <hi>dreamed he was turned into an Eagle;</hi> the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter preſently anſwered, <hi>Then you ſhall overcome,</hi> or get the maſtery: For the Eagle is the ſtrongeſt and ſwifteſt of all flying fowls.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Eagle exceeds all, as in ſwiftneſs, ſo in the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs of her flying: She flies right up; that's it which the Text takes notice of, <hi>She mounteth up;</hi> ſhe mounts up like an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row out of a bow,<note place="margin">
                        <p>Non obliquo tramite ut cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terae aves vel per gyrum ut accipiter, ſed recto ſurſum fertur. <hi>Aelian. lib. 14 c. 10.</hi> Aquila derem volatu ſuperat, &amp; ſublimius evadit. <hi>Oppi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.</hi>

                     </note> whereas other fowls, when they flie high, they do it obliquely, or ſide-long, by gyration, or fetching a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs; but the Eagle aſce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Thirdly, As the ſwiftneſs and uprightneſs of the Eagles mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo the highneſs of it is wonderful. The Eagle mounts till ſhe is quite out of ſight; no bodily creature can reach the Eagles altitude. One of the Ancients ſaith, The Eagle ſoars above the air (he means, I ſuppoſe the lower region of the air) as if ſhe would viſit the ſtarry heavens: And hence it is ſaid proverbially of any thing which we cannot eaſily reach or come at, <hi>'Tis an Eagle in the clouds.</hi> Her common attribute or epithete is, The high-flying Eagle.</p>
                  <p>If it be queſtioned, why doth the Eagle mount up ſo high? theſe two reaſons may be given of it;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That ſhe may come down, or ſtoop with greater force upon her prey; and that makes the Eagle ſo formidable to all the fowls of the air.<note place="margin">Aquila <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

And thus proud men deſire to get on high, that they may more eaſily make a prey of, and cruſh (as the Eagle doth) thoſe that are below them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Eagle mounts thus high to pleaſe her ſelf, 'tis ſutable to her ſpirit. Every one would be in action, as he is in diſpoſition. The Eagle hath a high ſpirit, and ſhe muſt flie high, and at high things. <hi>The Eagle will not catch flies;</hi> ſhe ſcorns that game. <hi>Doth the Eagle mount up</hi>
                     <q>At thy command?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Hebrew is, <hi>At thy mouth;</hi> ſo the word is rendred in
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:48669:250"/> ſeveral other Scriptures (<hi>Numb.</hi> 13.3.) <hi>And</hi> Moſes <hi>by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of the Lord ſent them from the wilderneſs of Paran;</hi> that is, he ſent the men that were to ſearch the Land; The He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew is, <hi>Moſes by the mouth of the Lord ſent them to ſearch the Land.</hi> Again (2 <hi>Kings</hi> 24.3.) <hi>Surely at the commandement of the Lord came this upon.</hi> Judah, <hi>to remove them out of his ſight, for the ſins of Manaſſeth.</hi> As if it had been ſaid, When the enemy made inrodes upon the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> how came this to paſs? ſurely at the command of the Lord, or <hi>at the mouth of the Lord,</hi> came this upon <hi>Judah.</hi> It is the word in the Text; <hi>Doth the Eagle mount up at thy command?</hi> or, <hi>at thy mouth?</hi> One would think, that it is not only the Eagles nature to mount up; there is ſomewhat in that, but that's not all, it is at the Lords mouth, at his command, and that we are ſpecially to take notice of here. What means this diſcourſe about the Hawk and Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, but to make us mount up our hearts to God, and acknowledge him in the motion of every creature? It is at Gods mouth that the Eagle mounts up; but what's the command that the Eagle receives from God? Doth not the Eagle mount up by a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral inſtinct, or according to the Law of nature planted in her? I anſwer, ſhe doth. Yet becauſe that natural inſtinct of the Eagle is of God, therefore we are to look upon the Eagle mounting up; as by a ſpecial order and command of God.

True believers have loweſt or lowlieſt ſpirits, yet higheſt and nobleſt aimes, not grovelling on nor bowing to the earth, but like an Eagle, mounting up on high: As this high flight of the ſoul is highly pleaſing unto God, ſo 'tis made by his ſtrength, and at his command. A believer flies high;</p>

                  <p>Secondly, As he flies high in his contemplation about, ſo in his love to, and deſire of high things; he doth not nakedly contemplate things above, as a Philoſopher may do, but he hath ſtrong affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to, and longings after the enjoyment and poſſeſſion of the things that are above; he is as much on high in his deſires and affections,<note place="margin">Non ad praece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptum hominis, aut ſuam ſolius voluntatem elevatur ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus ſed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>The Eagle doth not only mount on high (that may be from a ſudden overture or occaſion) but ſhe makes her neſt on high. The word which we render <hi>on high,</hi> ſignifies <hi>ſeparated,</hi> becauſe high places are places ſeparated from ordinary concourſe. Eagles co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet to make their neſts in places furtheſt remote from all acceſs both of men and beaſts. The beſt of high things, ſpiritual things, are ſeparated from this world, they are above the wiſdom and way of the world, and that's the reaſon why the world can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bear them. I touch that only from the notation of the word.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Eagle makes her neſt on high.</hi> But doth ſhe ſo, O <hi>Job,</hi> at thy command? doſt thou direct her, where to make her neſt or how? It ſeems the Lord teacheth birds to make their neſts. The leaſt bird is directed by God as well as the Eagle: It is by his counſel that ſome birds make their neſts very low, and that others (among which the Eagle eſpecially) make their neſts on high. <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith, no man can reach or touch the Eagles neſt.<note place="margin">Nidos ejsu nemo attigit, indificat in excelciſſimis rupibus. <hi>Plin.</hi> l. <hi>10.</hi> c. <hi>6.</hi>

                     </gap>nger, it ſpeaks thus (<hi>Jerem.</hi> 49.16.) <hi>Though thou ſhouldſt make thy neſt as high as the Eagle, I will bring thee down from thence, ſaith the Lord.</hi> 'Tis a proverbial ſpeech, and 'tis joyned with <hi>ſetting our neſt among the ſtars,</hi> in the 4. <hi>v.</hi> of the Prophecy of <hi>Obadiah.</hi> The <hi>Idumeans,</hi> with and about whom the Prophet there ſpake, dwelt in mountanous places, and ſlattered themſelves in the ſtrength and ſafety of the country, as if it had all been an Eagles neſt. The Eagle makes her neſt ſo high that 'tis, as it were, next to the ſtars. But why doth the Eagle make her neſt ſo high? there are two or three rerſons given of it, by the ſearchers of nature.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, For her ſafety, high things probably are moſt out of danger, there is a hight which is very dangerous, and there is a hight that is out of the reach of danger, ſuch is the height of the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles neſt.</p>
                  <pb n="480" facs="tcp:48669:252"/>
                  <p>Secondly, Naturaliſts ſay, the Eagle makes her neſt ſo high, becauſe ſhe cannot, without ſome difficulty, raiſe her ſelf from the earth; if ſhe ſits low, ſhe cannot eaſily mount up, ſhe hath a heavy body though a ſtrong wing: and therefore the wiſdom of God inſtructs her to make her neſt on high, that ſhe may with that advantage riſe out of it, and mount up from it. The Eagle doth not as the Oſtrich, lay her eggs in the duſt, or in the ſand, but ſhe makes her neſt in high places, that ſo ſhe may be both ſafe in her neſt, and the ſooner take her flight out of it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Eagle makes her neſt on high, becauſe there the air is pureſt, and ſhe is greatly delighted and pleaſed, with the purity and ſweetneſs of the air.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Gaudet ex hiſce ſpeculis coelum contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plari. <hi>Oppian.</hi>
                     </note>Fourthly, 'Tis ſaid alſo the Eagle makes her neſt on high, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe loves, from thence, as from a watch-tower, to behold and feed her eyes, upon the fair and beautiful face of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens.</p>
                  <p>In theſe four reſpects we ſhould be like the Eagle, and make our neſt on high. The Eagle doth not only mount high, but makes her neſt on high. Some men mount high, that is, have high notions and ſpeculations, in which they ſeem to be rapt up (as the Apoſtle once truly was) to the third heavens; yet they make not their neſt on high, they do not abide there, their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights are here below, and ſo is there neſt, the reſidence and reſt of their ſouls. The neſt of the rich mans ſoul, in the Goſpel, was in his full barns. O how many ſpeak high, diſcourſe high, profeſs highly, heaven-high; yet, when all's done, their neſt is upon the earth; They talk as high as the Eagle mounts, yet their neſt is as low as that of the O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>trich, in the duſt. Let us remember, as to mount high, ſo to make our neſt on high. The Apoſtle could ſay (1 <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.20.) <hi>Our conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation is in heaven;</hi> not only muſt we be ſpeaking high, but acting on high too; we muſt ſit and brood there, as the Eagle upon her neſt. Let us ſay of God, as <hi>Moſes</hi> the man of God did in his prayer (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.1.) <hi>Lord, thou haſt been our dwelling place in all generations;</hi> thou art ſo, and thou ſhalt be ſo for ever. Thus we are taught, not to imitate the fooliſh Oſtrich, building our neſt in the duſt, but like the noble Eagle (being lifted up by the mighty power of the holy Spirit) making our neſt or tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up our reſt in heaven, which is, as the higheſt, ſo the ſafeſt place of all.</p>

                  <p>The third thing ſpoken of in this context concerning the Eagle, is the choiſe of her abode or habitation.</p>

The word which we render <hi>abid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,</hi> ſignifieth properly <hi>tarrying for a night,</hi> or taking up a nights-lodging; but we are not to confine the Eagles abode to a night, to this or that night, here the word notes conſtant, continued re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence, <hi>ſhe dwelleth and abideth on the rock,</hi> there's her place, her palace, there this Queen of birds keeps Court, there ſhe abid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, excepting in two caſes.

Naturaliſts deſcribe a ſort of Eagles, which chuſe, and love to dwell in or inhabit woods, plains, and by the ſea ſhore; but the Eagle here deſcribed dwells on the rock, and not only ſo, but

                  <p>The <hi>Hebrew</hi> is, <hi>upon the tooth of the rock.</hi> Maſter <hi>Broughton</hi> renders, <hi>In the edge of a rock.</hi> The crag of a rock doth much reſemble both a tooth and the edge of a thing; for 'tis ſharp like an edge, and appears in form like a tooth: Now upon that part of the rock, which is moſt craggy and ſtands out like a tooth, there the Eagle abides, there ſhe pearcheth. And Naturalliſts tell us, though ſhe pearches upon a hard rock, yet ſhe is very careful of her talons, leaſt they ſhould be blunted or receive any injury from the hardneſs of the rock, ſhe is very curious of them, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of what uſe they are to her. Thus ſhe abides <hi>upon the rock, and upon the crag of the rock;</hi> or upon the tooth of the rock. It doth not ſatisfie the Eagle to build or abide upon any part of the rock, but ſhe chuſeth that part of it for her habitation which is moſt

                  <p>Note;
<q>Nature teacheth the creature in general, much more man, to provide for his own ſafety.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>That is, God hath put ſuch an inſtinct into the nature of all the creatures, as to provide for their own ſafety; The Eagle will dwell on the rock, ſhe will, not venture herſelf every where. And according to the ſtate and condition of creatures, ſuch is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion which they make for their ſafety (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.18.) <hi>The high hills are a refuge for the wild Goat, and the ſtony rock for the Coney.</hi> The wild Goats have their refuge, and the Coneys have their refuge, and they are taught whither to fly from the face of danger. There is no creature but hath a refuge in time of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and therefore we commonly ſay, <hi>Times of danger diſcover our refuge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="483" facs="tcp:48669:253"/>
                  <p>Now if the Lord hath taught the fowls of the air, and the beaſts of the earth to look to their own ſafety, to get to the rock, and the ſtrong place; then doubtleſs, he hath taught his ſervants, all that are godly, to ſeek and haſten to a refuge, both for their ſpiritual and corporal ſafety. <hi>David</hi> often diſcovers his refuge in the <hi>Pſalmes (Pſal.</hi> 18.2.) When at the firſt verſe, he had in plain language called the Lord his <hi>ſtrength, I will love thee, O Lord, my ſtrength;</hi> he preſently adds a number of metaphors, to ſhadow out the ſame thing, <hi>The Lord is my fortreſs, my rock, and my deliverer, my God, my ſtrength, in whom I will truſt; my buckler, and the horn of my ſalvation, and my high tower.</hi> He calleth God his rock twice in that verſe. God is not only a rock, but the only rock in which his faithful people find ſhelter. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid in his prayer (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.1.) <hi>Lord thou haſt been our dwelling place in all generations.</hi> Where do believers dwell? in God himſelf; as the dwelling of the Eagle is in the rock, ſo the dwelling of a believer is in God, his rock. They may be ſure of ſafety who are ſo houſed, who are houſed in God (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.1.) <hi>He that dwells in the ſecret places of the moſt high, ſhall abide under the ſhadow of the Almighty: I will ſay of the Lord, he is my refuge, and my fortreſs, my God, in him will I truſt.</hi> Thus, as the Lord hath taught the Eagle to look out a ſtrong place for her ſelf, ſo he hath taught his people; and it will be as much their wiſdom, to learn of the Eagle to provide againſt danger, as to learn of the Ant to provide againſt hunger.</p>
                  <p>As in this 28th verſe we have had the dwelling of the Eagle deſcribed, ſo in the next, we have both the ſharpneſs of her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite and the quickneſs of her ſight.</p>

                  <p>The fourth thing conſiderable in the Eagle, is the ſharpneſs of her appetite; ſhe hath a great heat of ſtomack, and a ſtrong di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, therefore ſhe muſt be ſeeking prey.</p>
                  <q>From thence.</q>
                  <p>That is, from the rock her dwelling place, from the tooth of the rock; <hi>From thence ſhe ſeeks her prey.</hi> And 'tis conceived, that the reaſon why ſhe builds ſo high is, that ſhe may from
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:48669:254"/> thence with more advantage ſpy out and ſeek her prey. The Hebrew is <hi>ſhe diggeth her prey</hi> from thence. That an Eagle ſhould dig, and dig in the air, is an elegant expreſſion. Diligent ſeeking or ſearching, is ſignified by digging in the Hebrew language. They that dig for a thing ſeek it earneſtly; and therefore to ſhew how earneſtly the Eagle ſeek her prey, ſhe is ſaid to dig for it. The Lord to ſhew the open ſinfulneſs of <hi>Iſrael</hi> told them (<hi>Jer.</hi> 2.34.) <hi>In thy skirts is found the blood of the ſouls of the poor innocents.</hi> That which is in a mans skirts is eaſily ſeen; and hence the Lord adds, <hi>I have not found it by ſecret ſearch,</hi> or as the Margin hath it, by <hi>digging;</hi> that's the force of the word, it notes a diligent ſearch or ſeeking; the Eagle ſeeks, as if ſhe were a digging for
<q>Her prey</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>What is her prey? The Eagle hath a ſtrong ſtomack, and the word here uſed ſignifies any thing eatable. Naturaliſts ſay ſhe feeds upon fowls of the air, the Dove, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhe feeds alſo upon Sheep, Lambs, Hares; and 'tis ſaid, ſhe hath a great mind to Hares, they being not only meat, but medicine to her. Naturaliſts tell us alſo, that the Eagle feeds upon fiſh, and that in her flight ſhe can diſcern the fiſh in the Sea: and ſome tells us, that ſhe loves ſhell-fiſh, the Crab-fiſh eſpecially very much; this is her prey: <hi>from thence ſhe ſeeks her prey,</hi> whither moving in the air, or upon the land, or in the water; ſhe ſeeks her prey where-ever 'tis to be had, and ſhe will have it if it be to be had above ground, yea, if it be to be had in the water.</p>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>Hunger makes active.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>We ſay hunger breaks thorough ſtone-walls or ſtrong-holds. Whither will not the Eagle dig to ſatisfie her appetite? I need not ſtay upon the general truth; I would only adde this, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſo in ſpirituals. Soul hunger, our hunger after righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs will make us active. Thoſe Eagles, the Saints, having a ſtrong appetite to the things of God, will dig for their ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they will ſeek after food for their ſouls till they are ſatisfied. Sometimes poſſibly there is a glut of food, and then they will ſcarcely look after it; but if once they are pinched with famine, then they look after food. That of the Prophet (<hi>Amos</hi> 8.11.)
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:48669:254"/> anſwers this of the Text, <hi>I</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>will ſend a famine among you: not a famine of bread, but of hearing the Word of the Lord.</hi> And what then? <hi>Why then they ſhall wander from ſea to ſea; and from the North even to the Eaſt, they ſhall run to and fro to ſeek the Word of the Lord, and ſhall not find it.</hi> The Eagle here ſeeks her prey &amp; gets it; but they ſhall ſeek the Word of the Lord, and not have it, becauſe they were unthankful for it, and unprofit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able under it, when they had it. 'Tis a ſad hunger to be pincht. with the want of the word, which is ſpiritual food; but that's a bleſſed hunger which is not from want of, but from a true and ſtrong deſire after the Word or ſpiritual food. True believers, abiding in a right frame, have a great deſire and hunger after ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual food, even when there is greateſt plenty of it; when there is (as we ſay) a glut of it, they are not glutted with it; the more they are ſatisfied with it, the more they would have of it; their appetites and ſatisfaction are interchangable; they are hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, yet ſatisfied; they are ſatisfied, yet hungry; and therefore they are always ſeeking their ſpiritual prey. It is a ſore judgment when they that have had much of this ſpiritual food, and have not had a hunger after it, are cut ſhort and deprived of it. The Lord often lets thoſe hunger after it in want, who have not hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gred after it in enjoyment.</p>
                  <p>As the Eagle hath an eager appetite, a ſharp ſtomack; ſo an excellent eye, a ſharp ſight, as it followeth.</p>
                  <q>Her eyes behold afar off.</q>
                  <p>To behold or ſee, is the work of the eye, and to behold afar off, is the excellency of the eye in that work. The Eagle ſeeks after her prey, and <hi>her eyes behold afar off.</hi> Some render <hi>which her eyes behold afar off,</hi> that's a good reading; the conjunctive particle <hi>and</hi> is not in the Original Text, and therefore we may ſupply it by the relative (which) as well as by the conjunction (and) Naturaliſts tell us, that the Eagle hath ſo ſharp a ſight, that when ſhe is mounted quite out of our ſight, out of the ſight of any man, and is as it were in the clouds, that even then ſhe doth perfectly behold her prey, and that is afar off indeed; even at that diſtance ſhe beholds the Hare in the buſh, and the fiſh in the water. There are almoſt incredible things related, as to the accuteneſs of the Eagles ſight; and the reaſon given by ſome of
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:48669:255"/> her quickſightedneſs, is this in nature, becauſe her eye lieth very deep in her head, and ſo hath a great advantage in ſeeing, the light being the more compaſſed by, and the rayes the more ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gathered into her eye. I ſhall not diſcuſs the validity of this reaſon, all agreeing in the thing, that the Eagle ſees very exactly and afar off: And as ſhe hath a very clear, ſo a very ſtrong ſight, ſo ſtrong that ſhe can ſteadily behold the Sun ſhining in its ſtrength (as it was toucht before) thoſe beams which blind us, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs our eyes, are pleaſing to hers. It hath been a torture which ſome Tyrants have uſed, to hold open a mans eye directly to the Sun-beams, and ſo blind him, and quite extinguiſh the ſight of his eye. Now that which blinds us, and puts out our eyes is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, delightful, and as ſome expreſs it, healing and refreſhing to the eyes of the Eagle: and hence 'tis ſaid of her, that ſhe tries her young ones, whether they be of a right breed or no, in this manner; ſhe holds them up to the Sun, and if they can bear the beams of the Sun with open eyes,<note place="margin">Phaebaea du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bios explorat lampede fatus. <hi>Silius Ital.</hi>
                     </note> they are right, otherwiſe ſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious. The Eagle is ſo ſharp-ſighted, that, <hi>An Eagles eye</hi> is the proverb for <hi>a ſharp ſight. Her eyes behold afar off.</hi> Not in the ſenſe we find the phraſe uſed (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 138.6.) where it is ſaid, <hi>Though the Lord be high, yet hath he reſpect unto the lowly, but the proud he knoweth afar off,</hi> that is, he regards them not. We put a word of that ſignificancy in the Meeter, <hi>He contemning, knows them afar off,</hi> that is, as perſons that he cannot abide to have near him. The proud and lowly are alike near in place to God, yet not in reſpect. But of that only by the way. The Eagles beholding things afar off, is not (I ſay) like the Lords beholding perſons afar off; thoſe things which are afar off, in place from the Eagle, ſhe ſees them as if they were at hand: Thus ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth afar off.</p>
                  <p>Hence, Obſerve;
<q>God hath given more excellent ſenſes to ſome ſenſitive crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures than to others of that kind, yea, than to thoſe of a higher kind, the rational.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Not only doth the Eagle exceed other fowls of the air, but all the men on earth in eye-ſight. And as an Eagle hath a natural eye-ſight beyond man; ſo a godly man hath a ſpiritual eye-ſight beyond all other men, the eye-ſight of faith, by which he ſees not only things afar off, but things inviſible, yea, him that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible,
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:48669:255"/> as <hi>Moſes</hi> did (<hi>Heb.</hi> 11.27.) A believer hath an Eagles eye; his eyes, as hers, <hi>behold afar off.</hi>

This Scripture of <hi>Job</hi> is alluded to by Chriſt himſelf (<hi>Mat.</hi> 24.28. <hi>Luke</hi> 17.37.) and both upon the ſame accounts, the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the glorious coming of Chriſt, and the end of the world. In <hi>Matthew</hi> he ſaith, <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the carcaſs is, there will the Eagles be gathered together:</hi> And in <hi>Luke, Whereſoever the body is, thither will the Eagles be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together.</hi> St. <hi>Matthew</hi> ſaith, <hi>Where the carcaſs is,</hi> and St. <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith, <hi>Where the body is.</hi> There are various interpretations of theſe two Scriptures, both quoted (as is generally conceived) from the Text under hand. Some expound them only of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the <hi>Jews</hi> by the <hi>Romans,</hi> and give the ſenſe thus; That whereas Chriſt had foretold the deſtruction of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> State and Temple by the <hi>Romans,</hi> and that it ſhould fall upon all places,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Dr.</hi> Hammond</note> even at once like lightning, ſo that it would be in vain for them to run from one City or Country to another, in hope to avoid the vengeance, becauſe whereſoever the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould be, or whitherſoever they ſhould retire to hide and ſave themſelves, thither would the <hi>Romans</hi> Armies come (whoſe Enſign was the Eagle) and finding them out, ſlay and deſtroy them. As if the Lord Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Thus the whole body of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation is compared to a carcaſs or body, and the <hi>Romans</hi> to Eagles. That
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:48669:256"/> ancient Prophecy (<hi>Deut.</hi> 28.49.) may be applicable to this fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal deſtruction of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation; <hi>The Lord ſhall bring a Nation againſt thee from far, from the end of the earth</hi> (as ſwift) <hi>as the Eagle flyeth, a Nation whoſe tongue thou ſhalt not underſtand.</hi>

                     </gap>t and be gathered to him whereſoever he ſhall appear? Taking the words in this latter ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>Some expound them of true believers gathering to Chriſt, as the carcsſe or body, every day by faith. One of the Ancients ſaith, when Chriſt being laid in the grave,<note place="margin">Euthymius. Theophila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus. Ambroſius.</note> was firſt reſorted to by <hi>Mary,</hi> the wife of <hi>Cleophas,</hi> and <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> the Mother of our Lord, and by the Apoſtles, then were the Eagles gathered about the carcaſs: And ever ſince Chriſt aroſe from the dead, believers have gathered together about him, and fed upon him as crucified, or as that bleſſed carcaſs who procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red life for them by his death; whereſoever <hi>Chriſt crucified</hi> is preached, thither true believers gather, and many who believe not are added to the Church.</p>
                  <p>Again, others expound it of the Saints gathering to Chriſt at the laſt day. Our late Annotators dealing with theſe words, as reported (<hi>Luk.</hi> 17.37.) ſay, that by the flight of the Eagle is ſignified the ſudden aſſembling of the Saints unto Chriſt coming unto judgement, anſwerable to that of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.52. as alſo to that, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.17.</p>
                  <p>Now though according to this allegorical interpretation of the Texts in St. <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Luke,</hi> Chriſt is the carcaſs, and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers the Eagles; yet I ſhall cloſe my interpretation of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s Text in <hi>Job,</hi> to which both the Evangeliſts allude, by ſhewing that in other Scriptures, ſuch things are ſpoken of Chriſt himſel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s</p>
                  <p>Firſt, As the Eagle is the royal bird, the Princeſs or Queen
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:48669:257"/> of birds, ſo Jeſus Chriſt is <hi>the Prince of the Kings of the earth (Rev.</hi> 1.5.) And again (<hi>Rev.</hi> 19.16.) <hi>King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.</hi> As the Eagle among birds, ſo Chriſt among both men and Angels, hath the preheminence.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As the Eagle mounts up, ſo alſo did Jeſus Chriſt (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.18.) <hi>Thou haſt aſcended on high;</hi> yea, ſo high hath Chriſt aſcended, that the Eagl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>annot follow him: The Heaven to which natural Eagles mount, is (as I may ſay) but a pavement to that which Jeſus Chriſt aſcended to Chriſt had a high ſlight, he mounted up to the heaven of heavens, far above all viſible heavens. (<hi>Eph.</hi> 4.10.) he is made higher than the Heavens (<hi>Heb.</hi> 7.26.)</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Hath the Eagle a piercing eye? ſo hath Jeſus Chriſt; he (not only from the height of the clouds, whither the Eagle mounts, but) from the higheſt heavens, can look into the ſecret of every mans heart, even into the hell of a bad mans heart, and ſee what's doing there, what's lying there. It was ſaid of Chriſt while on earth (<hi>John</hi> 2.25.) <hi>He needed not that any ſhould teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie of man, for he knew what was in man;</hi> and ſtill he looks quite through man, through the wiſeſt, cloſeſt, and moſt reſerved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the ſons of men. <hi>All things are naked and open before the eyes of him</hi> (this Eagle) <hi>with whom we have to do; his eyes behold afar off.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Hiſtorians tell us, the Eagle fights or wars with Dragons and Serpents, and overcomes them. Jeſus Chriſt, this Eagle, hath fought with that great dragon the devil, and bruiſed the head of the Serpent (<hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15.)</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, The Eagle is very tender and careful of her young ones. Now, <hi>as an Eagle</hi> (ſaith <hi>Moſes, Deut.</hi> 32.11, 12.) <hi>ſtirreth up her neſt</hi> (that is, thoſe in her neſt) <hi>fluttereth over her young, ſpreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings; ſo the Lord alone did lead him, and there was no ſtrange God with him. God bare the</hi> Iſraelites <hi>on Eagles wings</hi> (out of <hi>Egypt) and brought them to himſelf (Exod.</hi> 19.5.) that is, he brought them ſpeedily and ſafely, and ſo he bore them all the years of their journeying in the wilderneſs. The Eagle beareth her young ones upon her wings, that they may be ſafe (ſhe muſt be hurt before her young ones can, while ſhe bears them there.) Thus Chriſt bears his people on his wings, yea, in his boſome, <hi>The eternal God is their refuge, and underneath are the everlaſting Arms (Deut.</hi> 33.27.)</p>
                  <pb n="491" facs="tcp:48669:257"/>
                  <p>Sixthly, Naturaliſts tell us, the Eagle gives her young ones of her own blood,<note place="margin">Aelian. l. 14. cap. 14.</note> when ſhe cannot get other blood for them to drink or ſuck. This is moſt true of Chriſt; he ſuffered himſelf to be wounded for us; his hands and feet, yea, his very heart was pierced, that we might have his blood to drink in believing. <hi>My blood</hi> (ſaith he, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.) <hi>is drink indeed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Seventhly, The Eagle is long lived.<note place="margin">Aquila vocatur <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     </note> The Greek expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth her by a word ſignifying longevity; and ſome give the reaſon, not only from the excellent temperament and conſtitution of her body, but alſo becauſe ſhe lives in ſuch pure air, free from ill vapours and noiſom ſmells. Jeſus Chriſt is not only long lived, but he lives for ever, he was from everlaſting, and will be to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, he is <hi>the King eternal</hi> (1 Tim. 1.17.) <hi>the eternal father, (Iſa.</hi> 9.6.)</p>
                  <p>Thus we ſee how Chriſt is like the Eagle, in theſe ſeven par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars; I ſhall ſhew ſeven more, wherein true Chriſtians alſo are like the Eagle.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Doth the Eagle flie high? ſo do they by the wings of faith; <hi>They mount up</hi> (ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.31.) <hi>with wings as the Eagle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Hath the Eagle a clear ſight? doth ſhe ſee far off? ſo Saints by faith can ſee far off (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.17.) <hi>Their eyes ſee the King in his beauty, they behold the Land that is very far off.</hi> Which Scripture, though it be properly and litterally meant of beholding King <hi>Hezekiah</hi> in his earthly glory, yet it is much more verified of a believers ſeeing his King, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in his heavenly glory, and of his beholding Heaven, which may well be called the Land of <hi>farneſs and diſtances,</hi> or (as we tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate) <hi>The Land very far off. Stephen</hi> the Protomartyr, had a clear intellectual ſpiritual eye, when he ſaid (<hi>Acts</hi> 7.56.) <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I ſee the heavens opened, and the Son of man ſtanding on the right hand of God.</hi> Believers have a clear Eagle-eye here, and they ſhall have a much clearer eye hereafter, when they ſhall ſee Chriſt as he is (1 <hi>John</hi> 3.2.) All Saints will be more than eagle-eyed in glory.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Doth the Eagle dwell on a rock? ſo doth every true believer (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.16.) <hi>His place of defence ſhall be the munitions of rocks; bread ſhall be given him, his water ſhall be ſure.</hi> The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle tells us who the rock is (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4.) <hi>The rock which followed them was Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="492" facs="tcp:48669:258"/>
                  <p>Fourthly, Doth the Eagle renew her ſtrength? So do believers when any oldneſs is coming upon the new creature (as it doth ſometimes) then they renew their ſtrength by looking to Jeſus Chriſt, who is at once their righteouſneſs and their ſtrength: <hi>He ſatisfieth their mouth with good things, ſo that their youth is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed as the Eagles (Pſal.</hi> 103.5.) As the Lord often b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ings his people low by bodily ſickneſs and weakneſs, and then renews their natural health and ſtrength: So when there are decays and declinings upon their ſouls, he renews their ſpiritual health and ſtrength (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.31.) <hi>They that wait upon the Lord ſhall renew their ſtrengh,</hi> and then (as was ſaid before) <hi>they ſhall mount up with wings as Eagles.</hi> The Eagles youth is renewed by the growth and ſucceſſion of new feathers (of the ſame kind) in the place of the old; but a believer reneweth his youth or ſtrength, by caſting off gradually the remainders of the old man which is corrupt, and by putting on more of the new man (who is quite of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind) <hi>created after God in righteouſneſs and true holineſs (Eph.</hi> 4.24.)</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Can the Eagle look fully upon the Sun? Surely helievers have not only as clear, but as ſtrong a ſight as the Eagle, they can look upon Jeſus Chriſt the Son of righteouſneſs with open face. For as this Son of righteouſneſs hath ſaid, <hi>behold me, behold me</hi> (Iſa. 65.1.) and again, <hi>Look to me and be ye ſaved, all the ends of the earth</hi> (Iſa. 45.22.) that is, all ye that dwell on earth, even to the ends of it; ſo he gives a power, or a ſpiritual eye to behold and look upon him; and that beholding or looking is a healing to them, as the beholding of the Sun is to the natural eye of the Eagle (<hi>Mal.</hi> 4.2.) <hi>To them that fear my name ſhall the Son of righteouſneſs ariſe with healing in his wings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Do Eagles ſuck blood both young and old? ſo do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers. The firſt living of the new creature is upon blood; every godly man drinks the blood of Jeſus Chriſt by faith, as offered to him, both in the promiſes and in the Ordinances of the Goſpel. A believer could not live a moment, nor have any ſubſiſtence in grace, if he had not (as the Eagle) blood to ſuck in and drink. A godly man is nouriſhed, by a believing contemplation upon the ſufferings of Chriſt, and the effuſion of his blood.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, Doth the Eagle feed upon the ſlain? ſo believers feed upon Chriſt as ſlain. Chriſt by his death is become our food
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:48669:258"/> to eternal life, (<hi>Joh.</hi> 6.51, 53.) Though the raiſed and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified body of Chriſt be entred into the full poſſeſſion of a divine and eternal life, and though we by faith look to Jeſus Chriſt, not according to the fleſh, nor as dead, but as living and ſitting for ever at the right hand of the Father, there making interceſſion for us; yet we muſt look to him as entring into the holy place <hi>by the ſacrifice of himſelf,</hi> and with his own blood, <hi>not with the blood of others (Heb.</hi> 9.24, 25, 26.) The Apoſtle told the <hi>Corinthians, I determined to know nothing among you, but Jeſus Chriſt and him crucified;</hi> that is, ſo to know him as to feed upon him my ſelf, and ſo to make him known to you, that you might feed upon him alſo.</p>
                  <p>Further, It is conſiderable, that as believers in Scripture are compared to Eagles, and the Lord is ſaid to have born the old Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> upon Eagles wings; ſo under the Goſpel Eagles wings are ſaid to have been given to the Chriſtian Church, whereupon ſhe was born out of the reach of danger (<hi>Rev.</hi> 12.13, 15.) <hi>And when the Dragon ſaw that he was caſt to the earth, he perſecuted the woman that brought forth the man-child. And to the woman were given two wings of a great Eagle, that ſhe might flie into the Wilderneſs,</hi> (that is, convenient and ſufficient means to further her ſlight and retirement) <hi>into her place</hi> (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it is) <hi>where ſhe is nouriſhed for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the ſerpent.</hi> All the means of the Churches eſcape from danger are ſhadowed by <hi>two wings;</hi> not but that God hath more means than two, by which his providence works and procures the ſafety of the Church; but, becauſe it had been improper, ſpeaking of her flight, to expreſs more wings than two: For <hi>the Seraphims,</hi> which are deſcribed, having <hi>each one ſix wings (Iſa.</hi> 6.2.) yet two of them only were put to that uſe of flying. And theſe two wings given the Church, are ſaid to be the two wings <hi>of an Eagle,</hi> becauſe among all the winged tribes, Eagles are ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ongeſt and ſwifteſt of wing; they can fly faſteſt, and they can fly furtheſt, as in height, ſo in length. Nor are the wings given the Church, barely called the wings of an Eagle, but of a great Eagle, implying not only the beſt kind of wings, but the beſt wings of that kind; not only the wings of an Eagle, but of a great Eagle. By all which is meant, the wiſe and tender care of God over his Church in times of
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:48669:259"/> greateſt danger, when the Dragon become a Serpent, or the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine Dragon ſeeks moſt to annoy her.</p>
                  <p>Thus far the Lord hath been interrogating <hi>Job,</hi> not only about the inanimate creatures, the Heavens, the Air, the Sea, the Earth, but alſo about ſeveral Animals; in the leaſt of which, becauſe they not only have a being, but life, ſenſe and motion, more of the power, wiſdom and goodneſs of God ſhines forth, than in the greateſt of the former. And all the queſtions propoſed to <hi>Job</hi> in theſe two Chapters have (as hath been hinted heretofore, and ſhould be conſtantly minded) this general ſcope to convince (as then <hi>Job,</hi> ſo now) all men, both of their own nothingneſs, and of the all-ſufficiency, wiſdom, care and power of God, who hath ſo wiſely made, and doth ſo wiſely diſpoſe of all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which he hath made. And therefore, man who hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved more from God than they all, and of whom God is more ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der than of them all, ſhould ſubmit to the diſpoſe of God in all things without diſputing about, much more without murmuring at, or complaining of his diſpenſations in one kind or other.</p>
                  <p>The Lord (though he had done much in the way of interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating) hath not yet done interrogating <hi>Job</hi> concerning the works of his hands. Nevertheleſs, before he proceeded any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to enquire of him about the creatures, he ſaw it fit to feel his pulſe a little, by a cloſe application of what he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſaid, mingled with high language and cutting reproofs, thereby to try what effect this forepaſſed diſcourſe had wrought upon him, or whether he were come to a more humble and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting frame than before, as will appear in opening the former part of the <hi>Chapter</hi> following.</p>

                  <p>IN the two former Chapters we have heard what the Lord ſaid to <hi>Job</hi> out of the Whirlwind, with what queſtions he appo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him about the works of Creation and Providence: To all or any of which <hi>Job</hi> being unable to make Anſwer, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to give a preſent and perfect Anſwer, the Lord (it ſeems) gave him ſome little reſpite to recollect himſelf, in expectation of his Anſwer; but finding him ſilent, proceeds in this Chapter, to urge him yet further upon the whole matter, for an Anſwer; yea, the Lord having ſaid all this to him, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Is it wiſdom or inſtruction, or is that man well inſtructed, or well in his wits, who contends with the Almighty? The ſenſe of that reading is plain, and the improvement of it might be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry uſeful: for indeed theſe two are utterly repugnant and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riant,<note place="margin">Non eſt, ille e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruditus, neque bene obſequens divinae diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plinae, qui deo caſtiganti ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>To contend with God, and to be wiſe; to contend with God, and to ſhew our ſelves well taught.</hi> That man hath not received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction either by or about divine correction, who mutters or quarrels at God correcting him: For how wiſe ſoever he is in his own eyes, he ſhews himſelf a very fool, at leaſt, as to that point or attempt, very fooliſh. So then 'tis a great truth which this read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing holds forth, <hi>Is it wiſdom, is it learning, to contend with the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty?</hi> Whoſoever doth ſo, erres in doing ſo, and will at laſt both ſee and feel his errour by ſad experiences.</p>
                  <p>Secondly thus, <hi>Should he be inſtructed who contends with the Almighty?</hi> This Tranſlation may have a double interpretation.

Secondly, <hi>Should he be inſtructed, that contends with the Almighty?</hi> That is, is a learner a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent match for God? is one that needs inſtruction and teaching, fit to take up the bucklers and enter the field of diſpute with God?

                  <p>Thirdly, The word which we render to <hi>inſtruct,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Numquid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendet cum om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotente, quem ille caſtigat? <hi>Lavat.</hi>
                     </note> ſignifies al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to correct: taking it ſo, the Text is thus rendred, <hi>Shall he contend with the Almighty, whom he corrects;</hi> or, <hi>Shall a man corrected by or under the correcting hand of the Almighty, contend with him?</hi> Shall any give God words for his blows, or expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the matter with him?

                  <p>Laſtly (which was hinted in the ſecond) <hi>Doth not contending with the Almighty</hi> deſerve chaſtening? Certainly it doth; or, <hi>Is not chaſtening due to contending</hi> (that is, to contenders) <hi>with God?</hi>

                  <q>Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty, inſtruct him?</q>
                  <p>There is a twofold contending.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, By force and ſtrength of arm, or ſtrength of arms. We cannot ſuppoſe the Lord ſpeaking here of ſuch a Contention. There were a ſort of robuſtious men, Giants, of old,<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> called <hi>fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers with God;</hi> and many profane Atheiſts have blaſphemouſly ſet themſelves againſt heaven, as if they would pull God from his Throne. Such as theſe are not the Contenders with God here intended; <hi>Job</hi> was far from being a man of that ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Qui offert ſe diſputaturum cum eo. <hi>Aqu.</hi>
                     </note> There is a contending with God by force of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or by reaſonings. This I conceive is here meant; <hi>Job</hi> was often found in theſe contendings with God. But ſhall any think to <hi>logick</hi> it with God? to enter a diſpute with God? to argue with or reply upon him, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks (<hi>Rom.</hi> 9.20.) <hi>O man, who art thou that replieſt against God?</hi> Arguing and replying are a kind of contending, and this is of two ſorts;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, With the Word of God, declaring what God would have us do, or what God would have us believe. Thus many contend with God, even as many as ſubmit not to his Word. This is a common quarrel, whether the Word of God or mans will ſhall ſtand, whether the Law of God or the luſts of men ſhall
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:48669:261"/> carry it, and bear the ſway. The Apoſtle is expreſs in it (<hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7, 8.) <hi>The carnal mind is enmity againſt God;</hi> and if ſo, then it contendeth with God, for enmity will be contending; and what kind of contending is there meant, appears in the next words, <hi>it is not ſubject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.</hi> Every natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral man, till ſubdued and conquered by grace, is contending with the Word of God; he ſubmits not to what God would have him do, nor to what God would have him believe; he will not form either his faith or his life as God would have him. Infinite are the Contentions of man with God in this notion; but neither is this the contending here aimed at, and I would ſpeak to no more than is directly to the ſcope of the Text. Therefore</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There is a contending with the works of God, or with what God himſelf hath done or is doing. Thus alſo there are many Contenders with God in the world, and this is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention here ſpoken of; a Contention about the works of God, what God either hath done or is doing. All the debate which <hi>Job</hi> had with God, was about his dealings with him. God had laid him low, and ſtript him naked; God had broken his eſtate, and filled his body full of ſores and pains; God had wounded his ſpirit, and filled his ſoul with gall and wormwood; God had with-drawn hiimſelf or his comforts from him, and his friends were againſt him, or at beſt, but miſerable comforters were they all: Now though he was a patient man, yet under theſe preſſures he often broke out into impatient ſpeeches. Thus <hi>Job</hi> contended with the Almighty, <hi>Moreover the Lord anſwered</hi> Job, <hi>and ſaid; ſhall he that contendeth with the Almighty</hi> (about what he is doing)
<q>Inſtruct him?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Shall he have the better of him, and be able to teach him, or put him in a better way than he is in? Shall he give God the rule, the law how to guide the world more equally in general, or him in particular. Whether the Contention lieth about the providence of God to the whole world, or any Nation, family, or perſon, it comes under the ſame queſtion, <hi>Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty inſtruct him?</hi> That is, Can he direct God to do and order things better, or put them into a righter or more equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table courſe than they are diſpoſed in? No, he cannot. <hi>Who is the pleader</hi> (ſaith Mr. <hi>Broughton) that will inſtruct the Omnipotent?</hi>
                     <pb n="499" facs="tcp:48669:261"/> let him come forth and try his skill. Thus the Lord (yet in a tender and fatherly way) derides the folly of <hi>Job,</hi> who would needs attempt (upon the matter) to teach him who is perfect in knowledge, and to over-rule his decrees and determinations, who is not only, <hi>The Lord Chief Juſtice of all the World, but Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice it ſelf, and the ſole rule of it. Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty inſtruct him?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence obſerve;
<q>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> There is a ſpirit in man, in weak ſinful man, ready to contend with the Almighty God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The queſtion in the Text may be reſolved into this poſition, <hi>There are Contenders with God.</hi> There are Contenders with the Word of God (as was ſhewed before) There are Contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers alſo with the Works of God, or with God about his Works, as I ſhall ſhew further now; and this will ſoon appear, if we do but compare the 4th <hi>verſe</hi> of the 51th <hi>Pſalme,</hi> with the 4th <hi>verſe</hi> of <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. In the Pſalme <hi>David</hi> made Confeſſion of his ſin, of that ſpecial enormous ſin Adultery, with the Murder that follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it. <hi>Againſt thee onely have I ſinned, and done this evil in thy ſight, that thou m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For ſome poſſibly may ſay, with wonder, at the hearing of it, <hi>What! the Lord correct</hi> David? <hi>ſuch a man as</hi> David? <hi>ſo holy a man as</hi> David? <hi>ſo juſt and upright a man as</hi> David? <hi>Yes, and the Lord is juſt in doing it; and</hi> D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="500" facs="tcp:48669:262"/> with man; <hi>Let God be true, and every man a liar, as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; that thou mighteſt be juſtified in thy ſayings, and mighteſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome when thou art judged.</hi> In the Pſalme the words are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, <hi>That thou mayest be clear when thou judgest.</hi> But St. <hi>Paul</hi> following, as I remember, the Septuagint, renders them paſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>That thou mayest overcome when thou art judged.</hi> As if he had ſaid, Some take upon them to judge God (they who judge him, contend with him) that is, they judge and paſſe ſentence upon his works; now (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>Let God be true, and every man a liar, that thou mighteſt be juſtified in thy ſayings, and mighteſt overcome when thou art judged;</hi> that is, <hi>that all men may ſee and ſay thou art righteous, though thou afflicteſt the godly (for they ſin) and though thou condemneſt the wicked, for they ſin and repent not of their ſins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe two Scriptures conſidered either apart, or compared to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether (beſides many more which might be called into this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice) are a clear proof that there are Contenders with God about his works. Yet poſſibly ſome may ſay, ſurely there are none to be found ſo bold and preſumptuous; What contend with God?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, Firſt, There are ſome who do it very openly, avowedly, and with a bare face; they ſtick not to ſpeak their diſ-ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on concerning the works of God, and belch out blaſphemy againſt what he hath done, or is doing in the world. Such doubtleſſe were they, of whom it is ſaid (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.21.) <hi>They ſhall paſſe through it hardly beſtead and hungry; and it ſhall come to paſſe, that when they be hungry, they ſhall fret themſelves, and curſe their King and their God, and look upward;</hi> not in faith and patience, as they who in ſuch extremities call earneſtly and humbly upon God, but in paſſion and vexation, as they who wickedly curſe God, and depart from him. Such alſo are they ſpoken of (<hi>Rev.</hi> 16.9.) who being <hi>ſcorched with great heat at the pouring out of the fourth vial upon the Sun, blaſphemed the Name of God, who had power over thoſe plagues, and repented not, to give him glory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, I anſwer, There are many who do this ſecretly, or within their teeth; they bite in their words, yet 'tis the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of their hearts in tumultuating thoughts, ariſing and working there about the works of God: and thus a good man, a <hi>Job</hi> (who was a good man of the firſt form) may be found contending with the works of God. Any diſcontent with the works of God, is a
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:48669:262"/> degree of contending with God about them. Any ſecret riſing of heart againſt what God doth, is, in this ſence, a ſtriving with God; yea our being not fully pleaſed and ſatisfied with what God doth, is in ſome ſenſe a contending with God: And if all this be to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with God, how many are there that contend with God! and who almoſt is there that doth not? Who can ſay in this thing, my heart is clean? Who can ſay, but at one time or other, he hath contended with God. Remember, when we would have things after our mind and mode, when we are not free to comply with the will of God, this is to contend with God. There are two Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as to the common ſtate of the world, in which the hearts even of good men, are very apt to riſe againſt the work of God.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, When they ſee the wicked proſper, and carry all before them in the world; then they are ready to ſay, Why doth God ſuffer this? <hi>Jeremiah</hi> had much adoe to keep his heart from contending with God in this caſe (<hi>Jer.</hi> 12.1.) And <hi>David</hi> could hardly keep his from it (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.2, 3.) <hi>As for me, my feet were almoſt gone, my ſteps had well nigh ſlipt; for I was envious at the fooliſh, when I ſaw the proſperity of the wicked.</hi> And for this he befooled himſelf (<hi>verſ.</hi> 22.) <hi>So fooliſh was I, and ignorant; I was as a beaſt before thee.</hi> Thus <hi>David</hi> was, and many more have been offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the work of God, in giving good to bad men; and that's the firſt Caſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, When good men are vexed, oppreſſed, and trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den under feet, as mire in the ſtreets; what riſings of heart, and what unſatisfiedneſs of ſpirit is there in many good men! In both theſe Caſes there is much contending with God, though in both, our hearts (upon many accounts) ſhould acquieſce and reſt in the will of God; who, in the former, doth not declare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a friend to evil men; nor doth he in the latter, declare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf an enemy to thoſe who are good.</p>
                  <p>But ſeeing there is a ſpirit in man, even to contend with God; let us watch our ſelves in this thing, that ſuch thoughts riſe not: or let us carefully ſuppreſs them as ſoon as they are riſen. It is good for us, and our duty, to keep down the Contendings of our hearts with men, for we are very apt to be out with one another. 'Tis ſad to ſee breaches, the fruit of heart-burnings, between man and man. But much more ſhould we keep down thoſe contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, yea q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="502" facs="tcp:48669:263"/> about the works of God, for they may ſoon come to be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendings with him. For the cloſe of thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> point, take theſe four Conſiderations, which may move all ſorts of men to watch their hearts againſt Contendings with God, whether as to his dealings in the world, or with themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Remember, <hi>Whatſoever the Lord doth, he may do;</hi> for he is an abſolutely ſovereign Lord, and therefore not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with about any thing he doth, becauſe no way accounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for any thing he doth, as hath been ſhewed upon ſeveral oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions offered in opening this Book. He is Lord of our being, and <hi>hath given to all life, breath, and all things,</hi> as the Apoſtle told the ſuperſtitious <hi>Athenians (Acts</hi> 17.25.) and may not he do what he will to all beings, in whom all have their being; and who hath given all things to all which concern that being? He is our Maker, <hi>and hath not the potter power over the clay, to do what he will with it?</hi> Hath not the Creator power over the creature, to diſpoſe of it as he pleaſeth? (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.9.) <hi>Let the potſheard ſtrive with the potſheards of the earth.</hi> If any will be ſtriving, let them ſtrive with their like; potſheards with potſheards, not potſheards with the potter, to whom they are ſo unlike. The Lord uſed no other a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>gument but this to quiet all (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 46.10.) <hi>Be ſtill, and know that I am God;</hi> remember that, and you will either not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, or quickly have done contending with God: Yet in that Pſalm the Lord is repreſented making moſt dreadful work, <hi>Come, behold the works of the Lord, what deſolations he hath made on the earth.</hi> Though God make that which was as a garden, to become a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate wilderneſs, yet contend not with him; be ſtill, and know that he is God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Remember <hi>whatſoever work the Lord makes in the world, it is all righteous work<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>;</hi> there is nothing amiſs in it. <hi>He is a rock</hi> (ſaid <hi>Moſes,</hi> Deut. 32.4.) <hi>His work is perfect, for all his wayes are judgements</hi> (not as judgements are oppoſed to mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, but to injuſtice, as it followeth in that verſe) <hi>a God of truth, and without iniquity, juſt and right is he.</hi> To this <hi>David</hi> gives witneſs (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.17.) <hi>The Lord is righteous in all his wayes, and holy in all his works.</hi> Not only is he righteous and holy in this and that way or work, but in all his wayes and works; in wayes of judgement as well as in wayes of mercy, in wayes of deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction as well as in wayes of ſalvation. He is righteous in pulling
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:48669:263"/> down as well as in building up, in rooting up as well as in plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Now if there be a righteouſneſs in all the wayes and works of God, who ſhall contend with him about any of his wayes or works?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>All the works of God have an infinite wiſdom in them;</hi> they are done wiſely, even in exacteſt wiſdom; and ſhall we fools contend with him, who is not onely a wiſe God, but <hi>the God onely wiſe</hi> (Rom. 16.27.) and all whoſe works are done in, and according to the <hi>Idea</hi> or platforme of his own infinite and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal wiſdom. <hi>The fooliſhneſs of God</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.25.) <hi>is wiſer than men;</hi> that is, the wiſeſt men are meer fools to God; or that work of God, which ſome men call foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhneſs, is infinitely more wiſely done, than the wiſeſt work that the wiſeſt men in the world ever did, or can do, with all their wiſdome.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Let all that fear and love God, eſpecially, take heed of contending with God about any of his works; for God is good to all ſuch in all his works, and all his works are good to ſuch. Shall any contend with God about that which is for their own good? Not onely are thoſe works of God good to ſuch which are good in themſelves, that is, which we call good, being <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable providences,</hi> and for our comfort and ſupport in this world; but even thoſe works of God which we call <hi>croſs provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences,</hi> or providences which bring the Croſſe with them, are all good to ſuch, even to all them <hi>that love God; and are the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led according to his purpoſe</hi> (Rom. 8.28.) Shall they contend with God about any thing, who hear and may be aſſured, that he hath an intendment of good to them in all things? (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.1.) <hi>Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God is good to Iſrael;</hi> that is, though he afflicts them, and the Cup be very bitter which he gives them to drink, yet he is good to them. Or thus, Truly God, not the world (or though the world be not) is good to <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Once more, we may take the Pſalmiſt thus, <hi>Truly God is good to Iſrael,</hi> not ſo (as to them) to the world, though (as it followeth in the Pſalme) they enjoy ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo much worldly good.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Conſiderations may perſwade all not to contend with God about his works, to which I ſhall adde onely this counſel. If the works of God are grievous to us at any time, let us go the right way to work in our Contendings with him. For I do not urge
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:48669:264"/> this point, as if we ſhould ſit ſtill, and let <hi>the Lord alone</hi> (as he ſeemingly ſaid to <hi>Moſes,</hi> Exod. 32.10.) when he dealeth out hard and grievous things to us. There is a contending with God by ſupplication and prayer, by mourning and humiliation; this becomes us when the works of God are hard, when they are breaking, deſolating, ſcattering, and afflictive towards us. Take heed of diſcontent with providence, yet wreſtle and contend ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly with God by prayer, when providences go hard with you, or with the whole <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God. <hi>Moſes</hi> in a holy manner aſſault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God and contended with him in that caſe, and therefore the Lord ſaid to him (in the place laſt mentioned) <hi>Let me alone,</hi> as we ſay to a man that contends and ſtrives with us, <hi>Let me alone. Moſes</hi> was contending with the Lord about that diſpenſation, but it was in a gracious way: and ſo may we, yea ſo muſt we. The Lord expects prayer in all ſuch caſes, which if it be (as it ought to be) earneſt and fervent, is a ſtriving, a contending with him, very pleaſing and acceptable to him. When the providences of God were grievous to <hi>Jacob,</hi> and he feared they might be much more grievous to him, the Text ſaith he wreſtled with <hi>the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel;</hi> but how was that? the Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi> tells us (Chap. 12.4.) it was by <hi>weeping and making ſupplication.</hi> The Apoſtle uſeth the ſame expreſſion (<hi>Rom.</hi> 15.30.) <hi>I beſeech you brethren, that you ſtrive together with me in your prayers to God for me;</hi> that is, let you and I ſet our ſhoulders to it, wreſtling with God in the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of faith for mercy. This is a dutiful contending with God, a bleſſed ſtriving with God; Let us ſtrive ſo, and we ſhall (as <hi>Jacob</hi> did) prevail with God, and obtain the bleſſing. We may warrantably and confidently venture upon this contention with God; as for any other, take heed of it, ſo bear it, why ſhould we <hi>meddle to our hurt,</hi> as the King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> cautioned the King of <hi>Judah,</hi> when he would needs be contending with him (2 <hi>Kings</hi> 14.10.) The Lord may contend with us, and he will when we give him cauſe; yet he hath aſſured his people that he will not contend for ever, nor be alwayes wroth (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.16.) But we muſt <hi>humble our ſelves under his mighty hand alwayes</hi> (as the Apoſtle directs, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.6.) and not contend with him at all, unleſſe in the ſenſe and way laſt opened. It is as much our duty to let God do what he will, what he pleaſeth with us, patiently, as to do readily whatſoever his will and pleaſure is.</p>
                  <pb n="505" facs="tcp:48669:264"/>
                  <p>Secondly, In that the Text ſaith, <hi>ſhall he that contendeth with the Almighty inſtruct him?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Obſerve;
<q>They who contend with God, or are diſcontent with the works of God, ſeem to themſelves able to inſtruct and teach God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>That's the thing at the bottom which the Lord would convince <hi>Job</hi> of. Diſcontented perſons ſeem to ſay unto God, they could put things into a better way, if they had the handling of them; or that they could model the government of the world more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually, if it were in their hands. Such is the pride and ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or the ſinful pride of mans heart, that he thinks himſelf able to inſtruct God, and teach him to mend his work. Some have been ſo arrogant and preſumptuous, as to ſay, they could have mended ſome things in the natural fabrick of the world, had they been the contrivers of it; and many have ſaid, at leaſt in their hearts (where the fool ſaith there is no God) that they could mend the providential fabrick or courſe of it. Beware of theſe preſumptions. Remember, it is our duty to be inſtructed by God, to receive inſtruction from God. Wo to thoſe who would give him inſtruction (<hi>Job</hi> 22.22.) <hi>Acquaint thy ſelf now with him, and receive the law at his mouth,</hi> that is, the rule of all thy actions, but do not give the law to him. No man hath mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e need of inſtruction than he who thinks he can give inſtruction to God. It is ſaid proverbially, when we ſee an inferior, much more a ſmatterer in any Art or Science, offer to controule a perfect Artiſt; What, <hi>A Sow or a Swine teach Minerva!</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Sus minervam.</note> how much more may we ſay ſo of the moſt learned, that controule God or contend with him about his works! The works of God of every kind are ſo exact in every kind, that it is impoſſible to find any real defect or redundancy in them. To go about to mend them, is to marr them; to alter them, were to deface them. Thoſe things which men call or count the blemiſhes of Gods works, are the true beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of them; and what they contend with him about, is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of them, and the glory of his workmanſhip. And as at laſt Jeſus Chriſt will <hi>Preſent</hi> the whole body of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, or the perſons of all that believe, <hi>to himſelf a glorious Church, not having ſpot or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing (Eph.</hi> 5.27.) ſo he will at laſt repreſent the providences of God, or his
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:48669:265"/> works of providence, both in the Church and all over the world, without ſpot or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing. Only here will be the difference, the Church will be preſented not having ſpot or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing (ſhe hath had her ſpots and wrinkles, and many ſuch things) But the works of God ſhall then be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, as never having had any ſpot or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing; that is, then it ſhall be made appear, that they were always with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpot or wrinkle, altogether juſt, righteous and perfect.</p>
                  <p>Further, From the whole ſentence, in that here we have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation of mans contending with God, and preſuming to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct him, take theſe two inferences from it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt;
<q>There is much pride in the heart of man.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>There would never be any contending with God, were there not much pride in the heart of man; <hi>For</hi> (Prov. 13.10.) <hi>only by pride cometh contention:</hi> If ſo, then, where no pride is, there is no contention. There are indeed ſeveral other occaſions of contention; ſome out of covetouſneſs, others out of malice, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with their neighbours, yet all may be reſolved into this, the pride of mans heart; pride bears part with all the occaſions and cauſes of contention. It ſhould be matter of great humiliation to us, that our hearts are proud at all; but that they riſe even to ſuch a hight of pride as produceth contention, and trying Maſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries (as it were) with God himſelf, how ſhould that humble us. And if to contend with man, our equal, be a ſymptome of pride, what is it to contend with God, who is infinitely above all men!</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Take this Inference from it.</p>
                  <q>There is a great deal of folly bound up in the heart of man.</q>
                  <p>If man were not vain and fooliſh? he would not willingly do any thing, that ſhould have the leaſt ſignification of a contention with God, much leſs that which can ſignifie nothing elſe. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>fools will be medling;</hi> it is higheſt folly to be thus medling with Gods matters. Again, it is a ſufficient proof of our igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and folly, to attempt (in any way) to inſtruct God or teach him, either what to do or how to do, either when to do or in what meaſure to do, or towards whom to do any of his works; but they who are unſatisfied with the works of God, and in that ſenſe
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:48669:265"/> contend with him about them, make an attempt always in ſome of theſe reſpects, ſometimes in all of them, to inſtruct and teach him: Is not their folly manifeſt to all men, who are not as fooliſh as themſelves? <hi>Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty inſtruct him?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>He that reproveth God let him anſwer it.</q>
                  <p>This ſecond part of the verſe is of near alliance to the former. Contending with God, is indeed a reproving of God: Theſe two Acts expound each other yet more diſtinctly, <hi>to reprove</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The finding of a fault.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, A rebuke given for that fault. There muſt be a fault found, elſe we cannot juſtly reprove;<note place="margin">Qui vult Deum arſuere, aut cum Deo diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tare, reſponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at ad unum aliquod eorum, quae in medium attuli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> and a fault being found we may juſtly rebuke the fault. So then, to reprove God implies a finding of a fault with Gods works, and then a kind of rebuk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God for that fault; and if all this be in a reproof, rhen to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove God for any of his works, is a daring work indeed. I grant the word rendred <hi>reprove</hi> may be taken in a milder ſence, <hi>He that argueth or pleadeth with God;</hi> Our reading hightens the ſenſe of the Hebrew word, or takes it in the higheſt ſenſe, <hi>he that reproveth God</hi>
                     <q>Let him anſwer it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>That is;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Let him anſwer the former queſtion, whether he be able to inſtruct God or no, or (according to the other reading) whether he doth not deſerve puniſhment for contending with God?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Let him anſwer it,</hi> that is, let him anſwer all thoſe queſtions propoſed in the two former <hi>Chapters.</hi> As if God had ſaid, Job, <hi>thou haſt reproved my works, yet canſt not anſwer my queſtions.</hi> So Maſter <hi>Broughton</hi> carrieth the ſenſe; <hi>Let the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prover</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of the puiſſant ſpeak to any one of theſe things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Let him anſwer it,</hi> that is, let him anſwer for ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, let him bear his puniſhment. There is a two-fold anſwering; Firſt. A Logical anſwering. Secondly, A Forinſecal anſwering. Or there is an anſwer in Schools, and an anſwer in Courts.</p>
                  <pb n="508" facs="tcp:48669:266"/>
                  <p>And anſwer in Logick is made three ways. Firſt, <hi>By denying.</hi> Secondly, <hi>By granting.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>By diſtinguiſhing</hi> or limmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the propoſition and matter propoſed. Logicians in Schools anſwer by denying, or by granting, or by diſtinguiſhing. The diſtinguiſher grants ſomewhat, and denies the reſt.</p>
                  <p>An anſwer in Law, if the matter be criminal, is made by pleading guilty or not guilty to the Inditement. If the matter be civil, to anſwer, is to ſhew our right, to take off the charge, or defend our title. There is alſo an anſwering in Law by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting, and that two ways. Firſt, By ſubmitting to the mercy of the Court. Secondly, To the penalty of the Law.</p>
                  <p>Now, when the Lord ſaith in the Text, <hi>Let him anſwer it;</hi> I conceive we may take it not only in a <hi>Logical ſenſe,</hi> let him anſwer it (if he can) by reaſoning, but in a <hi>Court ſenſe,</hi> let him anſwer it by bearing the penalty of his raſhneſs and folly; as we ſay to one that hath wrong'd us, <hi>It ſhall coſt you dear, you ſhall anſwer it:</hi> I conceive (as was ſaid) we may underſtand it here both ways. <hi>Let him that reproves God</hi> anſwer it, either as a diſputant in Schools, or as a defendant in Courts of Law; and if he cannot anſwer it as a Logician, by giving a reaſon for what he hath done, he ſhall certainly anſwer it in Court, by undergoing the penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Law, for what he hath done.</p>
                  <p>Some tranſlate thus, <hi>He that argues with or reproves God, ought to anſwer it;</hi> that is, he muſt not think it enough to put in a charge or to give a reproof, but he muſt make it good. He that reproveth a man ought to give a ground of his reproof; how much more he that reproveth God! The Text concludes it ſhould be ſo, yea, that it ſhall be ſo. <hi>He that reproveth God let him anſwer it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note, Firſt;
<q>'Tis dangerous, 'tis at our peril, to find fault with what God doth.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He that doth ſo, muſt and ſhall anſwer it; there's no avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. There are two ſorts of reproving which are our duty. Firſt, The reproving of other men, when we have an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and a call (<hi>Levit.</hi> 19.17. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.1.) As all they who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove God ſhall anſwer it; ſo many ſhall anſwer it, becauſe they have not reproved men. Secondly, It is a duty to reprove our ſelves, and a great point of wiſdom to ſee what is reproveable
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:48669:266"/> in our ſelves. Many are quick-ſighted at finding faults in others, but very blind as to finding out their own. I may adde, it is both a great duty, and a ſign of much grace, meekly to take and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a reproof from others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now, as it is our duty to take a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof from others, when we have failed, and to ſee our own faults and reprove our ſelves for them; as alſo wiſely to reprove others for the faults we ſee in them, ſo it is our ſin, danger and peril, to reprove God, in whom there is no fault, nor can be. And if any ſay, we never had a thought of reproving God, know, if you find fault with the works of God, you reprove God; to find fault with what God hath done to you, or your relations, is to reprove God, and this you muſt anſwer, or anſwer for it.<note place="margin">Nemo in offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na audet repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendere fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brum; &amp; audet homo in hoc mundo repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendere Deum? <hi>Auguſt.</hi> in <hi>Pſal. 145.</hi>
                     </note> Will a Maſter in any Art, endure that an ignorant perſon ſhould find fault with his work? how then will the Lord take it, if men ſhall come into his great ſhop, the world, and find fault with this and that, and the other work of his? There is no temptation that Satan our great enemy doth more follow us with, than this, even to make us find fault with the works of God. There are theſe two things about which Satan labours much; Firſt, to keep us from finding out the faults of our own works, which are almoſt nothing elſe but faults. Satan would perſwade us that we have done all well, when we have done that which is altogether evil, or ſtark naught for the matter of it, and how doth he hinder us from ſeeing our faults, in the manner of our doing good works! he would not ſuffer us to have the leaſt ſuſpicion that we may have done evilly, while we have been doing good. Secondly, Satans great buſineſs is to put us upon finding faults (where none are) in Gods works. Almoſt all the murmurings of the ſons of men, ariſe from this miſconceit in man, that there is ſomewhat amiſs in the works of God towards them, or that he hath not dealt well and wiſely with them. This falſe and blaſphemous principle Satan would plant and water in the hearts of all men, as he did (to the overthrow of mankind) in the heart of the firſt man: <hi>This, this is his work;</hi> and he hath got a great victory over that ſoul, who either ſees not the faults of his own works, or finds fault with the works of God.</p>
                  <p>Further, theſe words, <hi>Let him anſwer it,</hi> may imply the Lords gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs and mildneſs in ſpeaking to <hi>Job.</hi> The Lord doth not thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der againſt him, but ſaith, come let me ſee what you can anſwer,
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:48669:267"/> let me hear what you can ſay in favour of your ſelf, either to ſhew the equity of what you have ſaid in reproving me, or any ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity in what I have done in afflicting you; I give you free leave to ſpeak for your ſelf. Some inſiſt much upon this ſenſe, and it may yield us this note;
<q>God is very gracious in condeſcending to man.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He is willing we ſhould anſwer for our ſelves, and do our beſt to clear our ſelves, when we have done our works amiſs, or have ſpoken amiſs of his.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>There are two other tranſlations of theſe words; whereof, the one refers to the ſpeeches, the other to the actions of <hi>Job.</hi>

<pb n="514" facs="tcp:48669:269"/> ſhould know our ſelves leſs (valuingly) In which ſenſe <hi>Job</hi> ſaid (<hi>Chap.</hi> 9.21.) <hi>Though I were perfect, I would not know my ſoul.</hi> It is our ignorance, who and what we are, which cauſeth us to have high thoughts of our ſelves; as it is our ignorance, who and what Chriſt is, which cauſeth us to have ſuch low thoughts of him, and ſuch ſlow or ſlight deſires after him (<hi>Joh.</hi> 3.10)</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As becauſe we are vile, we ſhould take heed of prizing our ſelves much, ſo we ſhould more <hi>take heed of being proud of our ſelves at all.</hi> Indeed where the former is, where any perſon, man or woman ſets too high a price upon ſelf, it is very hard to abſtain from pride in ſelf; for, <hi>pride in ſelf, ariſes from over-prizing of ſelf:</hi> We firſt think too well of our ſelves, and then are lifted up in our ſelves. As it is through the power of faith, that our hearts are lifted up to God and in God; ſo when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever our hearts are lifted up in our ſelves (glorying in our own attainments) or to our ſelves (gaping after our own ends) it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from pride.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, See the exceeding goodneſs of God, who hath put honour upon vile man. We have made our ſelves vile, and ſo we ſhould reckon our ſelves; yet the Lord is pleaſed to eſteem his people highly, and make them honourable (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.4.) <hi>Since thou waſt precious in my ſight, thou haſt been honourable. Job</hi> was vile (as he confeſſed) in his own ſight, yet he was precious in Gods ſight. And thus the Lord eſtimates all that are godly, all that are true believers; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hough vile and of no value in themſelves, nor in their own ſight, yet precious they are in his ſight; <hi>Since thou waſt precious in my ſight thou haſt been honourable.</hi> We are never truly honourable, till precious in the ſight of God. There is a <hi>bubble</hi> which the world calls <hi>honour,</hi> a wind of fame, with which many are much affected, and with which ſome are inveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who are not at all precious in the ſight of God. The beſt, the trueſt honour, ariſeth from preciouſneſs in the ſight of God; they who are eſteemed by God, are indeed perſons of eſtimation. His grace ſhewed favourably and freely to us, his grace working mightily and effectually in us, puts a bleſſed worth upon us, though we are vile in our ſelves, and ſo accounted by the world.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, See the goodneſs of God in this alſo, that though we are vile, yet he is pleaſed <hi>to ſet his heart upon us, and to mind us.</hi> We little mind <hi>vile things;</hi> light things, trifles, we lightly
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:48669:269"/> paſs by. We are but a light thing, a vile thing in our ſelves, yet God not only hath us in his heart, but ſets his heart upon us. Thus ſpake <hi>Job</hi> in the loweſt ebbe of his outward felicity, and he ſpake it admiringly as well as truly (<hi>Chap.</hi> 7.17) <hi>What is man, that thou ſhouldſt magnifie, and that thou ſhouldſt ſet thine heart upon him!</hi> When he ſaith, <hi>What is man?</hi> it is as it he had ſaid, <hi>Man is but a vile thing;</hi> yet the Lord is mindful of him, yea, magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth him. And though the Lord forbids us to ſet our hearts or affections on earthly things (<hi>Col.</hi> 3.2.) on the beſt of earthly things, all which are comprehended under that one word or title, <hi>Riches (Pſal.</hi> 62.10.) And though the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why he forbids us to ſet our hearts upon theſe things, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e vile, yet he is pleaſed (O infinite goodneſſe!) to ſet his heart upon us though we are vile, and conſidered as ſinful, much more vile than they, even than the vileſt of them. We have the like queſtion put again (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 144.3.) <hi>Lord, what is man that thou takeſt knowledge of him, or the ſon of man, that thou mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt account of him?</hi> What is man! 'Tis a diminiſhing queſtion, implying, <hi>that man is a vile thing,</hi> or a nothing. Is it not then a wonderful thing? is it not the fruit of rich and free grace, that God ſhould take an account, or make ſuch an account of man? And if God ſets his heart upon man, who is ſo vile, how ſhould man ſet his heart upon God, who is ſo infinitely excellent! God may be ſaid to deſcend, ſurely he condeſcends exceedingly, when he ſets his heart upon vile man. <hi>The Lord humbleth himſelf</hi> (ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 113.6.) <hi>to behold</hi> (that is, to take any notice of, or to take into his conſideration) <hi>the things that are in heaven, and in the earth;</hi> how much more doth he deſcend, condeſcend and humble himſelf, when he ſets his heart upon vile man! Now, doth God ſet his heart upon vile man (which is an humbling to him) and ſhall not vile man ſet his heart upon the great and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious God, which is not only his duty, but his felicity, his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and exaltation!</p>
                  <p>Again, <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>I am vile.</hi> What was <hi>Job?</hi> a godly man ſure, a holy man by Gods own teſtimony, yet even he ſpeaks at this low rate of himſelf, <hi>Behold, I am vile.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="516" facs="tcp:48669:270"/>
                  <p>Hence note, Secondly;
<q>The better we are, the leſs we eſteem our ſelves; and ſtill the better and better we grow, the lower are our thoughts of our ſelves.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is no greater argument of height in grace, than low thoughts of ſelf. Next to faith in Chriſt, ſelf-denial, or to deny our ſelves, is the great duty of the Goſpel (<hi>Mat.</hi> 16.24.) Now, as to <hi>deny our ſelves</hi> is to be very low in our own eyes, ſo it is one of the higheſt acts of grace in us, and requires not only truth of of grace, but much ſtrength of grace to act it. And hence it comes to paſs, that the higher and ſtronger any are in grace, they are ſtill lower and leſſer in their own ſight, bacauſe true height and ſtrength of grace works the ſoul to more ſelf-denial. And therefore, as a godly man is vile, ſo he is made more ſenſible of his own vileneſs, the more he encreaſeth in godlineſs; ſo that, if any have low thoughts of him, he hath lower of himſelf. None can think him lower in truth, than he thinks himſelf; I am light, ſaith he, I am vile. Though he well underſtands his ſtate, his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge, and his intereſt in Chriſt through grace, and underſtands it ſo well, that he values it above all the world, and would not part with it for the whole world, yet he is ſtill vile in his own eyes, and low in his own rate-books. <hi>Abraham,</hi> the chief of believers, ſaid (<hi>Gen.</hi> 18.27.) <hi>Behold, now I have taken upon me to ſpeak unto the Lord, who am but duſt and aſhes.</hi> So <hi>David</hi> (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.18.) <hi>What am I? and what is my fathers houſe, that thou haſt brought me hitherto?</hi> How ſenſible was he of his own vileneſs, who ſpake thus, who yet was a man after Gods own heart, and the beſt of Kings?</p>
                  <p>Further, Conſider the time when <hi>Job</hi> was brought to this hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble confeſſion and acknowledgement of his own vileneſs; he had not ſpoken thus before, but was much in juſtifying himſelf, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as to the ſincerity of his heart and wayes, and he did it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to offence; but the Lord having dealt roundly with him, he cryes out, <hi>I am vile.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="517" facs="tcp:48669:270"/>
                  <p>Hence, Obſerve;
<q>The dealings of God with man aime moſtly at this great mark, to humble him, and to make him ſee his own vileneſs.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>We quickly ſee, or are quick-ſighted to ſee and take notice of any good in us, or done by us, to make us proud inſtead of thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; but we are dull of ſight to ſee or take notice of that in us, or done by us, which may humble and lay us low: And therefore we put God to it to ſhew us our vileneſs, by ſevere and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling diſpenſations. There are two great things which God would bring man to. Firſt, To make him know how vile he is. Secondly, To make him know how excellent, how glorious him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is. The Lord never left battering <hi>Job</hi> by afflictions, and following him with queſtions, till he brought him to both theſe points; <hi>Behold I am vile</hi> (ſaith he in this place) <hi>I know thou canſt do every thing, and that no thought can be with holden from thee,</hi> ſaid he afterwards (<hi>Chap.</hi> 42.2.) in which words he high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exalted God, in the glory both of his power and wiſdom. As one great purpoſe of the Goſpel is to exalt man and lift him up unto a moſt glorious condition in and through Chriſt; ſo another great purpoſe of the Goſpel, is to lay man low in himſelf, or to take him quite off from his own bottome. The Apoſtle often inſiſts upon that, as one grand deſign of the Goſpel with reſpect to man (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.26.) <hi>Ye ſee your calling brethren, that not many wiſe men after the fleſh,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>are called.</hi> He tells us at the 29th verſe why it is ſo, <hi>Even that no fleſh ſhould glory in his preſence;</hi> But (<hi>ver.</hi> 31.) <hi>that according as it is written, he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.</hi> All the dealings of God, both in Law and Goſpel, both in his providences and in his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, tend to bring man off from, and out of himſelf; and till that be effected, neither ordinances nor providences have their due effect upon him. We muſt come to <hi>Jobs</hi> acknowledgment, <hi>that we are vile,</hi> that we are nothing, and that God is all to us in Chriſt, before we are Chriſtians indeed.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The former diſcourſe ſheweth, that God was come very near to <hi>Job, he ſpake to him out of the whirl wind,</hi> his appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance was very dreadful: And then <hi>Job</hi> cryed out, <hi>Behold I am vile.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="518" facs="tcp:48669:271"/>
                  <p>Hence Obſerve;
<q>The more we have to do with God, and the nearer God comes to us; the more we ſee, and the more we are made ſenſible of our own vileneſs.</q>

                     </note>Man is clearly diſcovered and known to himſelf, when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds God in the ſhinings of divine light, and not till then. <hi>Job</hi> was higher in his own thoughts than became him, till God came thus near to him; and when God came yet nearer to him, and diſcovered himſelf (as he afterwards did) yet more fully to him, then <hi>Job</hi> did not only ſay (as here) <hi>I am vile,</hi> but <hi>I abhor my ſelf, and repent in duſt and aſhes.</hi> This firſt approach of God in ſo eminent and illuſtrious a way or manner, wrought much upon him, but the ſecond more. The light of God ſhews us our darkneſs, the power of God our weakneſs, his wiſdom our folly, his purity our uncleanneſs, his Majeſty our vileneſs, and his Allneſs or alſufficiency being ſeen, gives us to ſee our utter defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency and nothingneſs. Still in proportion to the nearneſs of God to us, or our nearer and clearer apprehenſions of him by faith, we are carried further out of, and further off from our ſelves; and thus 'tis in our attendance upon God in the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of worſhip. The reaſon why many come to ordinances with proud hearts, and go away proud, is, becauſe they have little or no communion with God in them by faith, or God doth not mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt himſelf to them by his bleſſed Spirit. They who have <hi>ſeen the power and glory of God in the Sanctuary</hi> (as <hi>David</hi> profeſſed he had ſometimes done, and longed to ſee it again (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.1, 2.) they will ſay with the ſame <hi>David (Pſal.</hi> 131.1, 2.) <hi>Lord, our heart is not haughty, nor our eyes lofty, our ſoul is like a weaned child.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>Job</hi> was waiting for the goodneſs of God to him, or for deliverance out of his ſad condition; and doubtleſs he was convinced, that the moſt probable way to it, was to leave off con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending with God, and to be found humbling himſelf before him, in this or a like confeſſion, <hi>Behold, I am vile.</hi>

                  <pb n="519" facs="tcp:48669:271"/>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>There is nothing that doth more ſweeten and molifie God (or, I may ſay, any ingenuous adverſary) towards us, then an humble acknowledgement of our own vileneſs and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>When our hearts are truly humbled, mercy and deliverance are at hand. <hi>Job</hi> was no ſooner made deeply ſenſible of his vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but mercy came in. The only skill of this <hi>excellent wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi> (as one calls him) was to caſt himſelf down at Gods foot. There is no way to get within God and to prevail with him,<note place="margin">Sciebat <hi>Jobus</hi> contra ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum humilem inermem eſſe Dei manum.</note> but by ſubmitting to him. The Lord layeth down his rod, when we lay down our pride; and caſts his ſword out of his hand, when we caſt our ſelves at his feet. And in all our afflictions, whether perſonal or national, till we acknowledge (not formally, but in a deep ſenſe of our own vileneſs) that we are vile, in vain do we cry for deliverance, or hope for mercy. When we are loweſt in our own eyes, we are neareſt to our exaltation; when once we ſay in our hearts we are nothing, we deſerve nothing, we have ſpoken lightly, we have done lightly, ſalvation will not tarry. (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.7.) <hi>Humble your ſelves under the mighty hand of God, and he will lift you up in due time.</hi> If we would be lifted up out of any affliction, we muſt be at this humbling work. We ſhall never work (as I may ſay) upon the heart of God, unleſs we are thus at work with our own hearts, or till this work be done upon our hearts. Our great work lies within, eſpecially in a day of tryal and tribulation, ſuch as <hi>Job</hi> was in. <hi>Job</hi> was ſpeedily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to his former honour and greatneſs, when once (through grace) he had wrought his heart to this confeſſion. <hi>Behold, I am vile;</hi>
                     <q>What ſhall I anſwer thee?</q>

                  <p>As if <hi>Job</hi> had ſaid, <hi>truly I have nothing to anſwer thee; Thou, O Lord, haſt given ſuch demonſtrations of thy greatneſs, of thy power, of the excellency of thy wiſdom, of thy goodneſs, that I have nothing to ſay,</hi> but this, that I can ſay nothing. <hi>What ſhall I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer thee?</hi> I know not what to anſwer, or I have nothing to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. As in a great ſtrait, when we know not what to do, we uſually ſay, <hi>What ſhall we do?</hi> So here, it ſheweth that <hi>Job</hi> was
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:48669:272"/> no way able to anſwer, when he ſaid, <hi>What ſhall I anſwer?</hi> The Hebrew is, <hi>What ſhall I return</hi> or <hi>turn back?</hi> We may exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifie this paſſionate interrogation, by that of the Patriark <hi>Judah (Gen.</hi> 44.16.) when <hi>Joſeph</hi> would have detained <hi>Benjamin</hi> (having found the cup in his ſacks mouth) <hi>Judah</hi> ſaid, <hi>What ſhall we ſay unto my Lord? what ſhall we ſpeak? or how ſhall we clear our ſelves?</hi> Here are three queſtions to ſhew that he had nothing to anſwer. Firſt, <hi>What ſhall we ſay to my Lord?</hi> Secondly, <hi>What ſhall we ſpeak?</hi> Thirdly, <hi>How ſhall we clear our ſelves?</hi> Truly, we know not what to ſay, nor ſpeak, nor how to clear our ſelves. The plain truth is, we have nothing at all to anſwer for our ſelves, but to yield our ſelves to thy mercy. Thus <hi>Job, I am vile, what ſhall I anſwer thee,</hi> the great God, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God, the mighty God, the wiſe God? what ſhall I anſwer thee?</p>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>When God is opponent, no man can be reſpondent.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>God can put ſuch queſtions, and make ſuch objections, as no man is able to anſwer. Thus ſpake <hi>Job</hi> at the 3d verſe of the ninth <hi>Chapter; If he</hi> (that is, God) <hi>will contend with him</hi> (that is, with man) <hi>he cannot anſwer him one of a thouſand:</hi> Which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth, that not only not one among very many men, but that not one among all men, or that not any man is able to anſwer, if God will contend. The Apoſtle ſaith of all men in a ſtate of ſin (<hi>Rom.</hi> 3.19.) <hi>We know, that what things ſoever the law ſaith, it ſaith to them who are under the law; that every mouth may be ſtopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.</hi> If the Lord ſhould make objections againſt, or charge ſinners, according to the ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſeverity of the law; the beſt, the holieſt of men could not find an anſwer, or no anſwer would be found in their mouths: how much leſs could any anſwer him, who not only were altogether <hi>born in ſin,</hi> as all are, and as the proud Phariſees told the poor man in the Goſpel he was (<hi>Joh.</hi> 9.34.) but abide and continue in ſin? How will the mouthes of all ſuch be ſtopt with a ſenſe of their ſelf-guiltineſs? how mute, how anſwerleſs will they ſtand before God? or ſay, as <hi>Job</hi> in the Text (but in a ten thouſand times ſadder plight than he) <hi>What ſhall we anſwer?</hi> It is the happineſs of humbled ſinners that they have Chriſt to anſwer for them, ſeeing in that caſe no ſinner can anſwer for himſelf. And
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:48669:272"/> ſuch is the Majeſty and glory of God, when it breaks forth in any caſe to a poor creature, that it leaves him quite anſwerleſs, and takes away not only all matter of diſpute, but of ſpeech; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Job</hi> reſolves upon ſilence, as appears by what he ſaith in the laſt clauſe of this verſe.</p>
                  <q>I will lay my hand upon my mouth.</q>
                  <p>As if he had ſaid. <hi>That all may ſee I know not what to anſwer, I will ſtop up the conveyance of anſwers.</hi> What this Scripture phraſe, <hi>to lay the hand upon the mouth,</hi> imports, hath been opened (<hi>Chap.</hi> 21.5.) In brief, <hi>Jobs</hi> meaning in reſolving thus, was, as if he had ſaid, <hi>I will impoſe ſilence upon my ſelf.</hi> Or thus, <hi>Lord, thou ſhalt not need to ſilence me or to ſtop my mouth, I will do it my ſelf; I know not what to anſwer thee; but if I did, if I could ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther up ſomething that might look like an anſwer, yet I will not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, I will lay my hand upon my mouth.</hi>

                  <p>Further when he ſaith, <hi>I will lay my hand upon my mouth,</hi> it may imply, that he would fain have been anſwering, though he could not tell what to anſwer.

They who are truly wiſe, are much aſham'd to ſpeak, when once they ſee their error in ſpeaking, or how apt they are to erre in ſpeaking; and therefore lay that penalty upon their tongues, either to ſpare ſpeaking, or to ſpeak very ſparingly. 'Tis ſeldom that the tongue is left looſe but it ſpeaks looſly, and it often ſpeaks thoſe things which give occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of offence both to God and man. As <hi>all iniquity ſhall</hi> (at laſt) <hi>ſtop her mouth (Pſal.</hi> 107.42.) that is, evil men (the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract is put for the concrete) ſhall be ſo aſhamed and confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for their evil deeds, that when they are charged with them or convinced of them, they ſhall hold their peace, as if their mouths were ſtopped, or like the man that came to the feaſt in the Goſpel without his Wedding-garment, they ſhall be ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs (Now, I ſay, as all iniquity ſhall ſtop her mouth for ſhame) ſo it is good for the beſt ſomtimes to ſtop their own mouths, for fear they ſhould ſpeak any iniquity. This godly fear, as well as a gracious ſhame, for what he had ſpoken amiſs before, cauſed <hi>Job</hi> to ſay,<note place="margin">Agnoſcit ſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parem eſſe ſuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nendae diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioni cum Deo, illo ſummo &amp; aeterno bono.

                  <p>That is, once have I ſpoken amiſs: not that he never ſpoke but once, for he had ſpoken often; but once he had ſpoken amiſs, and been too forward with his tongue.</p>
                  <q>But I will not anſwer.</q>
                  <p>That is, I will not ſpeak ſo again. But had <hi>Job</hi> ſpoken amiſs
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:48669:273"/> but once? he confeſſeth more in the latter part of the verſe.</p>
                  <q>Yea, twice, but I will proceed no furthor.</q>
                  <p>Once, yea twice. Some Interpreters are much in ſhewing what that <hi>once or twice</hi> ſpeaking ſhould be.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Some ſay it was that he ſo importunately deſired to plead with God. Secondly, Others, that he did ſo much ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie himſelf; for though he did well in maintaining his integrity, yet his over-doing it or being ſo much in it, was not well. Others, That his <hi>once</hi> was his complaining of the afflictions of the godly, eſpecially of his own, as if they were too heavy, and he not weighed in an even ballance, at leaſt afflicted more than needed. That his <hi>twice,</hi> was his heightning the proſperity of the wicked, as if God favoured them; at leaſt, that he did not puniſh them as they deſerved, nor ſhew diſpleaſure enough againſt them. But we need not ſtay upon ſuch particulars, nor take <hi>once and twice</hi> ſtrictly. This expreſſion, <hi>once, yea twice,</hi> implies only, that he had ſpoken often; I have ſpoken not only once, but twice, that is, I have ſpoken ſeveral times amiſs. The firſt ſtep beyond once is twice; and who knows how much beyond twice he had ſpake? when he ſaid <hi>once have I ſpoken, yea twice,</hi> the meaning plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is, I have ſeveral times ſpoken amiſs. We had this form of ſpeech (<hi>Job</hi> 33.14.) where <hi>Elihu</hi> told <hi>Job</hi> that the Lord <hi>ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth once, yea twice, yet man perceiveth it not;</hi> that is, he ſpeaks often, <hi>in a dream, in a viſion of the night,</hi> and man underſtands not the meaning of it. So here, I (ſaith <hi>Job</hi>) have ſpoken once, yea twice, or many times.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But I will proceed no further,</hi> or <hi>I will not adde</hi> ſaith the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew. I will no more apologize for my ſelf, nor ſtand in my own defence (for in ſo doing, I ſhall ſtand in my own light) but lay my ſelf low in the preſence of God. As if he had ſaid, <hi>My ſin is already too great, in that I have divers times ſpoken too bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and freely, if not preſumptuouſly about thy proceedings, but I will refrain from offending in that kind any more.</hi> The ſum of all that <hi>Job</hi> had ſpoken may be thus conceived. <hi>Now Lord I confeſs to thee, and before all the world, my ſin and folly in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning any of thy dealings with me, inſtead of ſubmitting to them, eſpecially in urging a hearing of my cauſe in thy preſence: Therefore I revoke my challenge, and caſt my ſelf at thy footſtool,

                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, In that <hi>Job</hi> confeſſeth <hi>once have I ſpoken, yea twice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note;
<q>A good man may fall often.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Once and more than once, once and twice, yea, more than twice. We cannot limit the number, nor ſay to this or that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the failings or ſinnings of a good man may come and no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Though it be very ſad to multiply ſins, yet the beſt of men have multiplied them.</p>
                  <p>From the latter words, <hi>I will proceed no further.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note, Secondly;
<q>Though a good man may fall often, yet a good man will not take leave to ſin often, no nor once.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He will not give himſelf a liberty to proceed or continue in ſin. When he hath ſinned once or twice, he does not ſay, poſſibly I may ſin again, therefore what ſhould I trouble my ſelf about it? who knows how often any man may ſin? no, though he knoweth not how often he may ſin, yet he will not, give himſelf liberty to ſin, not only, not knowingly, but not at all, once more; but ſaith, in the ſtrength of Chriſt, <hi>I will proceed no further,</hi> I will do ſo no more. A gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious heart is ſo far from taking liberty to ſin often, that he takes up a reſolve not to ſin, and will to the utmoſt watch againſt and keep himſelf pure from ſin, eſpecially from his ſpecial ſin; as <hi>David</hi> did, who ſaid (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.21.) <hi>I have kept my ſelf from mine iniquity.</hi> As if he had ſaid, <hi>There is an iniquity, which dogs me, and follows me, a ſin, which eaſily beſets me; but I have kept my ſelf, to the utmoſt of my power, from falling into that iniquity.</hi> And, I ſay, though a good man may multiply iniquity, yet wo to thoſe
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:48669:274"/> who give themſelves ſcope to multiply iniquity, or to commit any one iniquity. The voice of true repentance is this, <hi>I will ſin no more.</hi> Though I deny not, but a man, who hath truly repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of ſome particular ſin, and ſincerely purpoſed not to commit it any more, may (being over-powered by corruption and tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) be overtaken with the ſame ſin again; yet the voice of true repentance is this, and thus the penitent ſoul ſpeaks in truth, <hi>I will ſin no more, I will proceed no further.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, <hi>Job</hi> had been confeſſing his fault, his failings, <hi>Once have I ſpoken, yea, twice.</hi> The words are a penitent confeſſion, or the confeſſion of a penitent. Now ſaith he, <hi>I will proceed no further.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note, Thirdly;
<q>When ſins and failings are heartily and penitently confeſſed, they are not perſiſted nor perſevered in.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He that hath really confeſt his ſin, will (to his utmoſt) put a ſtop to his ſin; he will be ſo far from renewing or continuing in it, that he ſets himſelf might and main (and prayes in aid from God) againſt it. True confeſſion of ſin is always ſeconded and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with forſaking of ſin. The Prophet calling the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to repentance, ſaid (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.16.) <hi>Ceaſe to do evil.</hi> It will not avail us to ſay, we have done evil, unleſs <hi>we ceaſe to do evil.</hi> The promiſe of mercy is not to bare confeſſors, but to thoſe who are alſo forſakers of ſin (<hi>Prov.</hi> 28.13.) <hi>He that confeſſeth and forſaketh his ſin, ſhall find mercy (Prov.</hi> 30.32.) <hi>If thou haſt done fooliſhly, lifting up thy ſelf, or if thou haſt thought evil, lay thy hand upon thy mouth, do no more;</hi> that is, do not open thy mouth to ſpeak a word in defence of it, do not put forth thy hand any more to act it. Every unfeigned confeſſion of any one ſin,<note place="margin">Confeſſio pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cati eſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſio deſinendi peccare. <hi>Hilar.</hi> in Pſal. <hi>136.</hi> Irriſor eſt non poenitens, qui adhuc agit quod poenitet. <hi>Bernard.</hi>
                     </note> is a real profeſſion againſt that, and againſt all other ſins. That man (let him be who he will) <hi>is not a confeſſor of ſin to God,</hi> but a mocker of God, who confeſſeth a ſin, and takes no care to keep himſelf pure, not only from that, but from every ſin. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>John</hi> doth not only ſay, <hi>Whoſoever is born of God, doth not commit ſin,</hi> but, <hi>he cannot ſin, becauſe he is born of God</hi> (1 Epiſt. 3.9.) Not that he hath not a natural power to ſin; but he hath not a will, a mind to ſin, or he ſins not with the full conſent or ſwing of his will, or he hath a ſincere bent of will againſt every ſin, and
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:48669:275"/> would ſin no more. How wicked and bent to back-ſliding were thoſe <hi>Jews,</hi> to whom the Lord ſaid by his Prophet (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.5.) <hi>Why ſhould ye be ſtricken any more? ye will revolt more and more.</hi> The will of a wicked man is wholly for ſin: the will of a godly man (as ſuch) is wholly againſt ſin; ſo that when he ſinneth, he may be ſaid to ſin againſt his own will, as well as againſt the will of God; and therefore, being convinced that he hath ſinned, though but in paſſion or by impatient words (as <hi>Jobs</hi> caſe was) he gives his honeſt word for it (as <hi>Job</hi> here did) that he <hi>will proceed no further.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In theſe three verſes, <hi>Job</hi> hath ſhewed his repentance for his unwary ſpeeches and exceſſes in language; he hath confeſſed his own vileneſs, and ſits down as ſilenced by God, yea, as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing ſilence upon himſelf. Thus he is got a good way in the work of humiliation; yet he was not come quite through, he had not yet made ſuch a confeſſion of his ſin, nor was his heart ſo hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled as it ought to be, before God would raiſe him up; and therefore in the following part of this Chapter, and in the next, God ſets upon him again, and ſpeaks to him a ſecond time out of the whirlwind. The Lord had begun to humble him, and <hi>Job</hi> had begun to humble himſelf, yet the Lord deals further with him to humble him more, and ſpeaks to him again out of the whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind: What again out of the whirlwind? Yes; <hi>Then anſwered the Lord unto</hi> Job <hi>out of the whirlwind, and ſaid,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And not only ſo, but after the Lord had put many queſtions to him, about himſelf, as before about ſeveral creatures, he had a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve of two creatures more to queſtion with him about, that would more aſtoniſh him than all the reſt, <hi>Behemoth</hi> and <hi>Levia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus we ſee, when once the Lord begins to humble a ſoul, he will make through work of it, and never give it over, till he hath brought him to the duſt indeed. <hi>Job</hi> was ſo far humbled, that he had no more to ſay unto God; but God had much more to ſay unto <hi>Job,</hi> and all for this end, that he might humble him more, as will appear in opening that which followeth.</p>

                  <p>IN the former verſe <hi>Job</hi> gave out in the plain field, confeſſing himſelf overcome, not by rigour and force of arms, but by reaſon and ſtrength of argument, or rather by that which is above all reaſons and arguments, the ſoveraign power and authority of God; and thereupon he reſolved to meddle no more, to anſwer no further; and that, though he had ſpoken once, yea twice, yet he would not proceed, he would adde no more, he had enough of it, he had already ſpoken too much, much more (with reſpect to God) than came to his ſhare. Hereupon the Lord, at this 6th verſe, begins again to ſpeak and anſwer him; and his anſwer is contained and continued quite through this fortieth Chapter, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the whole one and fortieth, and in it we may conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe four things diſtinctly.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, We have here a challenge, at the 7th <hi>verſe; Gird up thy loyns now like a man; I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, We have in this anſwer of God, a reproof of <hi>Job,</hi> or a vehement expoſtulation with <hi>Job,</hi> in the 8th and 9th <hi>verſes; Wilt thou alſo diſannul my judgement? wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayſt be righteous? Haſt thou an arm like God? canſt thou thunder with a voice like him?</hi> Thus he expoſtulates, thus he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, We have here a large proof or demonſtration of the greatneſs, power, wiſdom, and ſoveraignty of God, for the further conviction and humiliation of <hi>Job.</hi> And this proof or demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the power of God is laid down two wayes.</p>
                  <pb n="528" facs="tcp:48669:276"/>
                  <p>Firſt, By his providencial actings, in deſtroying proud and wicked men. This we have in the 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 <hi>verſes; Deck thy ſelf now with majeſty and excellency, and array thy ſelf with glory and beauty; caſt abroad the rage of thy wrath, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold every one that is proud, and abaſe him.</hi> As if the Lord had ſaid, theſe things I do; I look on every one that is proud, and bring him low, <hi>I tread down the wicked in their place,</hi> &amp;c. All this I can do, and do in my providences daily; <hi>Job,</hi> canſt thou do ſo too? Thus we have a proof of the great power and ſoveraignty of God taken from his judiciary proceedings with proud men.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, He gives of a proof his great power by a double in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, from the work of creation; as in the former Chapter by the works of <hi>providence</hi> alone, ſo here by the works of <hi>creation</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence too. And this double inſtance is given in two great vaſt living creatures; one of them the greateſt upon the earth, the other the greateſt in the waters.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is <hi>Behemoth,</hi> the vaſteſt creature that breaths upon the earth, who is deſcribed from the 15th <hi>verſ.</hi> of this Chapter, to the end.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is <hi>Leviathan,</hi> the vaſteſt creature in the water, who is deſcribed quite through the one and fortieth Chapter. The Lord having ſpoken of many other creatures formerly, in the forming and ordering of which, his power and wiſdom ſhine forth; he reſerved theſe two to cloſe with, that <hi>Job</hi> by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of them, might ſee what a poor thing himſelf was, and how unable to grapple with the great God, who made thoſe great creatures; for that is the general iſſue. If God hath made ſuch huge creatures as theſe, then what a one is God! how mighty and powerful is God! what is the cauſe, if the effects are ſuch? what is the <hi>fountain,</hi> if we ſee ſuch <hi>ſtreams?</hi> Such is the drift of God in this his laſt anſwer to <hi>Job,</hi> and theſe are the parts of it. We may ſum up all in this brief; here <hi>humane weakneſs</hi> and <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Power</hi> are compared together; <hi>mans nothingneſs,</hi> with <hi>Gods Allneſs</hi> or <hi>Alſufficiency,</hi> that ſo man (<hi>Job</hi> in ſpecial) might be convinced, and conclude that he could no more charge God with any fault, than he was able to reſiſt his power.</p>
                  <p>So then, this whole oration or diſcourſe tends to the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of <hi>Job,</hi> yet more, in believing the irreſiſtible providence of God; which, when he ſhould well underſtand, he would no
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:48669:276"/> more doubt of his juſtice, nor accuſe his judgements of ſeverity, nor would he any more deſire to debate with God as he had done.</p>
                  <p>Nor can theſe things be preſſed too often upon the holieſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men, man being not only by nature altogether unbelieving, but having ſo much unbelief mingled with his graces, as ſad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience teacheth him at all times, eſpecially in times of great affliction and temptation.

                  <p>What a <hi>whirlwind</hi> is, was there opened, and ſeveral points of obſervation given from it, which I ſhall not now at all touch up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor meddle with; and yet, though the words in this 6th verſe of the 40. Chapter, are the very ſame with thoſe in the firſt verſe of the 38th Chapter, yet from their placing and their repeating here, we may profitably take notice of ſome things for our inſtruction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Then the Lord anſwered</hi> Job <hi>out of the whirlwind, and ſaid.</hi> The <hi>whirlwind</hi> being here ſpoken of a ſecond time, 'tis queſtioned by ſome, whether this were a whirlwind of greater force, or of leſs than the former, or the ſame. The ground of the querie is from a little variation which is in the Hebrew Text. In the 38th Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an Article is prefixt to the word <hi>whirlwind,</hi> which (ſay ſome)
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:48669:277"/> intends the ſence, noting it to be a very <hi>vehement</hi> whirlwind: But in the 40 Chapter, that article is left out; upon which they collect, That this latter whirlwind was not ſo fierce, nor ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement as the former. But this is only a conjecture; nor can any thing be ſolidly grounded upon ſuch Grammatical differences; yea, ſome, notwithſtanding that defect of the Article, conceive the <hi>whirlwind</hi> here in this Chapter, was more vehement than that in the former Chapter. But I ſhall not ſtay about that Querie, nor diſcourſe any thing concerning the nature of the <hi>whirlwind,</hi> which was toucht before at the 38. Chapter, but ſhall</p>
                  <p>Obſerve, Firſt;
<q>God hath terrible wayes of revealing himſelf, as well as ſweet and gentle wayes.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>To ſpeak out of a <hi>whirlwind,</hi> is a dreadful manifeſtation. The whirlwind, and ſpeaking out of it, notes a <hi>legal</hi> diſpenſation, or a miniſtration of terror, ſuch as the Law was publiſhed in, of which we read in the 19th of <hi>Exodus,</hi> which was ſo terrible (ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.) that <hi>Moſes himſelf ſaid, I exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fear and quake.</hi> The Lord hath his <hi>Mount Sinai</hi> diſpenſations, in <hi>thunder</hi> and <hi>lightning,</hi> and with a <hi>terrible voice;</hi> and he hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo his <hi>Mount Sion</hi> diſpenſations in ſweet and precious promiſes, and Goſpel-Ordinances; he hath his beſeechings, his intreatings, his wooings, his invitings. Divine diſpenſations vary. 'Tis ſaid (1 <hi>King.</hi> 1.6.) in the Hiſtory of <hi>Eliah,</hi> that when the Lord ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, there was <hi>an Earth-quake, and the Lord was not in the Earth-quake; there was a mighty wind, and the Lord was not in the wind; there was fire, and the Lord was not in the fire:</hi> At laſt, <hi>there came a ſtill ſmall voice, and there the Lord was.</hi> The Lord waved the dreadful manifeſtation of himſelf, by winds, tempeſt, thunder, fire, Earth-quake, and came only in a ſtill voice. The reaſon why the Lord doth thus variouſly diſpenſe himſelf, ſometimes in a whirlwind, ſometimes in a gentle gale, is to anſwer the ſeveral tempers and ſpirits of men; where the ſpirits of men will not bow, the Lord knows how to break and bring them down; and where the ſpirits of men are already bowed and broken, humbled and melted, the Lord knows how to comfort and confirm them: <hi>He will not break the bruiſed reed, nor quench the ſmoaking flax.</hi> And when it is ſaid, <hi>He will not
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:48669:277"/> break,</hi> the meaning is, he will bind up and ſtrengthen <hi>the bruiſed reed;</hi> And when it is ſaid, he <hi>will not quench,</hi> the meaning is, he will blow up and kindle <hi>the ſmoaking flax,</hi> that is, weak belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, or ſouls afflicted under the ſenſe of their own weakneſs and ſinfulneſs, or ſinful weakneſſes.</p>
                  <p>'As tis a great part of the wiſdom of the Miniſters of the word, <hi>to divide the word aright,</hi> that is, to give every one a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſutable to his condition (they muſt ſpeak to ſome, as it were, in a whirlwind, in the whirlwind of the Law; they muſt ſpeak to others in a ſtill voice, that of the Goſpel; they muſt threaten and terrifie ſome, comfort and refreſh others) So the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf deals; he hath many wayes of humbling the creature, and as many wayes of comforting the creature; he ſpeaks in a whirlwind (as I may ſay) when he threatens in the Law, he ſpeaks dreadful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſometimes by his providences and judgements (there's a voice in them) he ſpeaks terribly to us in our own perſonal afflictions, and when under ſad diſpenſations: All this is, as it were, a ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the whirlwind. And he ſpeaks graciouſly, winningly and comfortably, or <hi>to the hearts of his people,</hi> even when he leads them into the wilderneſs (<hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.14.) The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the terror of the Lord we perſwade men;</hi> that is, we perſwade men by the terror of the Lord: and ſo, knowing the <hi>goodneſs</hi> and the <hi>mercy</hi> of the Lord, we perſwade men; that is, we perſwade them by the <hi>goodneſs</hi> &amp; the mercy of the Lord. <hi>I</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom,</hi> 12.1.) <hi>beſeech you by the mercies of God, preſent your bodies,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Of ſome we muſt have compaſſion, making a difference; &amp; others ſave with fear</hi> (Jude <hi>verſ.</hi> 22.23.) that is, we muſt put them in fear, that they may be ſaved, or (as I may ſay) ſcare and fright them to heaven.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Conſider, who it is that the Lord ſpake to in a whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind; he ſpake to <hi>Job:</hi> and who was <hi>Job?</hi> ſurely a very godly man, a man that feared God, a man that had a very noble teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny from God himſelf, and yet here God ſpake to <hi>Job</hi> himſelf in a whirlwind.</p>
                  <pb n="532" facs="tcp:48669:278"/>
                  <p>Hence, Note;
<q>The best of men may ſometimes need the terrible appearances of God, to humble them and to bring them to a due confeſſion of their ſins.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Certainly God would not have ſpoken to <hi>Job</hi> in a whirlwind, if there had not been cauſe for it; he would not have ſpoken twice in a whirlwind, if there had not been double cauſe for it. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith (1 <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.6.) <hi>Ye are in heavineſs through manifold tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations</hi> (that is, afflictions and trials) <hi>if need be.</hi> We ſhould never feel any affliction from the hand of God, never be in heavineſs, if there were not need. There is need that the holieſt in this world ſhould ſometimes be made heavy, or that heavineſs ſhould be upon them for a time. We ſhould always have calms and fair weather, never any ſtorms, nor tempeſts, nor whirlwinds from God, did not our needs call for it. As we every day need bread, which is therefore called by Chriſt <hi>our daily bread;</hi> ſo moſt days we need a rod, either the rod of his mouth to reprove us, or the rod of his hand to chaſten us: And we do ſo, eſpecially, for theſe reaſons.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To bring us into a deep ſence of our own vileneſs, to humble us, to lay us low.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, To make greater impreſſions upon our hearts, of the power and ſoveraignty of God, of the holineſs and righteouſneſs of God. It is, that we might know our ſelves more, and that we might know God more, that God ſpeaks to us in whirlwinds, in terrible diſpenſations.</p>
                  <p>Further, As this is a <hi>ſecond whirlwind,</hi> as it is a ſecond ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Job,</hi> a good man, in a whirlwind,</p>
                  <p>Obſerve;
<q>God will not give over terrible diſpenſations and appearances, till he hath brought man to his purpoſe.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>God hath an end, a purpoſe in every work, and every work of his goeth on, till he hath attained his purpoſe. As the word which goeth out of the Lords mouth ſhall not return unto him void, but ſhall accompliſh that which he pleaſeth, and proſper in the thing whereto he ſends it (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.11.) So the work which God takes in hand, ſhall not be in vain, but ſhall proſper to the purpoſe for which he undertakes it. Now if any ask what is the purpoſe of
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:48669:278"/> God in whirlwind diſpenſations? that was ſhewed before, even to make us more humble, and to have higher thoughts of God in every reſpect.</p>
                  <p>But ſome may ſay, <hi>Job</hi> had very low thoughts of himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he had ſaid, <hi>I am vile;</hi> doubtleſs <hi>Job</hi> ſpake this in great humility: why then doth the Lord ſpeak to <hi>Job</hi> in a whirlwind again, ſeeing he was truly humbled at his firſt ſpeaking?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, Though <hi>Job</hi> was humbled, yet he was not hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled enough, he was not yet laid low enough, nor melted down enough, and therefore God ſpake to him in a whirlwind again. It would not ſerve his turn, barely to ſay <hi>I am vile,</hi> God muſt have more of him than that, he muſt make a fuller confeſſion of his fault than that; God brought him at laſt to ſay, <hi>I abhor my ſelf, and repent in duſt and aſhes,</hi> which is a deſcription of deepeſt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation. Now becauſe <hi>Job</hi> was not come to that, but had only ſaid, <hi>I am vile</hi> (though there was matter of great humiliation in that) the Lord queſtions with him again in a whirlwind. This ſhould be of great conſideration to us in any day of affliction.</p>
                  <p>For if God hath not his purpoſe in bringing the firſt affliction, we ſhall be ſpoken to in a whirlwind a ſecond time. We are apt to wonder and think it ſtrange, that God ſhould ſpeak terribly to us ſo often, that he ſhould renew our afflictions, and make us new croſſes. We think, if we do but make a light confeſſion of our ſins, and ſay, <hi>we are vile,</hi> preſently the ſtorm ſhould ceaſe, and the affliction be removed. Let us not deceive our ſelves, <hi>Job</hi> had ſaid he was vile; yet God continued the ſtorm, becauſe he was not yet low enough. 'Tis not enough for us that we are <hi>truly hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled.</hi> As there muſt be <hi>truth</hi> in our humiliation, ſo there muſt be <hi>depth</hi> in it; for queſtionleſs, when <hi>Job</hi> ſaid before, <hi>I am vile,</hi> he did not diſſemble with God, he was hearty in it, and ſpake his heart; what he ſpake was from his very ſoul, and in ſincerity, he did not complement with God, he did not <hi>flatter God with his mouth, nor lie unto him with his tongue,</hi> as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.36.) <hi>his heart was right with God,</hi> as theirs was not (<hi>ver.</hi> 37.) yet, becauſe his ſpirit was not come down as it ſhould, therefore he muſt be awakened and humbled more with another whirlwind, he muſt be further ſchool'd, that he might give further glory to God in his own abaſement.</p>
                  <pb n="534" facs="tcp:48669:279"/>
                  <p>And hence we may infer;
<q>If the Lord ſpake thus to <hi>Job,</hi> and may ſpeak thus terribly to any good man, once and again? Then with what terror, in how dreadful a whirlwind, will God at laſt ſpeak to all the wicked of the world?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>If he ſpake out of a whirlwind to a <hi>Job</hi> a gracious godly man, what will that whirlwind be, out of which he will ſpeak to a <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roah,</hi> to prophane and hard-hearted ſinners! As our Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſaid of himſelf in the Goſpel, <hi>If it be thus done to a green tree, what ſhall be done to the dry?</hi> If God hath whirlwinds for his <hi>Jobs,</hi> for his own people, who are as green flouriſhing trees in grace and holineſs; what will he do with the dry ſticks of the world? And I may argue it as the Apoſtle doth (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.13.) <hi>If judgment begin at the houſe of God, what ſhall the end be of them that obey not the Goſpel?</hi> what ſhall <hi>their</hi> end be? no man is able to ſay, no nor to conceive how ſad it will be. Judgment begins at the <hi>houſe of God;</hi> God will not ſpare his own houſe, not his own houſhold, he will not ſpare his Servants and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren when they ſin; he is no cockering Father, he will cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect his own Children; he will not only ſweep his houſe, but he will <hi>ſhake</hi> his houſe; and he ſhakes it, becauſe it is no better ſwept, nor kept more cleanly. And if for theſe, and ſuch like reaſons we at any time ſee judgment beginning at the houſe of God, we may ſay with aſtoniſhment, <hi>What will the end of thoſe be who obey not the Goſpel!</hi> What will become of the wicked and ungodly, of thoſe who openly prophane and blaſpheme his Holy Name! O what appearances ſhall they have of God, and how ſhall they appear before God! We read, in the 25th of <hi>Jeremy;</hi> of a Bowl of blood given him to carry about to the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:</hi> A terrible meſſage he is ſent about; he carries a Cup of blood about, and bids the Nations drink, they muſt drink it; and ſaith the Lord, <hi>If they ſhall refuſe to take the Cup at thy hand to drink, then ſhalt thou ſay unto them, thus ſaith the Lord of hoſts, ye ſhall certainly drink:</hi> Why? <hi>For lo, I begin to bring evil upon the City which is called by</hi> My Name; <hi>and ſhall ye be utterly unpuniſhed?</hi> As if the Lord had ſaid, I have brought evil upon <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> upon my own people, and they have drunk very deep of that bitter Cup; and do you, O ye uncircumciſed nations, think that you ſhall eſcape? We may conclude, the Lord hath a
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:48669:279"/> terrible ſtorm to bring upon the wicked and ungodly of the world, when we hear him ſpeaking to his own people in <hi>whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winds. Conſider this ye that forget God</hi> (as ſuch are admoniſhed <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.22.) <hi>leſt he tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver. For our God ſhall come, and ſhall not keep ſilence; a fire ſhall devour before him, and it ſhall be very tempeſtuous round about him,</hi> as 'tis ſaid at the 3d verſe of that <hi>Pſalme.</hi> And <hi>Then,</hi> as 'tis threatned (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 2 5.) <hi>ſhall he ſpeak to them in his wrath, and vex them in his ſore diſpleaſure.</hi> That ſpeaking will indeed be ſpeaking out of a whirlwind, which ſhall hurry them away into everlaſting darkneſs.</p>
                  <p>Thus far of the manner of Gods ſpeaking to <hi>Job</hi> the ſecond time; It was ſtill out of the whirlwind. Now followeth the matter ſpoken, or what he ſpake to him.</p>
                  <q>
                     <bibl>
                        <hi>Verſ. 7.</hi>
                     </bibl> Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.</q>
                  <p>I ſhall add but little about this verſe, becauſe we have had it almoſt word for word (<hi>Chap.</hi> 38.3.) where the Lord thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpake <hi>Job, Gird up now thy loins like a man, for I will demand of thee, and anſwer thou me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe words this ſecond time ſpoken or repeated by God to <hi>Job,</hi> fall under various apprehenſions, theſe four eſpecially.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Some look upon them meerly as a challenge ſent of God; <hi>Gird up now thy ſelf like a man,</hi> come ſtand to thy work, or rather ſtand to thy word, do thy beſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Others expound them as an irony or divine ſcorn, put upon <hi>Job</hi> to humble him. Come, <hi>Gird up thy loin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> like a man;</hi> Don't flinch for it, ſtand to it, thou wilt ſurely make good the day with me.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Many (in a milder ſenſe) look upon theſe words, meerly as <hi>Counſel</hi> given to <hi>Job;</hi> as if the Lord had ſaid, <hi>I mean to deal further with thee, Therefore come now, prepare and addreſs thy ſelf to the buſineſs; I give thee leave to make the beſt thou canſt of thy cauſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, We may take theſe words,<note place="margin">Eſto bono ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> as ſpoken to <hi>Job</hi> for his <hi>Comfort</hi> and encouragement. The Lord ſeeing him as it were ſinking, and refuſing to ſpeak, ſaith to him, be not troubled, be of good chear man, <hi>Gird up thy loins like a man.</hi> As the words are taken for a <hi>challenge,</hi> and under the notion of a <hi>ſcorn</hi> put upon <hi>Job,</hi> I ſhall not ſtay upon them.</p>
                  <pb n="536" facs="tcp:48669:280"/>
                  <p>This phraſe <hi>(Gird up thy loins)</hi> was opened at the 38th <hi>Chap.</hi> 'tis a metaphor taken from Travellers, or thoſe that go about any buſineſs; who wearing long garments, uſed to gird them up, that they might be more expeditious, whether for labour or for travel.</p>
                  <p>Thus the words are matter of <hi>Counſel</hi> and encouragement given to <hi>Job,</hi> and under that notion I ſhall Note two things from them.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, As they are words of counſel, the Lord having further buſineſs with <hi>Job</hi> or more to do with him, adviſeth him to gird up his loins like a man.</p>
                  <p>Hence, Obſerve;
<q>When we have to do with God, we ſhould put out our ſelve to the uttermoſt.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>To <hi>Gird up our loins like a man</hi> imports our beſt preparation; and ſuch preparation we need for every holy duty. When we are to pray, we had need gird up our loins like men, for then we are to wreſtle or ſtrive with God, we muſt work it out with God in the duty of prayer; and if our garments hang looſe, that is, our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections be upon the earth, and our hearts in the corners of the world, how can we prevail with God in prayer? we muſt gird up our loins like men, when we declare our deſires and requeſts to God in prayer, and expect that God ſhould anſwer us. The holy Prophet complained of the Jews failing in this (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.7.) <hi>There is none that calleth upon thy name, that ſtirreth up himſelf to take hold of thee.</hi> Doubtleſs many called upon God in thoſe days, but they did not ſtir up themſelves to take hold of God by faith, and ſo their prayers went for no prayers. And when we go to <hi>hear the word</hi> (wherein God deals with us) we had need gird up the loins of our minds, elſe we cannot mind the word while we hear it, nor remember, much leſs practice the word which we have heard. The Scripture often calls us to <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration</hi> for every duty: What can diſcompoſed perſons, looſe-ſpirited perſons, looſe-loin'd perſons do <hi>with</hi> God or <hi>for</hi> God? When we have any thing to do <hi>with</hi> God, any thing to do <hi>for</hi> God, we ſhould do our beſt, and be at our beſt, we ſhould play the men. Maſter <hi>Broughton</hi> expreſſeth it well, though not clear to the words in the Original, <hi>Let me ſee thy skill</hi> or how skilfully thou canſt handle the matter with me. The Lord would have us ſhew
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:48669:280"/> our skill when we have any thing to do with him, or to do for him; we ſhould then <hi>play the men and not the children,</hi> much leſs ſhould we play the <hi>fools,</hi> be ſloathful, ſluggiſh, and careleſs.</p>
                  <p>Eſpecially we ſhould do this with reſpect to the appearing of Jeſus Chriſt in the great day of our account: Chriſt himſelf gives the rule, <hi>Stand with your loyns girt, and your lamps burning, as thoſe ſervants that wait for their Lords coming.</hi> When Chriſt our Lord comes, all muſt come before him, but none ſhall be able to ſtand before him, but they who ſtand with loyns girt; that is, who are ready, and in that readineſs wait for his coming.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Taking theſe words as words of encouragement: <hi>Gird up thy loyns like a man;</hi> Poor heart, do not faint.</p>
                  <p>Note;
<q>When God intends and purpoſeth to humble his people moſt, he would not have them deſpair in the leaſt.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>When God layes them in the duſt, he would not have them ſink in deſpair, but be of good cheer. God loves to ſee his people humbled, but he doth not love to ſee them dejected. As God would have us ſenſible, ſo comfortable. <hi>Comfort ye, comfort ye my people,</hi> ſaid the Lord (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.1.) when he ſaw they were ready to ſink, he commanded comfort to be ſpoken to them. He gives Cordials and Reſtoratives, when he is ſpeaking out of a <hi>whirlwind;</hi> and therefore he ſaid to <hi>Job, Gird up thy loyns like a man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But however the Lord is either counſelling or comforting <hi>Job</hi> in theſe words, he checks and reproves him in the next.</p>
                  <q>
                     <bibl>
                        <hi>Verſe 8.</hi>
                     </bibl> Wilt thou alſo diſanul my Judgement? wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayeſt be righteous?</q>
                  <p>Theſe are words of reproof, and a very great reproof they are. Here the Lord begins to chide and expoſtulate with <hi>Job.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>Wilt thou.</q>
                  <p>'Tis a quick kind of ſpeech;<note place="margin">Irritum facere eſt ſimplex verbum con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarium verbo confirmandi, aut natum fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mumque ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid faciendi.</note> ſuch Queſtions have much ſpirit and life in them. How now <hi>Job, Wilt thou diſanul my Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But what is meant by <hi>diſanulling,</hi> what by the <hi>Judgement,</hi> that God ſaith <hi>Job</hi> was about to <hi>diſanul?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="538" facs="tcp:48669:281"/>
                  <p>To <hi>diſanul,</hi> is to make void, to fruſtrate, to break a thing, ſo as it ſhall not ſtand in any ſtead, or be of any force; it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the breaking of an Oath, to the breaking of a Covenant, and to the diſappointment of counſels and purpoſes.

But did <hi>Ezra</hi> think, that after that they ſhould no more break the Commandements? Taking a breach of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements barely for <hi>ſinning,</hi> he could not expreſſe it ſo; therefore by <hi>breaking the Commandements,</hi> he means <hi>diſanulling</hi> the Commandements: What is that? 'Tis ſo to break the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, as if we would reſcind and repeal them. There is ſuch a kind of ſinning, as if men would not onely ſin againſt the Law, but ſin the Law away, or out of doors, as if men would ſin the Bible out of the world: that's the meaning of the word there, <hi>If we ſhall again break thy Commandements;</hi> for it followeth, <hi>and joyn in affinity with the people of theſe abominations.</hi> 'Tis not break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Commandements by any ſin, but to ſin ſo as if we would make them all void, and reverſe the ſtatutes of heaven. Thus the word is uſed by <hi>David (Pſal,</hi> 119.126.<note place="margin">An etiam mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabis judicium meum? <hi>Targ.</hi>
                     </note>) which doth much clear the ſenſe of this Text, <hi>Lord, it is time for thee to work;</hi> Why? <hi>for they have made void thy law.</hi> 'Tis the ſame word here in <hi>Job,</hi> They have <hi>diſanulled</hi> thy law. 'Tis high time for God to awake, to beſtir himſelf, and look to men, when they come to this height of ſinning, to make void and diſanul his Law, by ſetting up their own luſts. Some would even enact their own luſts, and throw down the Law of God. That's the ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficancy of the word here uſed; ſaith God to <hi>Job, Wilt thou diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anul my Judgement?</hi> Wilt thou make it void, or break the courſe of it? Wilt thou change it, and put or introduce ſomewhat of thine own in the room and place of it, as ſome gloſſe the words? <hi>Wilt thou diſanul</hi>
                     <q>
                        <pb n="539" facs="tcp:48669:281"/>My judgement?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Judgement,</hi> I conceive, in this place is taken for that courſe of adminiſtration which God uſes in the World, whether with particular perſons, or with Nations. As if the Lord had ſaid, <hi>Thinkeſt thou thy ſelf not only able to comprehend the reaſon of all my adminiſtrations towards thy ſelf or others, but wilt thou alſo preſume to ſubject them to thy will and wiſdom; as if thou couldst adminiſter them with more equality and righteouſneſs, or to better purpoſe than I have done?</hi> The courſe or way of Gods diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is Gods Judgement; and 'tis called his <hi>Judgement,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe it proceeds upon the higheſt reaſon, upon the cleareſt acting of Judgement and underſtanding; and in that ſenſe 'tis alwayes Judgement. For <hi>God is a God of Judgement</hi> (Iſa. 30.18.) That is, of the higheſt reaſon and underſtanding in all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that he doth.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, 'Tis called <hi>Judgement,</hi> becauſe oftentimes theſe adminiſtrations are as a ſentence pronounced and given out by God, whether againſt particular perſons or Kingdomes, and ſo have Judgement in them, that is, wrath and <hi>puniſhment. Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> is often put for puniſhment. In this ſenſe we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it here. <hi>Wilt thou diſanul my Judgement,</hi> particularly with thy ſelf. I have taken this courſe with thee, I have brought all theſe afflictions upon thee, I have broken thy eſtate, I have broken thy body, I have broken thy ſpirit; this is the courſe I have taken with thee: wilt thou diſanul this courſe that I have taken with thee? ſurely thou ſhouldeſt not, I know thou canſt not. So then, the Lord expoſtulates thus with <hi>Job,</hi> as if he would have croſſed all his proceedings and dealings with him, or would have reſcinded as it were the ſentence and decree of God concerning him. Wouldeſt thou have me to change either the matter, manner, or meaſure of thy chaſtnings? No, my will, not thine, ſhall be the rule of them. <hi>Wilt thou diſanul my Judgement?</hi> Now from this ſenſe of the words,</p>
                  <p>Note, Firſt;
<q>It is impoſſible to reverſe, reſcind, or diſanul the Judgement of God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Lord ſpeaks to <hi>Job</hi> as attempting a thing beyond himſelf,
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:48669:282"/> or beyond his power. What, ſaith the Lord, wilt thou diſanul my judgement? ſurely thou wilt not venture at that, thou wilt not offer that; 'tis more than thou or any man can do. The Lords judgement, or the way which he will take with any man, no man can ſuperſede or ſtop; no man can hinder him in it. What the Lord determines, what he gives forth, it ſhall ſtand. <hi>Balaam</hi> could ſay (<hi>Numb.</hi> 23.20.) <hi>The Lord hath bleſſed, and I cannot reverſe it.</hi> The judgement of the Lord at that time towards <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> was a Judgement or Sentence of favour and mercy; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith <hi>Balaam, The Lord hath bleſſed, and I cannot reverſe it.</hi> And if the Lord gives out a Sentence of affliction, or commands a croſſe upon any man, who ſhall reverſe it (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.10.) <hi>The Counſel of the Lord ſhall ſtand, and the thoughts of his heart to all generations.</hi> They ſhall ſtand; who then ſhall make them fall? The Sentences or Judgements of men are often diſanulled by men, and they may alwayes be diſanulled by God (<hi>Lam.</hi> 3.38.) <hi>Who is he that ſaith, and it cometh to paſs, when the Lord hath not commanded.</hi> The Lord can diſanul all the Judgements of men, of the wiſeſt men in the world; but none can diſanul the Lords Judgements, and make them void. There are but two wayes by which the Judgement, that is, the Sentence, or the reſolution and purpoſe of a man is diſanulled.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, By the power of the party againſt whom the Judgement is given. Sometimes there is a Sentence given againſt a man, which comes to naught, 'tis made void; why? there's no power can execute it upon him: <hi>David</hi> ſpake much in that language, <hi>Ye ſons of</hi> Serviah <hi>are too hard for me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Sometimes the Judgements of men are diſanulled by a ſuperiour Authority; one Court recalls or takes off the Judgement of another. But neither of theſe wayes can the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God be diſanulled. If God give out a Sentence againſt a perſon, his power, how powerful ſoever he is, ſhall never hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the execution of it; though he be (as it's ſpoken in <hi>Amos</hi>) as high as the Cedar, and as ſtrong as the Oak, yet he ſhall not hinder the Judgement of God. And as there is no man hath power of arm; or of arms, to hinder the Judgement of God; ſo there is no Authority ſuperiour to, or above Gods. There's no Court above the Court of Heaven, to which appeal may be made, to get Gods Sentence diſanulled, or his Judgement
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:48669:282"/> reverſed; therefore the Judgement of God cannot be diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulled.</p>
                  <p>And ſeeing the Judgements of God, as taken for the Sentence which he hath declared againſt ſinners, ſuch as that (<hi>Rom.</hi> 2.9.) <hi>Tribulation and anguiſh upon every ſoul that doth evil,</hi> &amp;c. cannot be diſanulled; what cauſe have we to bleſſe God for Chriſt, who hath endured that Judgement in his own perſon, which could not be diſanulled nor made void; and hath alſo (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.14.) <hi>blotted out the hand-writing of ordinances that was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his Croſſe.</hi> Yet</p>
                  <p>Obſerve, Secondly;
<q>The Judgements of God are by him accounted as diſanulled or made void by us, when we do not ſubmit to them, nor humble our ſelves as we ought under them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This was <hi>Jobs</hi> Caſe. Why doth God aske him whether he would diſanul his Judgement? ſurely, becauſe he had made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny complaints (as hath been ſhewed in this Book) about the dealings of God with him: The Lord interpreted this as a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anulling of his Judgement. If we are not ſatisfied with the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, though it be a Judgement of anger and diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure towards us, we, as much as in us lies, diſanul the Judgement of God. Let us often remember this, The way of Gods proceeding with us, his way of adminiſtration towards us, is his Judgement; now if it be a way of affliction, if he ſpeak terribly to us, let us take heed of complaining, leſt we be found diſanulling his Judgement. We may come under the compaſſe of this Charge before we are aware. As for inſtance;</p>
                  <p>If we ſhall ſay, we could bear any Judgement but this, any affliction but this; this is to diſanul the Judgement of God. Let us ſay, whatever the affliction is, it is beſt for us, and God hath moſt righteouſly brought it upon us.</p>
                  <p>Again, If we ſhall ſay, we could be patient even under this Judgement of God for the <hi>matter</hi> of it; but when we conſider the degree of it, that it goes ſo far, and wounds ſo deep, who can bear it? Thus <hi>Job</hi> complained (<hi>Chap.</hi> 6.2.) <hi>Oh that my grief were throughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the ballan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces together; for now it would be heavier than the ſand of the Sea:
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:48669:283"/> therefore my words are ſwallowed up.</hi> It was not ſo much the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his affliction, as the degree, or weight, or extremity of it, which put him to thoſe grievous complaints. Now if we are not patient and quiet under that very <hi>degree</hi> of the Judgement which God is pleaſed to heighten it unto, this is a diſanulling of his Judgement; therefore let us take heed of complainings upon that account.</p>
                  <p>Yet further, Others will ſay, If this Croſſe had been for a ſhort time, we could have born it; but it hath been long upon us already, and we know not how long it may continue, we can ſee no end of it. Take heed of theſe complainings; for this alſo is to diſanul the Judgement of God, if we find fault with the length of the Croſſe. Though we may cry with the ſouls under the Altar, <hi>How long Lord, how long,</hi> yet we muſt not ſay it is too long.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, There is this alſo at which many are much troubled, and ſo even diſanul the Judgement of God; for ſay they, if it were but in ſome one thing that we were afflicted, we could bear it; but we are afflicted in body, and afflicted in mind, and afflicted in our children, and afflicted in our eſtate, we are afflicted in our credit, and in all our comforts; if it had been in ſome one thing, we could have ſat down quietly under it; but now it's af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction all over. Take heed, for this alſo is to diſanul the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God. And if any of theſe be to diſanul the Judgement of God, how ſoon may we do it? And if they are not, as to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, free from this charge, who ſhew ſome impatience and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of ſpirit under the ſeverer dealings of God, what ſhall we ſay of thoſe who openly murmur, and even rage againſt them?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Wilt thou diſanul my Judgement?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note;
<q>God takes it as a high affront, and a diſhonour, when his Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is touched, or when his Judgement is not quietly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Wilt thou,</hi> ſaith he, What! <hi>diſanul my Judgement!</hi> The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Let God be true, and every man a liar.</hi> Let the Judgement of God ſtand, though we fall.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Conſider what a huge boldneſſe it is in a creature, to do or ſay any thing which may be interpreted a diſanulling of the Judgement of God.</p>
                  <pb n="543" facs="tcp:48669:283"/>
                  <p>Fifthly, Conſider how ſinful a thing it is for any to go about to croſſe the adminiſtration of God. Somewhat we may do, in all the judgements or ſad diſpenſations of God; we may pray about them, and we may in an humble ſubmiſſion expoſtulate with God about them; but we muſt take heed of an unquiet ſpirit under them, or of any riſings of heart againſt them: Pray we may about them, earneſtly, inſtantly, and importunately, and the more the better, yet ſtill quietly ſubmit; and the more qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly we ſubmit to them, the more fit we are to pray to, and wreſtle with him about them; that he in his own good time, and in his own way, would remove them from us. <hi>Wilt thou diſanul my Judgement?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>Wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayeſt be righteous.</q>
                  <p>Theſe words may be taken as an Expoſition of the former. As if the Lord had ſaid, <hi>Either I muſt be condemned, that thou mayest be righteous, or thou muſt be condemned, that I may be righteous; now whether it be meet that I or thou muſt be condemned, do thou judge. While thou inſiſteſt ſo much upon thine own innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, thou ſeemeſt to caſt blame upon my Juſtice. Either I have wronged thee by afflicting thee without just cauſe, or thou haſt wronged me by intimations that I have done ſo: One of theſe muſt needs be true, ſeeing there is no middle between them. Conſider then which is moſt probable, that I have wronged thee, or thou me. Theſe are immediate contraries; ſo that the one being granted, the other muſt be denied. Now wilt thou accuſe me of injuſtice in afflicting thee, that thy cauſe may be eſteemed just?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But did <hi>Job</hi> ever accuſe or condemn the Lord?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, Not directly (as hath been ſhewed heretofore) It never came into <hi>Jobs</hi> heart to accuſe God of unrighteouſneſs: but becauſe by ſome miſunderſtood ſpeeches of his, they about him judged he had; therefore the Lord put this queſtion home to him, that he might exonerate and clear himſelf. The onely mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in which he might ſeem to condemn God as unrighteous, was his ſpeaking ſo much of his afflicting the righteous, and proſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the unrighteous; or his inſiſting ſo much upon the defence of his own righteouſneſſe before men, ſeemed to derogate from, or intrench upon the righteouſneſſe of God. So then <hi>Job</hi> did not intentionally caſt any aſperſion or blot upon the Juſtice of God;
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:48669:284"/> he onely intended, in what he ſaid, to ſhew that the affliction that was upon him, was not for his ſin, but for his trial, when he ſpake ſo much of his own righteouſneſſe; and yet becauſe he was a little too laviſh in ſpeech, and too paſſionate, the Lord here puts this queſtion to him, <hi>Wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayeſt be righteous?</hi> 'Tis I that juſtifie thee, and wilt thou condemn me? The Lord is righteous, and all men are unrighteous; and ſhall any man do that which caſts a note of unrighteouſneſſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God. <hi>Wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayeſt be righteous?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence Note, Firſt;
<q>He that is much in the juſtifying of himſelf, when he is under the Judgement, or afflicting hand of God, doth upon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter condemn God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Job</hi> was much in juſtifying himſelf, though not with an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to condemn God, yet the very action ſpake this in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of others, that he thought himſelf not righteouſly dealt with, or at leaſt rigorouſly dealt with. He that maintains his own right too much in affliction, chargeth God with wrong, though he never meant it: And therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Let God be true,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Deum injuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae accuſare videbatur qui juſtos afflige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rei. <hi>Merc.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>and every man a liar.</hi> A godly man in a good frame, though he cannot charge himſelf with any crime, nor is conſcious of any way of wickedneſs, that he hath lived in, yet approves and juſtifies the Lord in all his dealings with him; and therefore we muſt take heed (it is a tender point) how we juſtifie our ſelves, eſpecially under the afflicting hand of God. If we juſtifie our ſelves, there is ſomewhat of condemnation caſt upon God; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſtill you ſhall find that the holieſt ſervants of God in their Confeſſions charge all upon themſelves. <hi>Righteouſneſs belongs to God, but to us ſhame and confuſion of face.</hi> So ſpake <hi>Ezra,</hi> and ſo ſpake <hi>Daniel.</hi> It is very dangerous to, and we quickly may, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon the juſtice of God, and derogate ſomewhat from him, by our juſtifying of our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve, Secondly;
<q>'Tis our duty in all things whatſoever God doth, to juſtifie him.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">In dubio ſemper adverſum nos pro deo ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endum eſt. <hi>Merc.</hi>
                     </note>As it is the higheſt grace which God manifeſts to the creature, to juſtifie man. <hi>It's God that juſtifies; who ſhall condemn.</hi> So it is one of the moſt excellent duties of man, to juſtifie God.
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:48669:284"/> It is a high grace of God to man, to juſtifie man; but it is onely the duty of man to juſtifie God in all things. Let him do what he will with perſons or Nations, let him break them all to pieces, let him lay all waſte and deſolate; in all this we are to juſtifie God. We ſhould rather be willing to appear ſinful, and that we are puniſhed for our ſins and evil deeds, than ſo much as in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance to queſtion or make the leaſt doubt of the juſtice of God, or give others the leaſt ſhadow of an occaſion to queſtion or doubt it.</p>
                  <p>That of the Schoolman bears much weight in this caſe.<note place="margin">Aquinas.</note> 
                     <hi>If</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>two are equal, and a fault is to be laid upon one of them; it is not reprovable, if one of them purge himſelf of the fault char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, although he be blameable in the opinion of others; becauſe man naturally loveth himſelf more than another. But where there is ſo great a diſtance, as between God and man, man ſhould rather take the blame to himſelf, though unjuſtly laid on him, than caſt it upon God; which he cannot do but unjuſtly. And therefore God in arguing with</hi> Job, <hi>propoſeth the ſuperlative excellency of himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Obſerve, Thirdly;
<q>We ſhould be much in judging our ſelves.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayeſt be righteous?</hi> Thou ſhouldeſt condemn thy ſelf, and judge thy ſelf; thy judgement is upon a wrong object. Self judgement is good, but judging of God, oh how ſinful is that (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.31.) <hi>If we would judge our ſelves, we ſhould not be judged of the Lord.</hi> Our buſineſſe is to judge our ſelves, and for not judging of our ſelves, it is, that we meet with ſo many judgements from the hand of God. Therefore God judgeth us, becauſe we do not judge our ſelves. And therefore let every mouth be ſtopt; it ſhall be ſo at laſt as the Apoſtle concludes (<hi>Rom.</hi> 3.18.) <hi>Every mouth ſhall be ſtopt, and all the world ſhall become guilty before God.</hi> We are ſelf-guilty, and therefore ſhould be ſelf-condemned. 'Tis a dreadful thing in one ſenſe to be ſelf-condemned, as it is ſpoken of the Heretick (<hi>Tit.</hi> 3.11.) <hi>He is condemned of himſelf:</hi> He is condemned of himſelf, while he doth juſtifie himſelf. 'Tis the worſt of condemnations, to be condemned of our ſelves, by juſtifying of our ſelves; but it is good to condemn our ſelves, in judging or in humbling our ſelves.
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:48669:285"/> 
                     <hi>David</hi> was much in ſelf-cenſuring and ſelf-judging: when he found himſelf envying the proſperity of the wicked, and ſaid, he had <hi>clenſed his heart in vain,</hi> he ſoon after cenſures himſelf for both (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.22.) <hi>So fooliſh was I and ignorant, even as a beaſt before thee.</hi> As if God had ſaid, what a fooliſh creature am I, thus to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn God in his proceedings, &amp; to talk of my own innocency. Let us not boaſt of, but (as Maſter <hi>Calvin</hi> expreſſeth it upon the Text) <hi>let us win our ſpurs by condemning our ſelves:</hi> For that is the only way to honour and exalt God. If we would get honour to our ſelves, it muſt not be by conteſting with God, but by humbling our ſelves before him; there's no obtaining with God, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending with him, much leſs by condemning him.</p>

                  <p>THe Lord at the 6th <hi>verſe</hi> of this <hi>Chapter,</hi> entered upon a vehement expoſtulation with <hi>Job,</hi> to humble him and bring down his ſpirit; and that <hi>Job</hi> might be thorowly humbled, here the Lord in this 9th verſe ſheweth what a diſparity there was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween himſelf and <hi>Job,</hi> as before in his righteouſneſs, <hi>Wilt thou condemn me that thou mayſt be righteous?</hi> art thou more righteous than I? So here in his power.</p>
                  <q>
                     <bibl>
                        <hi>Verſ. 9.</hi>
                     </bibl> Haſt thou an arm like God? canſt thou thunder with a voice like him?</q>
                  <p>As if the Lord had ſaid, <hi>Let me ſee what thou canſt do, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou canſt do like God, ſeeing thou carrieſt thy ſelf ſo unlike a man?</hi> That's the ſcope and tendency of this 9th verſe, as of thoſe that went immediately before.</p>
                  <p>The whole verſe conſiſts of two convincing queſtions. The firſt, in thoſe words, <hi>Haſt thou an arm like God?</hi> The ſecond, in theſe, <hi>Canſt thou thunder with a voice like him?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>Haſt thou an arm like God?</q>
                  <p>The arm, properly taken, is a noble and an eminent limb or member of mans body. Nor hath any creature, nor is any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:48669:285"/> ſo much as ſaid to have an arm but man. And ſome may ſay, ſeeing the arm is a bodily member, how can God, who hath no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, be ſaid to have an arm? I anſwer; 'tis true, God is a ſpirit, without diſtinction of parts; yet frequently in Scripture, as hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane paſſions, ſo bodily parts are aſcribed to God improperly or by a figure. And becauſe the arm is a ſtrong and noble member of mans body, that member by which man puts forth the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his ſtrength, that member by which he doth and atchieves great things; therefore the arm in Scripture ſignifies power, and is the embleme of might and ſtrength. In this language the Lord threatned old <hi>Eli</hi> the High Prieſt (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.31.) <hi>Behold the days come that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy fathers houſe,</hi> &amp;c. that is, I will take away thy power, and the power of thy family. Thus (<hi>Zech.</hi> 11.17.) <hi>Wo to the idol ſhepherd, that leaveth the flock, the ſword ſhall be upon his arm;</hi> that is, his power ſhall be broken, and he made uſeleſs, as that man is whoſe arm is wounded. And as the arm notes miniſterial power, ſo magiſtratical power, whether abuſed or rightly uſed (<hi>Job</hi> 35.9.) <hi>They cry out by reaſon of the arm of the mighty;</hi> and (<hi>Chap.</hi> 38.15.) <hi>The high arm ſhall be broken.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now as the arm is put for the power of man, ſo for the power of God (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 98.1.) <hi>O ſing unto the Lord a new ſong, for he hath done marvellous things; his right hand and his holy arm hath gotten him the victory.</hi> Read alſo (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.16. and <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.12.) and here in the Text, <hi>Haſt thou an arm like God?</hi> Is thy arm like Gods arm? that is, is thy power like Gods power?</p>
                  <p>Hence, Note;
<q>Firſt, <hi>God hath a mighty power?</hi> He hath an arm.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are three Scripture expreſſions, which in a gradation hold forth the power of God.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The finger of God (<hi>Exod.</hi> 18.9.) When the Magici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans could not imitate <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Plague of Lice, then they ſaid unto <hi>Pharaoh, This is the finger of God;</hi> that is, the power of God is eminent in this miracle, it exceeds our power, we not only cannot do the like, but nothing like it, as we did before in ſemblance of thoſe former miracles. Thus Chriſt himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing blaſphemed by ſome of the Jews, who ſaid, <hi>He caſteth out devils through</hi> Beelzebub <hi>the chief of devils,</hi> anſwered (<hi>Lu.</hi> 11.20.) <hi>If I by
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:48669:286"/> the finger of God caſt out devils,</hi> &amp;c. that is, If I by the power of God, or by <hi>the holy Spirit</hi> (ſo another Goſpel hath it (<hi>Mat.</hi> 12.28.) <hi>If I by the Spirit of God) caſt out divels,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The power of God is expreſſed by the <hi>hand,</hi> which containeth all the fingers (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.1.) <hi>Behold, the Lords hand is not ſhortened that it cannot ſave,</hi> that is, his power is not abated; he hath a long hand ſtill, his power to ſave is as great as ever it was. The ſame Prophet ſaith (<hi>Chap.</hi> 9.17.) <hi>The hand of the Lord is ſtretched out ſtill,</hi> that is, his power is ſtill at work to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh impenitent ſinners. How much and how long ſoever God hath puniſhed ſinners, he can puniſh them longer and more; if they continue longer in ſin, or ſin more and more.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, We have here in this Text, and in many others, the <hi>arm of God</hi> (that's more than his hand) ſignifying the fullneſs of his power. Not that there are any real gradations in the power of God; but there are gradations in the exerting and putting forth of his power. Sometimes God putteth forth his power (as it were) by a finger only, as <hi>Rehoboam</hi> ſaid (1 <hi>Kings</hi> 12.10.) <hi>My little finger ſhall be thicker than my Fathers loins;</hi> that is, the leaſt that I will do in my government ſhall be more afflictive and burdenſom to you (if you call it a burden) than the moſt that my Father <hi>Solomon</hi> did in his. At another time God putteth forth his power by his hand, you may ſee his whole hand, that is, fuller and clearer evidences of his power, in what he doth or hath done, that is, in his works of providence, whether in breaking down or building up. And laſtly, he ſheweth <hi>his arm,</hi> his ſtretched-out arm, that is, the fullneſs of his power. God hath power, great power, mighty power, he hath an arm, an out-ſtretched arm; and this arm of God is ſpoken of in Scripture for a four-fold uſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, For the ſafe guarding of his people; 'tis a protecting arm. The arm of God with us ſignifieth our ſafety. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, ſpeaking of the dealings of God with his ancient people, ſaith (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.12.) <hi>He led them by the right hand of</hi> Moſes <hi>with his glorious arm;</hi> that is, his protecting arm, by which he ſaved that people from the wrath of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in their firſt advance out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and from the wrath of all their enemies, in all their encampings and marches to <hi>Canaan,</hi> was very glorious. This glorious arm of his, is a defence upon all his glory (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 4.5.)
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:48669:286"/> that is, upon his whole Church, for there his truth, holineſs, and holy worſhip, which are his glory, are held up, and held out. The Church of God, is ſo much for the glory of God, that 'tis called his glory.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As the Lord hath a protecting arm from evil, ſo an arm delivering and pulling out of evil. The deliverance which God wrought for the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in bringing them out of <hi>Egypt (Exod.</hi> 6.16. <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.15. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.19.) is ſaid to be done by <hi>an out-ſtretched arm,</hi> that is, by his power viſibly put forth, and even to the utmoſt, in the wonderful effects of it. All the while God did not deliver <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of their bondage, he might be ſaid to draw in or hide his arm; but when he delivered them, then he was ſaid to ſtretch it out.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, As the arm of God is for the protection and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of his people, ſo for the deſtroying of his and their enemies. God hath a deſtroying arm, and of that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpake (<hi>Deut.</hi> 33.27.) <hi>The eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting arms; and he ſhall thruſt out the enemy from before thee</hi> (that's ſometimes the work of the everlaſting arms of God) <hi>and ſhall ſay, deſtroy them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The Lord hath an aſſiſting, helping, ſtrengthning arm to carry us thorough any good work or duty, which he calleth us unto (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.1.) <hi>Who hath believed our report, and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?</hi> that is, who hath received power to believe, and do according to what the Lord hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed? The arm of God works powerfully, not only upon the outward man, but upon the heart of man, for the converting and ſaving of ſouls (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.3.) <hi>In the day of thy power thy people ſhall be willing.</hi> The power of God put forth upon the inner man, for full conviction and ſound converſion is greater than any power, that worketh upon, for, or againſt the body of man. <hi>God hath a mighty arm</hi> for all theſe purpoſes, and for many more, even for as many as he is pleaſed to make uſe of it, or employ it in.</p>
                  <p>And if any ask, <hi>How mighty is his arm?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, No man knoweth how mighty it is; only this we know, <hi>It is Almighty.</hi> What the might of Almightineſs is, who can underſtand! <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpake admiringly more than knowingly to this point (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.11.) <hi>Who knoweth the power of thine an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger?</hi>
                     <pb n="550" facs="tcp:48669:287"/> The anger of God is beyond comprehenſion, and ſo is his love; <hi>Who knoweth the power of his love?</hi> We are exhorted (<hi>Eph.</hi> 3.19.) <hi>To know the love of God, which paſſeth knowledge.</hi> What the <hi>heighth, depth, length and bredth of divine love are &amp; anger,</hi> no man knoweth; nor doth any man know the dimenſions of divine power. The Apoſtle ſpeaking of God as a Spirit, ſaith (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.16.) <hi>Whom no man hath ſeen, nor can ſee.</hi> So we may ſay of God as powerful; no man knoweth, nor can know how powerful he is. He muſt be as powerful as God, who knoweth how power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful God is.</p>
                  <p>Only this we may ſay, Firſt, his power is ſo great, that he can do all things, and he can do all things with eaſe, <hi>There is nothing hard to God.</hi> Hard things are eaſie to God. Some things are hard, and others eaſie to men; but to God all things are alike. Not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is nothing too hard for the Lord, as he ſaid to <hi>Abraham (Gen.</hi> 18.14.) but the truth is, nothing is hard to him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, His power is ſo great, that he can do whatſoever he willeth or hath a mind to do (<hi>Job</hi> 23.13.) <hi>He is in one mind, and who can turn him? and what his ſoul deſireth, even that he doth.</hi> And as the Lord can and will do whatever he hath a will to do, ſo to clear the point a little further, we may boldly ſay, he hath a will to do all things of theſe three ſorts:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, He hath a will to do whatſoever he hath promiſed, purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, or determined to do. Now, if we duly weigh what great things there are in the promiſes and purpoſes, in the counſels and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of God to do in the world, we may ſoon conclude with truth and ſobriety, that great things will be done in their proper times and ſeaſons.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Lord doth aſſure us, he hath a will to do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever we ask of him in faith, and according to his will. If we have a rule for our asking, or if we ask by rule, we have a Gods word for it, that it ſhall be done and given to us according to our ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings (1 <hi>John</hi> 5.14.) <hi>And this is the confidence that we have in him, that if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us.</hi> What is that? is it only that he perceives or knows what we ask? no, his hearing is the granting and giving what we ask. God is engaged by his gracious promiſe, that his arm ſhall do all that we pray for right for the matter, and aright for the manner, in faith and in ſincerity.</p>
                  <pb n="551" facs="tcp:48669:287"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, It is the will of God to do whatſoever is for the real good of his people, though (poſſibly) they ask it not. It is the will of God, not only to do what we ask, but many times, more than we ask. As <hi>God is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think (Eph.</hi> 3.20.) ſo he actually doth for us much more than we ask or think. The Lord expects we ſhould pray for every good thing which he hath promiſed; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had no ſooner made many large and moſt gracious promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of doing great things for the Church, with this aſſurance (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.36.) <hi>I the Lord have ſpoken it, and I will do it.</hi> But preſently he adds (<hi>verſ.</hi> 37.) <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord God, I will yet for this be enquired of by the houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>to do it for them.</hi> We ſhould extend our prayers and our ſeekings to the utmoſt line of the word, or our prayers ſhould be commenſurate both to propheſies and promiſes: Prayer helps them all to the birth, and they ſeldom bring forth alone. And indeed prayer is nothing elſe, in the matter of it, but a turning or putting the promiſes into pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions, tis a ſuing out the good of the promiſe: Yet there are ſome good things in the promiſes which we cannot reach, or at leaſt are not mindful of. There is a great latitude in the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, <hi>The Commandements of God are exceeding broad (Pſal.</hi> 119.96.) Who can find out all the duty of them! And doubtleſs the promiſes are exceeding broad; who can find out all the mercy in them! The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> (2 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 1.4.) calls them <hi>exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great and precious promiſes;</hi> they are exceeding good, and they are exceeding great, they are as great as they are good; and who hath a heart great and good enough to ſee and ſue out all the good and great things in them? Now I ſay, though (poſſibly) we ask not for all the good of the promiſe (at leaſt not expreſly) yet it is the will of God to do all that for us, and to beſtow all that good upon us which he hath promiſed. He hath preventing grace; his firſt grace he alwayes giveth unasked. When he begins to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt himſelf to a poor ſoul to bring him out of a ſtate of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is ſuch a ſoul begging this of God? no; he is running from, and rebelling againſt God. <hi>I am found of them that ſought me not,</hi> ſaith the Lord (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.1.) Now, as they who are not the Lords, receive grace to become his, unasked; ſo they that are the Lords, through grace, receive many mercies unasked. God will not fall in giving all that he hath promiſed, though we fail in
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:48669:288"/> asking ſome things promiſed: His arm is powerful enough to do what he willeth; and this is the will of God, to fulfil or make good all his promiſes. Men often out-promiſe themſelves, but God doth not. <hi>Haſt thou an arm like God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence take theſe inferences;
<q>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> If the Lord hath ſuch a mighty arm, Then let us take heed we do not provoke the Lord to turn his arm againſt us.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>That's the uſe which the Apoſtle makes of this point, and which naturally floweth from it (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.22.) <hi>Do ye provoke the Lord to anger? are ye ſtronger than he?</hi> The Apoſtles ſenſe hits the language of the Text fully; as if he had ſaid, <hi>Have you an arm like God?</hi> There's no compariſon between yours and his; <hi>He can cruſh you before the moth (Job</hi> 4.19.) that is, as ſoon as, or before a moth is cruſhed, which crumbleth to duſt with the leaſt or lighteſt touch of the hand, or little finger.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> If the Lord have ſuch an arm, Then let us la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to get and engage the arm of the Lord for our help.</q>
                  <p>Men love to be on the ſtronger ſide; and ſome reſolve to be on the ſtronger ſide, though it ſhould be, or not regarding whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no it be the worſer ſide. Now ſeeing all have a natural deſire to intereſt themſelves where the greateſt ſtrength is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there probably and rationally the greateſt ſafety and beſt ſhelter is; then, how ſhould we labour to get and aſſure an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in God, which cannot be done, but by being on Gods ſide (that is, by keeping cloſe to him in all the duties of holineſs and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs) for doubtleſs he is ſtrongeſt; his ſide is not only a good, but the beſt, not only a ſtrong, but the ſtrongeſt ſide. Hath any man an arm like God? can all men, ſhould they joyn all their arms in one, make an arm like Gods? They cannot. Nor is there any arm ſtrong, but in or by the ſtrength of Gods arm. As old dying <hi>Jacob</hi> ſpake while he was bleſſing his ſon <hi>Joſeph (Gen.</hi> 49.24.) <hi>The archers have ſorely grieved him, and ſhot at him, and hated him; but his bow abode in ſtrength, and the arms of his hands were made ſtrong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob.</hi> How were his arms made ſtrong! How did his bow abide in ſtrength! It was by the hands (that is, by the power) of the mighty God
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:48669:288"/> of <hi>Jacob.</hi> Nothing made him ſtrong, nor to abide in ſtrength, but the arm of the mighty God. In this arm of God, the Church triumphed of old (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 124.1, 2, 3.) <hi>If it had not been the Lord, who was on our ſide, now may</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſay, If it had not been the Lord, who was on our ſide, when men roſe up againſt us, then they had ſwallowed us up quick, when their wrath was kindled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us:</hi> Their wrath was kindled into a burning flame, yet we were not burnt, much leſs utterly conſumed, becauſe the ſtrong God was with us, or becauſe, as the Pſalm concludeth, <hi>Our help is in the name of the Lord, who made heaven and earth.</hi> What help can we need at any time, which he cannot give us, who made heaven and earth without any help or helper? It is an impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Tower of comfort, that at what loſs ſoever we are, we may find help, or help is to be had in God.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If God hath ſuch a mighty arm, Then let us truſt him.</q>
                  <p>We may truſt to his ſtrength; and when his ſtrength is indeed truſted to, our truſt is withdrawn from all other ſtrengths. We may uſe the arm or ſtrength of creatures, while we truſt in the arm or ſtrength of God; but while we truſt in the ſtrength of God, we muſt truſt in no ſtrength but his, nor, if we really truſt him, can we. When <hi>Senacherib</hi> King of <hi>Aſſyriah</hi> invaded <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> with a mighty Hoſt, <hi>Hezekiah</hi> thus incouraged his people (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32.7, 8.) <hi>Be ſtrong and couragious, be not afraid nor diſmayed for the King of</hi> Aſſyria, <hi>nor for all the multitude that is with him, for there be moe with us than with him; with him is an arm of fleſh, but with us is the Lord our God to help us, and to fight our battels; and the people reſted themſelves upon the words of</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah <hi>King of Judah.</hi> They had an arm; what arm? not an arm of fleſh (like <hi>Senacheribs</hi>) but the arm of the Lord for their help, and that carried the day. Created power is too ſlight to be truſted; but the power of the Creator calls all for our truſt. We cannot truſt creatures too little (as to ſucceſs) nor can we truſt God too much. Hath any man an arm like God?</p>
                  <p>A fourth Inference may be this;
<q>If the Lord hath ſuch an arm, ſuch power, This ſhould encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage us to the duty of prayer.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>We are eaſily perſwaded to ſeek to him for help, who hath
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:48669:289"/> ſtrength to help, eſpecially when we know that he hath an incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nableneſs of will to help us. Hath not the Lord a ſtrong arm? hath he not an inclinable will? Let us then in all our needs pray as the Church did (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 51.9.) <hi>Awake, awake, put on ſtrength, O arm of the Lord</hi> (the Lord and his arm are the ſame) <hi>awake as in the ancient dayes, in the generations of old; art thou not it that hath cut</hi> Rahab, <hi>and wounded the dragon?</hi> The Lord hath a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty arm, yet his arm or power ſeemeth to be ſometimes (as it were) aſleep; that is, not to act, or not to take notice how it is, or how matters go with the Church. Now, when at any time it is thus, our duty is to awaken the Lord by earneſt prayer; <hi>Awake, put on ſtrength, O arm of the Lord.</hi> It is a mercy when we have an heart to pray, and a God to pray unto, who can quickly <hi>put on ſtrength;</hi> that is, give undeniable evidences that he hath a ſtrong arm, yea, infinitely the ſtrongeſt arm; which may be</p>
                  <p>A ſecond obſervation, taken or ariſing from theſe words, as ſpoken comparatively, <hi>Haſt thou an arm like God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>The arm or power of the creature, is nothing to the arm or power of God; no creature hath an arm like Gods.</q>
                  <p>There is nothing in the world conſidered in a gradual diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, ſo unlike another, as the arm of God, and the arm of man are. Mans arm is ſo ſmall a thing compared with Gods, that it is a very nothing, not ſo much as a candle to the Sun, nor as a drop to the Ocean, nor as one ſingle duſt to the globe or body of the whole earth. No Rhetorick can ſpeak diminutively enough of mans arm, compared with Gods, nor can any divinity utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by men or Angels: yet how apt is man to have too high thoughts of mans arm, and too low of Gods. Were it not that men are apt to have too high thoughts of mans arm, and too low of Gods, this queſtion had never been put to <hi>Job, Haſt thou an arm like God? Job</hi> had been a man of as big an arm, as moſt in his dayes. 'Tis ſaid of him, that he was <hi>the greateſt of all the men of the Eaſt</hi> (Chap. 1.3.) And he ſaid of himſelf (Chap. 29 25.) <hi>That he ſate chief, and dwelt as King in the Army.</hi> Now ſhould we look upon <hi>Jobs</hi> arm, not as (when God ſpake this to him) lean and thin, and extreamly fallen away, if not quite withered, but as I was at beſt, fulleſt, thickeſt, ſtrongeſt, before he fell into that affliction, or after his reſtauration out of it;
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:48669:289"/> yet what was <hi>Jobs</hi> arm or power, in his higheſt advancement, to the arm and power of God! might not God then have ſaid to him, as well as when he ſaid it, <hi>Haſt thou an arm like God?</hi> or hath any man at this day? <hi>Surely</hi> (ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 62.10.) <hi>men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lye, to be laid in the ballance</hi> (that is, if they are truly weighed, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if they are weighed with God) <hi>they are altogether lighter than vanity.</hi> For, Firſt, the power of man to help, is weak and vain (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.16.) <hi>There is no King ſaved by the multitude of an H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſt; a mighty man is not delivered by much ſtrength.</hi> And that's an unqueſtionable truth, whether we underſtand it of his own ſtrength, or of the ſtrength of any others, who come in and contribute their utmoſt to his aid and aſſiſtance. And this is one reaſon, why the Lord calls us off from truſting to the arm of man (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 146.3.) <hi>Put not your truſt in Princes, nor in the ſon of man, in whom there is no help.</hi> True, may ſome ſay, it were a a folly to truſt in weak Princes, to truſt in them for help, who have no power to help; but we will apply to mighty Princes, we hope there is help in them; No: thoſe words, <hi>In whom there is no help,</hi> are not a diſtinction of weak Princes from ſtrong, but a concluſion, that there is no help in the ſtrongeſt. That's ſtrange; what? no help in ſtrong Princes! If he had ſaid, no help in mean men, carnal reaſon would have conſented; but when he ſaith, <hi>Truſt not in Princes, nor in any ſon of man,</hi> one or other, who can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this? yet, this is a divine truth, we may write <hi>inſufficiency, inſufficiency,</hi> and a third time <hi>inſufficiency,</hi> upon them all; the cloſe of that verſe in the Pſalm, may be their Motto, <hi>There is no help in them.</hi> And if any ſhall truſt in man for help, ſome one of, if not all, theſe evils or ſad iſſues will follow.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, He will be deceived and diſappointed; what he looked upon as a rock, will prove but a ſand; what he took for a Cedar, will prove but a reed, and the more he leans upon it, the more it fails him, as the Scripture ſpeaks.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, He will be aſhamed and vexed (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 20.5.) <hi>They ſhall be afraid &amp; aſhamed of</hi> Ethiopia, <hi>their expectation, &amp; of</hi> Egypt, <hi>their glory;</hi> that is, which they gloried in, and believed would b ing them in much glory, or into a very glorious condition. They probably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected help from <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> but they gloried in the fore-thoughts of that help which they preſumed <hi>Egypt</hi> would give them, but
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:48669:290"/> they gloried in that which ſoon proved their ſhame.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If any truſt in any arm of fleſh, it will bring a curſe upon him (<hi>Jer.</hi> 17.5.) <hi>Curſed be the man that maketh fleſh his arm, and whoſe heart departeth from the Lord.</hi> Nor doth the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet only pronounce a curſe upon that man, but explains the curſe, or tells him plainly what it ſhall be, both in the negative, and in the affirmative; <hi>He ſhall be like the heath in the deſert, and ſhall not ſee when good cometh, but ſhall inhabit the parched places of the wilderneſs, in a ſalt land, and not inhabited.</hi> Then, <hi>ceaſe from man whoſe breath is in his noſtrils, for wherein is he to be accounted of?</hi> Whatſoever account is to be made of man, this is not, that he ſhould be truſted in. We may apply to men for help, but we muſt not truſt in them, as if they could carry the matter for us; <hi>Have men an arm like God?</hi> Mans is but a weak and withered arm; and as the arm of man is not to be truſted in for any help he can give us, ſo</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The arm of man is not to be feared for any hurt he can do us. Theſe two have a near relation to, and dependance upon each other; for they who are ſo ſtrong, that we are ready to truſt them, if we can make them our friends, thoſe we are as ready to fear, if they turn our enemies; and they who never truſt in man unduly, will not fear man but according to duty. And we have no reaſon, if we conſider that, and what, the arm of man is in the hand of God, to fear the arm of man. The Scripture ſpeaks often of the Lords dealing with the ſtrongeſt arm of man (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 30.21.) <hi>Son of man, I have broken the arm of</hi> Pharoah, <hi>King of</hi> Egypt, <hi>and loe, it ſhall not be bound up to be healed, to put a roller to bind it, to make it ſtrong to hold the ſword. Pharoah</hi> had an hurting arm, an arm ſtretched out againſt the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God; but God did more than hurt, he broke that arm. And conſider how the Spirit of God followeth the metaphor, <hi>It ſhall not be bound up. Pharoah</hi> would fain have got his broken arm ſet, hoping it might be ſtronger than ever: No, ſaith God, <hi>It ſhall not be bound up to be healed, to put a roller to bind it, to make it ſtrong.</hi> As if the Lord had ſaid, <hi>Pharoah</hi> may call for his <hi>Chyrurgions</hi> to bind up his broken arm, yet it ſhall be without effect; all their skill and <hi>Chyrurgery</hi> ſhall be in vain, his arm ſhall not be healed nor made ſtrong. Again (<hi>Jer.</hi> 48.25.) <hi>The horn of</hi> Moab <hi>is cut off, and his arm is broken.</hi> A ſavage beaſt cannot hurt us when his
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:48669:290"/> horn is cut off, nor can a cruel-hearted man, with a broken arm. In theſe and many other Scriptures we ſee, both that mans arm is in the hand of God, and what God doth often to mans arm; upon which conſiderations he infers (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 51.12.) <hi>I am he that comforteth thee; Who art thou that art afraid of a man that ſhall die, and of the ſon of man that ſhall be made as the graſs, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteſt the Lord thy maker?</hi> As if the Lord had ſaid, doſt thou hear and believe that I have a ſtronger arm than man? and art thou, who haſt an intereſt in me, afraid of a man? We have cauſe to fear man, when we do that which is evil; the magiſtrates arm <hi>beareth not the ſword in vain, for he is the Miniſter of God, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venger to execute wrath upon him that doth evil (Rom.</hi> 13.4.) But to all them who remain peaceably in their duty to God and man, Jeſus Chriſt hath ſaid, (<hi>Luke</hi> 12.4, 5.) <hi>Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that, have no more that they can do: But I will forewarn you whom you ſhall fear; fear him, which after he hath killed, hath power to caſt into hell; yea, I ſay unto you, fear him.</hi> Chriſt, who gave but a ſingle prohibition of our fear of man, gave a double charge to fear God, knowing that to be the beſt cure of, and remedy againſt any undue or ſinful fear of man.</p>
                  <p>Further, ſeeing God hath ſuch an arm, let us be much in the conſideration of it, let us often meditate upon the ſtrength of his arm, his almighty power. The mighty God is as a weak one to us, both for the doing us good, and the keeping us from evil, till we ſit down, and believingly meditate upon his almighty power and greatneſs. As <hi>David</hi> called the faithful of old to view the ſtrength of <hi>Sion (Pſal.</hi> 48.12.) <hi>Walk about</hi> Sion, <hi>and go round her; mark well her Bullwarks, tell her Towers.</hi> So I may call upon all to view the ſtrength of the God of <hi>Sion,</hi> and to remember his arm, which is the only ſtrength, the Bullwark, the Tower of <hi>Sion. Be ſtill</hi> (ſaith the Lord, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 46.10.) <hi>and know that I am God.</hi> We never truly know either that God is, or what God is, we know him not to be God, but carry it as if he were but a man, till we <hi>are ſtill,</hi> that is, compoſed into a deep ſilent conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his eternal power and Godhead, or that he is God. And the godly have done ſo, eſpecially in two caſes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, When they ſaw little humane ſtrength, little of mans arm for them.</p>
                  <pb n="558" facs="tcp:48669:291"/>
                  <p>Secondly, When at any time they ſaw the arm of man great and ſtrong againſt them. In both which caſes we find <hi>David</hi> often in the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> and other good Kings wholly taken up in the thought of, and in acting their faith upon the arm or power of God. Thus did King <hi>Aſa</hi> (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 14.11.) and thus did King <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.6, 12.) <hi>O Lord God of our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, art not thou God in heaven? and in thy hand is there not power and might? ſo that none is able to withſtand thee? O our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no might againſt this great company, that cometh againſt us; neither know we what to do, but our eyes are upon thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So much of the firſt humbling queſtion in this verſe, <hi>Haſt thou an arm like God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A ſecond followeth, <hi>or</hi>
                     <q>Canſt thou thunder with a voice like him?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>To thunder may taken either properly, for the ſending out of that loud and terrible ſound or crack, which we ſometimes hear from the clouds, and ſo we may underſtand it here, <hi>Who can make a thunder-clap like God?</hi> Natural thunder is a token of Gods power, and 'tis a dreadful token. Should I expound and proſecute the Text in the letter, 'tis a great truth and of uſeful conſideration. The voice of God in thunder exceeds the voices of all men.</p>
                  <p>But in Scripture to <hi>thunder</hi> is often taken improperly, and ſo it ſignifieth any mighty ſpeaking or ſpeaking with mighty effect.<note place="margin">
                        <p>Hoc inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to efficar Dei juſſio ſiſtens atque exhibens quicquid vult ſignificatur. <hi>Loc.</hi>

                        </p>
                     </note> Hence thoſe two eminent Apoſtles (<hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi>) were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Boanerges,</hi> that is, <hi>Sons of Thunder,</hi> becauſe they preached ſo powerfully for the converſion and ſalvation of ſinners. And in the <hi>Chapter</hi> before the Text (<hi>Job</hi> 39.25.) we read of the <hi>thunder of the Captains,</hi> that is, of the Captains loud voice, giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exhortations, orders, and commands, to their Army ready for battel. The power that goeth forth with the Word of God, is the thunder of his voice. It was ſaid of <hi>Pericles,</hi> a great Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour among the <hi>Grecians,</hi> that he did thunder and lighten upon his Auditors; ſuch was the power of his Rhetorick, that he did ſhake, as it were, that whole country with his voyce.</p>
                  <pb n="559" facs="tcp:48669:291"/>
                  <p>Now, as in the former queſtion, the Lord ſet forth his mighty ſtrength, in acting, by his <hi>arm, Haſt thou an arm like God?</hi> So here he ſeeteth forth his mighty power, in ſpeaking, by <hi>thunder, Canſt thou thunder with a voice like him?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence, Note;
<q>The voice of the Lord is a powerful voice.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>To thunder is to ſpeak, but it is no ordinary ſpeaking, that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by it. To thunder is to ſpeak, not only weightily, but power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, ſomewhat paſſionately, if not diſpleaſedly, and with a mighty impreſſing force, as alſo with an extenſion and intention of the voice. <hi>To lift up the voice like a trumpet</hi> (as the Prophet was commanded, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.1.) hath all this in it, much more to lift up the voice like thunder; and ſuch is the voice of God. The ſtrongeſt and moſt ſtentorean voice of man is but a whiſper, and cannot ſtartle a Mouſe, or give me leave to ſay (as we proverbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſay) the ſtrongeſt and moſt muſical-mouthed man, ſpeaks but <hi>like a Mouſe in a Cheeſe,</hi> his voice is indeed a meer ſilence in compariſon of the thunder of Gods voice. The whole 29th <hi>Pſalme</hi> is a proof of it; which though it be true of the natural thunder, yet 'tis chiefly to underſtood (as hath been ſhewed) of the metaphorical or ſpiritual thunder, the power that goeth forth with the ſpeakings of God. And that there is a thunder, a mighty power, accompanying the Word of God, may appear in theſe particulars.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The bare <hi>ſaying voice of God</hi> is exceeding powerful. To ſay a thing, is as little as may be towards the effecting of it. But if God do but ſay, let ſuch a thing be, it is ſo; yea, his ſaying (no more is expreſt) gave all things a Being: He only ſaid, <hi>Let there be light, and there was light,</hi> &amp;c. (<hi>Gen.</hi> 3.3.) That ſaying was a commanding, as the Apoſtle expounds it (2 <hi>Cor</hi> 4.6.) <hi>God who commanded light to ſhine out of darkneſs,</hi> &amp;c. The ſaying voice of God hath a commanding power in it, that is, every thing is done and cometh to paſs as he ſaith (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.6.) <hi>By the word of the Lord were the heavens made, and all the hoaſt of them, by the breath of his mouth.</hi> And if the whole world was the product of a word from God, what cannot God produce in the world, by ſpeaking the word?</p>
                  <pb n="560" facs="tcp:48669:292"/>
                  <p>Secondly, How powerful is the expreſsly or directly <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding voice of God,</hi> if his ſaying voice be ſo powerful! When the Lord gave the Law (<hi>Exod.</hi> 19.16.) what <hi>voices?</hi> what <hi>thunderings</hi> were then heard! The ſaying of God is a virtual command, but he gives formal commands alſo. And when he gave the Law or Ten Commandements, the thunder of his voice made all <hi>the people tremble, and ſtand afar off:</hi> And if (as that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath often been well enforc'd) God thundered with ſuch a voice at the giving of the law, with what a dreadful voice will he thunder when he comes to Judge thoſe who have broken, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitently continu'd in the breach of the law.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, There is a mighty power, as in the bidding, ſo in the <hi>forbidding or reſtraining voice of God.</hi> He by the voice of his word can put a ſtop to creatures, when they are in their ſtrongeſt career and ſwifteſt motion. What is ſwifter in motion than the Sun? All creatures on earth or in the air, are but ſluggs to the Sun; the Eagle upon her wing is but a Snail to the Sun: yet God can forbid the Suns motion (<hi>Job</hi> 9.7.) <hi>He commandeth the Sun, and it riſeth not;</hi> That is, if he ſend forth a prohibition to the Sun, it will not ſtir forwards one foot, till he takes off his prohibition, and bids it fulfill its wonted courſe; as in <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua</hi>'s dayes (<hi>Chap.</hi> 10.12.) and at his command it will go backward, as in the dayes of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> (2 <hi>Kings</hi> 20.11.) Further, The Lords voice diſanuls and makes void the commands of any creature (<hi>Lam.</hi> 3.32.) <hi>Who is he that ſaith it, and it cometh to paſs, if the Lord have not commanded it?</hi> They reckon (as we ſay) without their hoſt, who hope to carry on any work with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Gods concurrence; for he can g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ve a negative to all our affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and make all our wheels, either ſtand ſtill or go backward.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, There is a thunder in the <hi>teaching voice</hi> of God. His teaching voice is a very ſtill voice, yet 'tis a very ſtrong voice; the ſoul falls down at the ſound of it. 'Tis promiſed (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.13.) that <hi>we ſhall be all taught of God,</hi> that is, effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually taught; ſo taught, as to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eceive inſtruction. The teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing voice of God, makes the ignorant knowing, and the fooliſh wiſe. <hi>The Lord</hi> (ſaid the Prophet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.11.) <hi>ſpake unto me with a ſtrong hand, and inſtructed me, that I ſhould not walk in the way of this people.</hi> There had need be a ſtrong hand in the voice of that inſtruction, which keeps us out of the common walks of
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:48669:292"/> the world. Yet, there is ſuch a power in the teaching voice of God, that like a thunder-bolt, it over-throweth and <hi>ſo pulls down all the ſtrong-holds of ſin, caſting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth it ſelf againſt the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Chriſt</hi> (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4, 5.) Thus God thunders againſt ſin, and batters ſinners; which is infinitely harder to do, than to battel and level the walls of a City to the ground with thundering Cannon. The weapons of our warfare, for the conqueſt of ſouls to Chriſt, are all laid up in, and fetcht out of the Arcenal of the holy Scriptures or Word of God; and, O what work have they made in the world! How many have fallen, by ſubmitting to them, to their own ſalvation! and how many more have fallen, by reſiſting them, to their own everlaſting deſruction!</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, There is a mighty power in the <hi>reproving voice of God.</hi> When God deals verbal rebukes to ſinners, as well as verberal, he often <hi>makes their beauty to conſume away like a moth (Pſal.</hi> 39.11.) The Lord profeſſeth to all hardned ſinners, whoſe conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences now give them no reproofs, and who preſume God will give them none neither, that he hath thundering reproofs ready for them (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.21.) <hi>I will reprove thee, and ſet them</hi> (that is, thy ſins) <hi>in order before thine eyes. O conſider this</hi> (as 'tis ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed in the next verſe of the ſame <hi>Pſalm) ye that forget God, leſt he tear you in pieces,</hi> with the thunder of his reproof.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, There is alſo a mighty power in <hi>the comforting voice of God.</hi> O what a vertue is there in thoſe ſecret whiſpers, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God ſpeaketh peace to his people (<hi>Hoſea</hi> 2.14.) <hi>I will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure her, and bring her into the wilderneſs, and ſpeak comfortably unto her,</hi> or <hi>to her heart.</hi> A thunder (as to power) goeth with this voice of God: This hath a power to ſettle a ſhaking or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſolate ſoul, and nothing but the power of Gods voice can do that. When none can comfort, the Lord can. <hi>To comfort the conſcience is</hi> (ſaid <hi>Luther) as great a work as to make a world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Seaventhly, There is a mighty power, as <hi>in the promiſing or comforting voice of God,</hi> ſo alſo in his <hi>threatning voice.</hi> The Lord thunders reproofs againſt thoſe that have ſinned, and he thunders threatnings to keep all from ſinning; and how terrible that voice i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the Apoſtle knew, who ſaid, <hi>Knowing the terrour of the Lord we perſwade men</hi> (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11.) And as the Apoſtle knew it
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:48669:293"/> by believing it, ſo all final unbelievers ſhall know it by their ſenſe and feeling of it.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, There is a thunder of power in the <hi>propheſying voice of God.</hi> When the Lord fore-tells what ſhall come to paſs, who can withſtand it? We find thoſe propheſies, which hold forth the ruin of Chriſts enemies and of his Church, ſhewred in with thunder (<hi>Rev.</hi> 8.15. and <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.19.) which did not only ſhew that thoſe propheſies ſhould be certainly and ſolemnly fulfilled in their ſeaſon, but that they ſhould be terribly fulfilled, or full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled with a terror, like that of thunder. All propheſies ſhall ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually come to paſs and be fulfilled; therefore power is in them.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, What a power is there in the <hi>ſwearing voice of God.</hi> Firſt, God ſwears ſometimes in his wrath (he did ſo againſt that people of old) <hi>I ſware to them in my wrath, that they ſhould not enter into my reſt:</hi> And ſo powerful was that oath, that not a man of them could come into <hi>Canaan, their Carcaſſes fell in the wilderneſs.</hi> And as when rhe Lord ſwears in wrath; ſo, Secondly, When he ſwears in love and mercy, there's irreſiſtible power in that alſo. Thus God ſware and made oath to <hi>Abraham (Heb.</hi> 6.17.) <hi>Wherein God willing more abundantly to ſhew unto the heirs of promiſe, the immutability of his counſel, confirmed it by an oath; that by two immutable things, in which it was impoſſible for God to lye, we might have ſtrong conſolation,</hi> &amp;c. To <hi>David</hi> alſo God ſware in love (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.35, 36.) <hi>Once have I ſworn by my holineſs, that I will not lye unto</hi> David. <hi>His ſeed ſhall endure forever, and his throne as the Sun before me,</hi> &amp;c. The oath or ſwearing voice of God is ſo ſtrong, that we have reaſon enough both of ſtrong fears, when he ſweareth in wrath, as he did againſt the children of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and of ſtrong conſolation, when he ſweareth in love, as he did to <hi>Abraham</hi> and to <hi>David.</hi> And wo to thoſe who believe not when God ſwears either in wrath or in love.</p>
                  <p>Tenthly, There is a mighty power in the <hi>Judging voice of God.</hi> When he ſhall ſpeak from his throne in that great day, what a thunder will there be in his voice? When in that Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-day he ſhall acquit his elect, that voice will have a raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power in it: And when his condemning ſentence ſhall be pronounced againſt the wicked, that voice will have an aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power in it, beyond that of thunder. And it is to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:48669:293"/> that in many places of Scripture, where the eminent judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God are mentioned, his voice or thunder is mentioned, as going before or accompanying, thoſe ſolemn and tremendous diſpenſations (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.13. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.33, 34, 35. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.30. <hi>Jer.</hi> 25.30. <hi>Joel</hi> 4.16.)</p>
                  <p>To conclude this point, ſeeing there is a power, like that of thunder, going forth with the voice of God, in the effectual mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations of his Word; let us well conſider, whether God hath ſpoken to us effectually, yea or no; have we known the thunder of his Spirit? hath there come a mighty power upon us, with the voice of his Word? if the voice hath not reach't our hearts, and reformed our lives, we have not heard the thunder of Gods voice, but only the voice of man, or a ſound in the air beating the outward ear. Naturaliſts ſay from experience, that by the power of thunder and lightning, the ſword is ſometimes melted, while the ſcabbard is unhurt. And from experience, they that are ſpiritual can alſo ſay, that the thunder of Gods voice melteth the ſoul, while it only toucheth the ear. Therefore we have reaſon diligently to enquire, what power hath come with the word ſpoken; have we found the commanding, the promiſing, the threatning, the inſtructing, the comforting voices of God ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual upon our hearts? Bleſſed are they who have been thus thunder-ſtruck. And all they who have been thus ſtrucken out of themſelves and into Chriſt, may truly ſay, what that people ſaid flattering and blaſphemouſly, at the Oration of <hi>Herod (Acts</hi> 12.22.) <hi>It is the voice of God, and not of man.</hi> Though the ſound of the words came in mans voice, yet the power of them came in Gods voice; for <hi>who can thunder with a voice like him?</hi> or who indeed hath any thing like ſuch thunder in his voice but he?</p>
                  <p>Further, the Lords deſign being to humble <hi>Job,</hi> in putting theſe queſtions, <hi>Haſt thou an arm like God? or canſt thou thunder with a voice like him?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note;
<q>Man is never convinced, either of his own weakneſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs, till he is taught to conſider the power, greatneſs, and mightineſs of God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Till God is great and high in our thoughts, we are great and
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:48669:294"/> high in our own: And when God is great in our eyes, we are little in our own, and ſo are all things elſe; then our power is nothing to the power of God, our holineſs nothing to the holineſs of God, our wiſdom nothing to the wiſdom of God.

                     </gap> good thus to compare our ſelves with God, that we may ſee and be convinced, how infinitely below God we are in all that we have and are. <hi>David</hi> ſaid (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.5.) <hi>Mine age is as nothing before thee.</hi> It is ſo in all other things; our wiſdom is nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, our holineſs is nothing before God, our ſtrength is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing before God. As thoſe ſearchers of <hi>Canaan</hi> ſaid (<hi>Numb.</hi> 13.33.) <hi>We ſaw the Giants there, and we were as Graſhoppers in their ſight.</hi> We thought our ſelves tall men, before we ſaw thoſe high-ſtatur'd Giants; but having ſeen them, we were but Pigmies, yet, but as Graſhoppers. So we think we have a great deal of power, and wiſdom, and holineſs, till we look upon God, and then we are convinced of our own meanneſs and poverty. The Apoſtle ſaith in higheſt truth and honeſty, as well as mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.12.) <hi>We dare not make our ſelves of the number, or compare our ſelves with ſome that commend themſelves; but they meaſuring themſelves by themſelves, and comparing themſelves amongſt themſelves are not wiſe.</hi> And why not wiſe? becauſe they ſeem to be too wiſe, or think themſelves very wiſe. We get ſome opinion of our own wiſdom, and holineſs, and goodneſs, and righteouſneſs, comparing our ſelves with men like our ſelves; but if we would compare our ſelves with God, we ſhould ſoon ſee what poor things we are. What pitiful creatures do we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear when compared with our Creatour! and we ſhall have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited well by this Scripture, if we make this uſe of it; and leave priding our ſelves as men, by comparing our ſelves with men. One man ſaith, I am as good as that man; and another ſaith, I am as wiſe as that man; and a third ſaith, I am as holy as ſuch a man. O that we would but think what the goodneſs, wiſdom, and holineſs of God are: ſuch holy thoughts wrought upon the heart, will free us from all high thoughts of our ſelves, and then we ſhall look for our all in Jeſus Chriſt; then, as the Prophet gives us the true form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-ſpeaking (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.24.) <hi>Surely ſhall one ſay, in the Lord I have righteouſneſs and ſtrength.</hi> And ſo will every one ſay who ſeeth (which is true of all men) that his own ſtrength is weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and his righteouſneſs a filthy rag, compared with the ſtrength
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:48669:294"/> and righteouſneſs of God: Our arm, our voice, our ſelf-all, or our all of ſelf, will vaniſh and diſappear, if once God appear to us in the glory of his arm and voice. <hi>Haſt thou an arm like God? or canſt thou thunder with a voice like him?</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>So then, as in the former verſe, we had a compariſon between <hi>Jobs</hi> power and the power of God, by way of interrogation, <hi>Haſt thou an arm like God?</hi> ſo here God doth the ſame thing with <hi>Job,</hi> by an ironical injunction, juſſion or command; <hi>Deck
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:48669:295"/> thy ſelf with majeſty;</hi> let us ſee what a man thou art, put thy ſelf into thy faireſt dreſs, and moſt tremendous appearance.</p>
                  <p>There are two things in this context, in which <hi>Job</hi> is called to ſhew himſelf like God, if he could.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, In the majeſty and excellency, in the glory and beauty of his perſon (<hi>ver.</hi> 10.) <hi>Deck thy ſelf with majeſty,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, In the mighty effects of his anger and diſpleaſure, (<hi>ver.</hi> 11.) <hi>Caſt abroad the rage of thy wrath,</hi> &amp;c. And this the Lord bids him do; Firſt, More particularly, <hi>In abaſing the proud.</hi> Secondly, More generally, <hi>In deſtroying all the wicked of the earth. (ver.</hi> 12, 13.) Now in caſe <hi>Job</hi> could approve himſelf thus pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful, and appear like God, either in the majeſty of his perſon, or in the mightineſs of his diſpleaſure againſt proud and wicked men, then ſaith the Lord (<hi>ver.</hi> 14.) <hi>I will confeſs unto thee, that thine own right hand can ſave thee,</hi> that is, I will yield thee the cauſe, I will acknowledge that thou, who canſt thus bring down the pride of men in the height of their iniquity, art alſo able to help thy ſelf out of all thy miſery; yea, that thou art able to contend with me, who often have done, and ſtill can do theſe great things with eaſe, with the turning of my hand, with a word of my mouth; yea, then I will confeſs that thou art as I am, that thou art God as I am: But alas poor worm, thou canſt do none of theſe things, therefore humble thy ſelf and be quiet under mine afflicting hand. This ſeems to be the general ſcope of the holy Ghoſt in theſe five verſes, even yet further to convince <hi>Job,</hi> that he had not an arm like God, nor could thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with a voice like him, foraſmuch as he could not put forth ſuch acts, nor ſhew ſuch effects of power as God both had and could put forth and ſhew in the face of all the world.</p>

                  <p>Kings and Princes are decked with majeſty and excellency at all times, a majeſtick excellency is inherent in their eſtate; and when they ſhew themſelves in ſtate, or ſhew their ſtate, they put on their Crowns and Robes.

                     </note> which is our beſt ſuit on earth, is ſometimes called glory (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18.) <hi>We are changed from glory to glory, as by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Lord;</hi> that is, f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>om grace to grace. Mans firſt change is from ſin to grace, his ſecond is from grace to grace, or from one degree of grace to another. Grace is glory begun, and glory is grace perfected. Now, as glory is mans beſt ſuit, ſo glory is, as I may ſay, Gods beſt ſuit. He is, as the <hi>God of all grace</hi> (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.10.) ſo <hi>the God of all glory;</hi> for all glory is to be given unto him, and his glory will he not give to any other. The glory of God is twofold. Firſt, Eſſential and internal, for ever unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably abiding in himſelf; indeed the very Eſſence of God is glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Of this we read (<hi>Exod.</hi> 33.18.) <hi>I will make all my goodneſs paſs before thee, I will proclaim the name of the Lord before thee, and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will ſhew mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to whom I will ſhew mercy;</hi> this kind of glory I will ſhew thee, but <hi>thou canſt not ſee my face and live,</hi> that is, my eſſential glory.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There is a providential or external glory of God; the manifeſtations of God in his greatneſs, goodneſs and power, are his glory. Thus 'tis ſaid at the dedication of <hi>Solomons</hi> Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.11.) <hi>The glory of the Lord filled the houſe of the Lord;</hi> that is, there was a glorious and wonderful manifeſtation of the preſence of the Lord in his houſe. Whatever God mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſts of himſelf, whether his power, or his goodneſs, or his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, or his grace, or his patience, or his juſtice, is his glory. The Lord often arrayeth himſelf with theſe glories; that is, he declares both by his word and by his works, that he is powerful, good, merciful, gracious, patient and juſt towards the children of men. The Scripture calleth God <hi>the glory of his people (Pſal.</hi> 106.20.) that is, it is the glory of any people, or that which they ſhould glory in, that God is known to them, or that they are owned by God. But the idolatrizing <hi>Jews changed their glory into the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of an Ox that eateth graſs;</hi> that is, they changed God, who was their glory, and in whom they ſhould have gloried, into the form of an in-glorious beaſt, while they either worſhipped the image of a beaſt, or their God in that image.</p>
                  <p>And it is conſiderable, that the Apoſtle (<hi>Rom.</hi> 1.23.) at leaſt alluding to (as the reference in our Bible intimates) if not quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that place laſt mentioned in the <hi>Pſalm,</hi> whilſt he ſpeaks of the
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:48669:296"/> idolatrous Gentiles, doth not ſay (as there) <hi>They changed their glory,</hi> &amp;c. for the true God was not the glory of the Gentiles in thoſe dayes, they owned him not as their only God (having many Idol gods) nor did he own them as his people; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle did not, nor could he in truth ſay of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, <hi>They changed their glory,</hi> &amp;c. But thus he ſaith, <hi>They changed the glory of the incorruptible God, into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and four-footed beaſts, and creeping things.</hi> The Gentiles did not change the incorruptible God, their glory into an image, but they changed the glory of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible God into an image, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in that reſpect the ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry of the <hi>Jews</hi> (a people knowing the true God, yea, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying in him) was worſe than the idolatry of the Gentiles, who knew him not, nor ever gloried in him, nor accounted him their glory. But to the point in hand. As that is Gods glory which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſts his glory,</p>
                  <p>So in general, any thing which maketh man ſhine forth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendably or honourably to others, or gives him a preheminence above many others (as neer relation to God ſpecially doth) may be called his glory. Whatſoever is beſt in us, or to us, is our glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. The ſoul of man is his glory, becauſe it is his beſt part. The body is a poor thing to the ſoul; the body is but a ſhell, the ſoul is the kernel; the body is but the ſheath (as the <hi>Chaldee</hi> calls it, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.15.) the ſoul is the ſword, though uſually we take more pains for the body than for the ſoul, as if we prized it more. When <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid (<hi>Gen.</hi> 49.6.) <hi>O my ſoul, come thou not into their ſecret; unto their aſſembly, mine honour, be not thou united;</hi> he meant (ſome ſay) the ſame thing by his ſoul, and by his honour or glory, becauſe the ſoul is the moſt glorious and honourable part in man, and that which men ſhould be moſt careful of. Thus likewiſe the tongue of man is called his glory (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 57.8.) <hi>Awake my glory,</hi> that is, my tongue. The tongue being that organ or inſtrument where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the wiſdom and prudence of man is held forth, and he made glorious in the world, 'tis therefore called his glory. The tongue of man is alſo called his glory, becauſe with that he giveth glory to God by praiſing him, and confeſſing his name, together with his truth, unto ſalvation. And as glory is the beſt of man, ſo of any other creature (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.61.) <hi>There is one glory of the Sun, and another of the Moon, and another glory of the Stars; for one Star

And here the Lord is pleaſed to imploy many words to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, to ſhew what great ſtate he had need be in that contends with him: As if he had ſaid, <hi>O</hi> Job, <hi>although thou didſt not ſit upon a dunghil, or wert not bound to thy bed by the cords of thy affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but didſt ſit upon a Kingly throne, ſhining in robes of royalty, couldſt thou in all thoſe ornaments equal thy ſelf to me, in majeſty and excellency, in glory and beauty? Deck thy ſelf with majeſty and excellency,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Hence note, Firſt;
<q>God himſelf is full of Majeſty, of Excellency, of Glory, and of Beauty.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I put them all together in one Obſervation, becauſe the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of them all is one. The Scripture often ſets forth the Lord thus adorned, thus decked (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 93.1.) <hi>The Lord reigneth, he is cloathed with majeſty, he is cloathed with ſtrength, wherewith he hath girded himſelf.</hi> Again (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.6.) <hi>Honour and maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty are before him, ſtrength &amp; beauty are in his ſanctuary</hi> (Pſal. 104.1.) <hi>Bleſs the Lord, O my ſoul; O Lord, my God, thou art very great, thou art cloathed with honour and majeſty.</hi> This cloathing, this array, which the Lord called <hi>Job</hi> to put on, is properly his own; and though God will not give his glory to another, yet
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:48669:297"/> here he bids <hi>Job</hi> take his glory, and ſhew himſelf in it to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt if he could. Many have affected or invaded Gods glory, but none could ever attain or reach it. God calls man really to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of glory with him, but man cannot take his glory upon him and be man. The humane nature of Chriſt could never have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived nor born that glory, but as united to, and ſubſiſting in the perſon of the Son of God, according to that prayer of his (<hi>John</hi> 17.5.)</p>
                  <p>More diſtinctly; If God be thus cloathed, Then</p>
                  <p>Firſt, We ſhould tremble before him. Majeſty is dreadful. The majeſty of Kings, who in nature are but men, is very dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; how much more the majeſty of God, who is King of Kings, the King immortal, and reigns for ever. We have this trembling three times repeated, with reſpect to the majeſty of God (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.10, 19, 21.) where the mightieſt and greateſt of the world, called there high Mountains and ſtrong Towers, Oaks and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dars, are ſaid to <hi>go into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves of the earth, for fear of the Lord, and for the glory of his Majeſty, when he ariſeth to ſhake terribly the earth.</hi> And though the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God have great cauſe to rejoyce at his majeſty, as 'tis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied they ſhall (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 24.14.) <hi>They ſhall lift up their voices, they ſhall ſing for the majeſty of the Lord</hi> (nothing cauſeth the hearts of the righteous to rejoyce, more than the majeſty of God) yet they ought to rejoyce, and ſo they do, with trembling (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.11.) or with a holy awe of God impreſſed upon their hearts; for the majeſty of God is a very dreadful, tremendous, awful majeſty. And the more we have truly taſted the goodneſs and mercy of God, the more ſhall we tremble at his majeſty; yea, the Lord will have his majeſty not only taken notice of, but trembled at; and therefore he reproves thoſe (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.10.) <hi>who would not behold his majeſty.</hi> The majeſty of the Lord, like himſelf, cannot be ſeen or beheld in it ſelf, yet it ſheweth it ſelf many wayes, though few behold it, or tremble at it; and the reaſon why they tremble not at it, is, becauſe they do not, or rather (as the Prophet there ſpeaks) <hi>will not behold it,</hi> no, not when it ſhines in the plaineſt demonſtrations, whether of wrath againſt wicked men, or of love and mercy to the godly, as clearly as the Sun at noon day.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As we ſhould tremble at the majeſty of the Lord, ſo admire his excellency; they that excel others, eſpecially they
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:48669:298"/> who excel all others in any kind, are much admired. The Lord is cloathed with excellency, how then ſhould we admire him! and ſay, <hi>Who is a God like unto thee? This God is our God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Seeing the Lord is cloathed with glory, we ſhould glorifie him; and that, Firſt, in his eſſential glory, Secondly, in the glory of his acts and operations. We ſhould glorifie him for the greatneſs of his power, eſpecially for the greatneſs of his grace, becauſe the grace and mercy of God are his glory; as the Apoſtle ſpake in that prayer (<hi>Eph.</hi> 3.16.) <hi>That he would grant you according to the riches of his glory</hi> (that is, of his grace and favour towards you) <hi>to be ſtrengthned with might by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, in the inner man.</hi> And as the grace and goodneſs of God is his glory, ſo alſo is his holineſs (<hi>Exod.</hi> 15.11.) <hi>Who is a God like unto thee, glorious in holineſs?</hi> Let us glorifie God, in and for all his glories, in and for the glory of his power, mercy, grace and holineſs.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>God is arrayed with beauty.</hi> Beauty is a taking thing; then how ſhould our ſouls delight in the Lord! We delight in things that are beautiful, we love beauty; how ſhould this draw forth our love, our affections to God! All the beauty of the world is but a blot, 'tis darkneſs, and a ſtained thing, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of the Lords beauty, the beauty of his holineſs; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if we have a love to beauty, let us love the Lord, who is ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayed with beauty, even with the perfection of beauty.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, In general; Seeing the Lord is <hi>deckt with majeſty and excellency, arrayed with glory and beauty,</hi> let us continually aſcribe all theſe to God. What God is, and hath ſhewed himſelf to be, we ſhould ſhew forth (1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.11.) <hi>Thine, O Lord</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) is the greatneſs, and the power, and the glory, and the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, and the majeſty; for all that is in heaven and in earth is thine. David</hi> aſcribed all to God there, as alſo (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.10.) <hi>All thy works praiſe thee, O Lord, and thy Saints ſhall bleſs thee; they ſhall ſpeak of the glory of thy Kingdom, and talk of thy power, to make known to the ſons of men his mighty acts, and the glorious majeſty of his Kingdom: thy Kingdom is an everlaſting Kingdom, and thy dominion endureth throughout all generations.</hi> Thus Saints are to blazon the name of God, and to make his praiſe glorious. The Apoſtle <hi>Jude</hi> concludes his Epiſtle with this Doxology; <hi>To the only wiſe God our Saviour</hi> (that is, Jeſus Chriſt) <hi>be glory, and
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:48669:298"/> majeſty, and dominion, and power, now and ever, Amen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Further, to remember the majeſty and excellency of God, may and ſhould be,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, an incouragement to ſerve him. Who would not ſerve a Prince, who is decked with majeſty and excellency, who is array<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with glory and beauty? who would not ſerve ſuch a King as this? How ambitious are men to ſerve thoſe who are deckt with worldly majeſty and excellency? ſhall not we have a holy am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition to ſerve the Lord, who is thus decked and arrayed!</p>
                  <p>Secondly, This may exceedingly hearten and embolden us againſt all the danger we may meet with in the Lords ſervice. If we encounter with hardſhips and hazards in Gods work, let us remember, he that is cloathed with majeſty and excellency, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> can protect us in his ſervice, and reward us for it; we can loſe nothing by him, though we ſhould loſe all for him, life and all.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, This ſhould fill our ſouls with reverential thoughts of God continually. Did we know the Lord in theſe divine diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries of himſelf, in his <hi>majeſty and excellency, in his glory and beauty,</hi> how would our hearts be filled with high thoughts of him! we would neither ſpeak nor think of God, but with a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious awe upon our ſpirits.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, This ſhould provoke us in all holy duties to do our beſt. The Lord reproved the <hi>Jews (Mal.</hi> 1.8.) when they brought him a poor lean ſacrifice; <hi>Offer it now unto thy Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, will he be pleaſed with thee, or accept thy perſon?</hi> Shall we put off God, who is full of majeſty and excellency, of glory and beauty, with poor, weak and ſickly ſervices, ſuch as our Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, men in high place &amp; power will not accept from our hands, but turn back with diſdain upon our hands. The worſhip and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God conſiſts not in a bodily exerciſe, nor in any outward beauty; he is a ſpirit, and <hi>must be worſhipped in ſpirit and in truth;</hi> that is, in truth of heart, and according to the truth of his word, which the Apoſtle calls <hi>the ſimplicity that is in Christ</hi> (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.3.) The glory and beauty of God is ſpiritual, and the beauty that he muſt be ſerved with, is, above all, the inward beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of faith and love, and holy fear in our hearts.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, If God be thus deckt with majeſty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This may aſſure us in praying to him and calling upon him, that we ſhall
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:48669:299"/> not ſeek him in vain: It is worth the while to attend ſuch a God, and pour out our hearts before him. We may ſafely depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God for all, ſeeing majeſty and excellency are his. The Lords prayer by which we are to form, or unto which we ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form all our prayers concludes with this, <hi>thine is the kingdom, power and glory;</hi> all is thine, and therefore we have great encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to ask all of <hi>thee.</hi> Men can give to thoſe that ask them, according to the extent of their power. There is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence or comprehenſion of all power in the majeſty, excellency, and glory of God, and therefore he can give whatſoever we ask.</p>
                  <p>Now, as, that God is thus deckt and arrayed with majeſty and excellency, is implied in this Text; ſo 'tis alſo implied, that he hath thus deckt himſelf, while he ſaith to <hi>Job,</hi>
                     <q>Deck thy ſelf with majeſty and excellency.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence obſerve, Secondly;
<q>The majeſty and excellency, the glory and beauty of God, are all of and from himſelf.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He is the fountain as of his own being, ſo of the majeſty and excellency, of the glory and beauty of his being; he decks and arrays himſelf, he is not decked by others. Moraliſts ſay, <hi>honour is not or reſides not in him that is honoured, but in him that honoureth;</hi> yet here honour is ſeated in him that is honoured. We honour God, and give glory to him, but we cannot add any honour to him, all is originally in himſelf; he is the beginning without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his own majeſty. And as Gods majeſty is his own, ſo of his own putting on; he borroweth nothing from the creature, nor needs he any creature to deck him. He is not what others will make him or have him to be, but what he is, he is of and from himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Obſerve;
<q>The majeſty and glory of the greateſt among men, is the gift of God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Deck thy ſelf with majeſty,</hi> ſaith God to <hi>Job;</hi> but <hi>Job</hi> could not deck himſelf; he could not p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>t a clothing of majeſty, and excellency, of glory and beauty upon himſelf. All that man hath is received from God, and is but a ray from his unconceiveable
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:48669:299"/> light. As all our ſpiritual a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ray, deckings and ornaments, are put on us by God (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.10, 11.) <hi>I cloathed thee with broidered work, I covered thee with ſilk, I decked thee alſo with ornaments, I put a jewel on thy forehead,</hi> &amp;c. So all civil ornaments are put on man by God. <hi>I girded thee</hi> (ſaid God of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> Iſa. 45.5.) <hi>though thou haſt not known me;</hi> that is, I gave thee all thy power and greatneſs, thy honour and dignity, though thou tookeſt no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of me in doing it, nor that I did it. Thus it is ſaid of <hi>Solomon</hi> (1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.25.) <hi>The Lord magnified</hi> Solomon <hi>exceedingly in the ſight of all</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and beſtowed upon him ſuch royal majeſty, as had not been on any king before him in</hi> Iſrael. And thus ſpake <hi>Daniel</hi> to <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhazzar,</hi> concerning his father <hi>Nebuchadnezar (Dan.</hi> 5.19.) <hi>And for the majeſty that he</hi> (that is, God) <hi>gave him, all Nations, Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and Languages, trembled and feared before him.</hi> All the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and excellency, all the glory and beauty of the greateſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs, is derived from God.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Obſerve;
<q>The majeſty and excellency, the glory and beauty of man, is nothing to Gods.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Chriſt ſaith (<hi>Mat.</hi> 6.29.) Solomon <hi>in all his glory was not arrayed like one of theſe. Solomon</hi> was a King in the greateſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and excellency, glory and beauty of any that ever was in the world; yet ſaith Chriſt, he was not decked like one of theſe Lillies: then how far ſhort did his glory fall of the glory of God! how doth all the glory of the world vaniſh and diſappear at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the glory of <hi>God,</hi> even as the luſtre of the moon &amp; ſtars doth at the riſing of the thrice illuſtrious Sun! And as mans glory is nothing to Gods, while it laſts or endures, ſo it is nothing to his in the laſtingneſs and duration of it. <hi>Dominion and majeſty are Gods, and ſhall be aſcribed to God everlaſtingly.</hi> It is ſaid of <hi>Aha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuerus (Eſther</hi> 1.4.) that he ſhewed the riches of his glorious kingdom, and the honour of his excellent Majeſty <hi>many days, even a hundred and fourſcore</hi> days; but the Lord ſheweth his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Majeſty for ever and ever, for it abides for ever: and if ſo, what is the majeſty of man compared with the Lords (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.6.) <hi>All fleſh is graſs, and the goodlineſs of it, as the flower of the field.</hi> The majeſty and excellency, the glory and beauty of man, is but the <hi>goodlineſs of fleſh,</hi> or the beſt of a fleſhly, earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:48669:300"/> ſtate; and what is that, but the goodlineſs of a fading flower, or of the graſs that is cut down and withers, yea, which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times withers before it is cut down, as <hi>David</hi> ſaith (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 129.6, 7.) the graſs doth upon <hi>the houſe tops, which withereth afore it groweth up; wherewith the mower filleth not his hand, nor he that bindeth ſheaves his boſome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, note;
<q>The way to lay the creature low, is to conſider the Majeſty of God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Why doth the Lord call <hi>Job</hi> to deck himſelf with humane ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and excellency? was it not to bring him to a due conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his own divine majeſty and excellency? <hi>Job</hi> muſt compare himſelf with God in his glory, that he might fall down convinced, that himſelf had no glory.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Lord ſhewed <hi>Job</hi> his own meanneſs and exility, by bidding him imitate the divine Majeſty and excellency.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Lord calls him further, to imitate him, if he could, in the mighty effects of his power or in his powerful works, againſt proud and wicked men.</p>

                     <pb n="577" facs="tcp:48669:300"/>Behold every one that is proud and abaſe him.</q>
                  <p>Go, look upon proud ones in thine anger, deal with them as they deſerve. The word implies more than bare beholding.</p>
                  <p>There is a twofold beholding of things or perſons.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, With favour, delight and pleaſure (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.18. and 34.15.) In both places the Lord is repreſented, beholding or caſting an eye upon his people, with grace and favour, for their good and comfort.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There is a beholding with anger and diſpleaſure; that is the meaning here: behold every one that is proud, behold them all, not only to take notice of them who they are, but behold them as I do, in wrath and anger, <hi>Behold</hi>
                     <q>Every one that is proud.</q>

                  <p>Here is an elegant repetition of the ſame thing, almoſt in the ſame words, meerly to inforce the matter <hi>look on every one that is proud,</hi> bend thy brows, look frowningly upon him, as if thou wouldſt look him thorough.</p>

                  <p>Hence note, Firſt;
<q>There is wrath in God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>God knoweth how to caſt forth his wrath as well as to ſend forth his love,<note place="margin">Habet ira Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini ſuam e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nergiam nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam egredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur vana.</note> or <hi>ſhed it abroad</hi> (as the Apoſtles word is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.5.) in the hearts of his juſtified ones, by the holy Ghoſt, which is given unto them. <hi>The wrath of God</hi> (ſaith the ſame Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.18.) <hi>is revealed from heaven againſt all ungodlineſs and unrighteouſneſs of men, who hold the truth in unrighteouſneſs.</hi> The wrath of God is ſuch as we can neither, Firſt, withſtand, nor, Secondly, avoid; there's, no out-running, no making an eſcape from it, but only by Jeſus Chriſt, and therefore the Apoſtle gives that glory to him alone (1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.10.) <hi>Even Jeſus, which deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered us from the wrath to come.</hi> There is a wrath to come, which God will ſcatter over all this ſinful wicked world; bleſſed are they that are delivered from it. Yea, not only is there wrath in God, but a <hi>fierceneſs of wrath,</hi> terrible wrath, ſuch as will cauſe the wicked (as was ſaid before) <hi>to run into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves of the earth, for fear of the Lord, and for the glory of his majeſty, when he ariſeth to ſhake terribly the earth (Iſa.</hi> 2.19.)

                     </gap>o deliver us from this wrath, and from the fierceneſs of it. When wrath ſhall be caſt abroad upon the wicked world, that it falls not upon the godly, is the fruit of higheſt and freeſt love. And though they ſip of the cup, yet that they drink not the dregs of it is rich mercy (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 75.98.) <hi>In the hand of the Lord there is a cup, and the wine is red, it is full of mixture, and he powreth out the ſame</hi> (in this powring out (poſſibly) a godly man may drink ſomewhat of it, eſpecially in a time of common calamity) <hi>but the dregs thereof all the wicked of the earth ſhall wring them out and drink them.</hi> It is of the <hi>Lords mercy, and becauſe his compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons fail not,</hi> that we are delivered from the fierceneſs of his wrath, and from drinking the very dregs of the cup of his diſpleaſure.</p>
                  <p>Conſider further, upon whom this wrath will be exerciſed, <hi>Caſt

                     <hi>He beholds them, he locks upon them.</hi> As it is ſaid <hi>Saul</hi> (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.9.) <hi>He eyed</hi> David <hi>from that day forward,</hi> that is (which was his great ſin) he caſt a revengeful envious eye upon him: Thus when the holy God ſeeth wicked men g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ow lofty and proud, he eyeth and beholdeth them from that very day, with an eye of juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, or with a purpoſe to break them and be revenged on them. God beholds them, as I may ſay, with an evil eye, that is, with an intent to bring evil upon them. <hi>He</hi> (ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 138.6.) <hi>knoweth the proud afar off.</hi> As it is ſaid of the Father of the humbled Prodigal in the Parable, (<hi>Luke</hi> 15.) <hi>When he was yet a great way off, his father ſaw him, and had compaſſion.</hi> So God quickly ſpies out a proud man, even a great way off, and hath indignation againſt him; or, as we may rather expound the Pſalm, <hi>He knoweth the proud afar off;</hi> that is, a proud man ſhall never come near him, he will not admit him into his preſence, much leſs into his imbraces. To be known afar off, is to be far from the favourable or reſpectful knowledge of God; yea, to thoſe whom the Lord knows afar off in this world, he will ſay in the next, <hi>I never knew you, depart from me, ye workers of iniquity</hi> (Mat. 7.23.)</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Note;
<q>God is able to, and will caſt down proud men.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>That which he would have <hi>Job</hi> do, he himſelf (as was ſaid) uſually doth; <hi>He beholdeth the proud, and abaſeth them,</hi> he layeth them low. <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> that proud Monarch, was brought to that confeſſion (<hi>Dan.</hi> 4.37.) <hi>Now I</hi> Nebuchadnezzar <hi>praiſe, and honour, and extol the King of Heaven, all whoſe works are true, and his ways judgment, and thoſe that walk in pride he is able to abaſe.</hi> If men will be proud and lofty, the Lord both knoweth very well how, and is able very eaſily to bring them down. And as he knows how, and is able to deal with proud men, ſo he deſires and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights to deal with them, above all ſorts of ſinners; his greateſt conteſts are with the proud (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.12, 13, 14.) <hi>The day of
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:48669:302"/> the Lord of Hoſts ſhall be upon every one that is proud and lofty, and upon every one that is lifted up</hi> (in his own conceit eſpecially) <hi>and he ſhall be brought low, and upon all the Cedars of</hi> Lebanon, <hi>that are high and lifted up, and upon all the Oaks of</hi> Baſhan, <hi>and upon all the high mountains,</hi> &amp;c. What meaneth the Prophet by theſe? is the Lord angry with trees and mountains? Theſe are but the ſhadows of great and proud men; the day of the Lord ſhall be upon every one of them, and his hand will be heavy upon them in that day. Proud men look upon themſelves much above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; but as God is above them, ſo he loves to ſhew himſelf ahove them, eſpecially when they ſhew out their pride. As <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throe</hi> ſaid to <hi>Moſes (Exod.</hi> 18.9, 11.) <hi>Now I know that the Lord is greater than all gods, for in the thing wherein they dealt proudly he was above them.</hi> God ſheweth himſelf above all, when he acts above proud men, and acts them down in their proudeſt actings.</p>
                  <p>And as the Lord delights to <hi>bring proud men down;</hi> ſo he will certainly do it, he is reſolved upon it, <hi>He looketh upon every one that is proud to abaſe him.</hi> The Angels that fell were proud, <hi>they kept not their firſt eſtate, but left their habitation,</hi> they did not like the ſtate wherein God had placed them; and therefo e God caſt them down, <hi>and he hath reſerved them in everlaſting chains under darkneſs unto the judgment of the great day</hi> (Jude 6.) When man in Paradiſe began to be proud and would be more than God made him (God made him above all earthly creatures, but he would be as God, as his Creator; he would be, as it were, the founder of his own happineſs; pride and unbelief at once took hold of him and led him to his <hi>ſin-fall,</hi> and) then followed his fall, his <hi>judgment-fall;</hi> God caſt him down, God abaſed him, and not only that proud man, but man-kind for his pride; they being in him, his pride was theirs. And to this day God hath all along ſet his face againſt all proud men, and the pride of all men, (<hi>James</hi> 4.6.) <hi>God reſiſteth the proud.</hi> The proud contend with God, they, as it were, wage war with God, and therefore God will wage war and contend with them, he reſiſteth the proud (<hi>Prov.</hi> 3.34.) <hi>Surely he ſcorneth the ſcorner, but he giveth grace to the lowly.</hi> The Lord hath two great works to do in the world. The firſt is, to lift up and exalt the humble. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is, to humble and pull down the proud. Theſe two are the
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:48669:302"/> daily products of divine providence. And the Lord is ſo much an enemy to pride, that if he ſee it in any of his own ſervants, he will abaſe them and lay them low for it; as we ſee in the caſe of that good King <hi>Hezekiah, His heart being lifted up</hi> (not in thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, nor in zeal for the ways and things of God, as once it was, but in pride) <hi>there was wrath upon him, and upon</hi> Judah <hi>and Jeruſalem</hi> (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32.35.) The Lord will not bear it, when his own bear or behave themſelves proudly (<hi>Prov.</hi> 29.23.) <hi>A mans pride</hi> (any mans pride) <hi>ſhall bring him low;</hi> that is, he ſhall be brought low for his pride, or his pride will bring him into ſuch extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant wayes as will be a means to bring him low.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Note;
<q>God can eaſily abaſe and caſt down proud ones.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>If any ask, how eaſily can he do it? I anſwer, He can do it with a look; <hi>Look upon every one that is proud, and bring him low,</hi> ſaith God to <hi>Job,</hi> ſhew thy ſelf like me in this, <hi>I can do it as eaſily as look upon him.</hi> God by a caſt of his eye can caſt down all proud men; as the Lord can help his people with a look. <hi>David</hi> deſired no more for his portion, but that God would lift up the light of his countenance upon him (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.6.) that is, that God would look upon him favourably: And that prayer is made three times (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 80 4, 7, 19.) <hi>Cauſe thy face to ſhine up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, and</hi> (we have enough) <hi>we ſhall be ſaved,</hi> we ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, we ſhall be protected. A good look from God is all good to man. God with a good look can ſave us; and if God withdraw his eye from any, and will not look upon them, if he turn his back upon them, or hide his face from them, his favour is withdrawn, and they are helpleſs. Now as God can ſave his people with a ſmiling look, ſo he can deſtroy his enemies with a frowning one. His look is as powerful and effectual to deſtroy, as it is to ſave; though to look ſavingly be much more the delight of God (if I may ſo ſpeak) than to look deſtroyingly. It is ſaid, God looked through the pillar of fire and the cloud, upon the Hoſts of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roah,</hi> and troubled them, and took off the chariot wheels (<hi>Exod.</hi> 14.24.) Surely God abaſeth the proud men of the world eaſily, when he doth it with a look. He indeed (as the holy Virgin ſpake in her ſong, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.51, 52.) <hi>Sheweth ſtrength with his arm (or the ſtrength of his arm) when he ſcattereth the proud in the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:48669:303"/> of their hearts, and puts down the mighty from their ſeats, and exalteth them of low degree;</hi> yet all this the Lord can do with a look from heaven, <hi>The habitation of his Holineſs, and of his Glory.</hi> Now,</p>
                  <p>If the Lord deal thus with proud men, take theſe inferences from it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Hath God ſuch an evil eye upon proud men, will he caſt them down? will he certainly do it? and can he eaſily do it? Then <hi>woe to proud men;</hi> 'tis the word of the Prophet (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.1.) <hi>Woe to the crown of pride, to the drunkards of Ephraim;</hi> that is, to thoſe who crown themſelves with pride, and make that their glory and their honour which will p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ove their ſhame and down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal: and theſe the Prophet calls <hi>the drunkards of Ephraim</hi> (I conceive) he means not thoſe that drink themſelves drunk with wine, but thoſe that are drunk with their own preſumptions, with the pride of their ſpirits, or, as many alſo are, with vain hopes and expectations. We have vain confidents and expectants ſo expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed (<hi>Nahum.</hi> 1.10.) <hi>While they are folded together as thorns, and while they are drunken as drunkards, they ſhall be devoured as ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fully dry;</hi> that is, while they are drunken with pride and ſelf-confidence to carry all before them, while they are thus fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded together like thorns, in their plots and contrivements, while they are drunken with falſe hopes, they ſhall be devoured as ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fully dry; that is, they ſhall be utterly conſumed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If there be ſuch a woe to proud ones, if the Lord hath ſuch a bad eye upon them, and is able to lay them low, and will certainly do it, and can eaſily do it, we had need conſider who are the proud ones. Pride is an evil weed, yet it groweth many times in the beſt ſoyl, even in a good heart; and it is no eaſie matter to find out who are the proud men intended in this Text and Point; yet I anſwer,</p>
                  <p>In general, Firſt, All they are proud who value themſelves very highly, yea, they are proud who put any undue value upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; we can ſcarcely value our ſelves any thing at all, but we ſhal over-value <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ur ſelves, <hi>for we are worms and no men,</hi> ſaith <hi>David:</hi> He ſaid alſo, <hi>What is man, O Lord, that thou art mindful of him?</hi> Man is ſo ſmall a thing, that the Pſalmiſt could hardly tell what he is, or what to make of him; ſure enough man is no ſuch thing
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:48669:303"/> as moſt men make of themſelves. Doubtleſs, if we have any high thoughts of our ſelves; we over-think our ſelves; and uſually they that have leaſt true worth, have greateſt thoughts of their own worthineſs. Man hath loſt all, is ſtript of all, as he cometh into the world, yet he is proud as if he had all. As they that have much are proud, or in great danger of pride, ſo it is a truth, that they who have nothing are often proud too. The Apoſtle bids <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi> (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.17.) <hi>Charge them that be rich in this world, that they be not high-minded.</hi> And among rich men, they who (as I may ſay, according to the phraſe of the world) have raiſed their own fortunes, are moſt apt to be proud; and there are two reaſons of it, Firſt, Becauſe of the change of their ſtate; they were low and empty, but now they are high and full. This change of their condition, changeth their diſpoſition; and (as we ſay) <hi>Their blood riſeth with their good.</hi> Secondly, That which they have is (ſay they) of their own getting; they think their skill and their dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence hath got it. Hence <hi>Job</hi> proteſted, <hi>If I rejoyced becauſe my hand hath gotten much. Nebuchadnezzar</hi> boaſted of his great Palace, becauſe he had built it; <hi>Is not this great</hi> Babel <hi>that I have built?</hi> Now, as they are apt to be proud who have much, eſpecially when it is of their own acquiſition (though indeed we have nothing meerly of our own acquiſition) ſo they who have lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or nothing, are not out of the danger of pride; <hi>poor &amp; proud</hi> is ſo common, that it is grown into a proverb. And they eſpecially, who are poor in ſpirituals, grow proud in ſpirit, as it was with the <hi>Laodicean</hi> Angel (<hi>Rev.</hi> 3.17.)</p>
                  <p>But further, they are proud who lift up themſelves in any thing of ſelf; As, Firſt, in their natural parts, wit, underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, memory, elocution; Secondly, in their acquired parts, learning, knowledge, skill; Thirdly, in their moral vertues, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety, temperance, juſtice; Fourthly, in their ſpiritual graces, faith, love, ſelf-denial ('tis poſſible to be proud for a fit of theſe, or to have a fit of pride come upon us upon the exerciſe of theſe) Fifthly, in their holy duties and performances, prayers, faſtings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Sixthly, in their legal righteouſneſs and good deeds, alms, charities. We ſeldom do well, or any good, eſpecially (as we ought, and duty binds us) much good, but we think too well of our ſelves (that we are better than we are) or too much both of the good we have done, and of our own goodneſs. As the
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:48669:304"/> great goodneſs of God, or the greatneſs of his goodneſs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears chiefly in this, that he can make all things, even evil things, and thoſe not only the evils of trouble, but the evil of ſin, work together for our good (<hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28.) ſo the great evil of mans heart, or the greatneſs of that evil, appears chiefly in this, that it cauſeth all things, even good things, and thoſe not only the good things of this natural life, but the good belonging to, and done in the power of a ſpiritual life, to work to our hurt, ſometimes for a time, and would to our ruine for ever, did not the Lord over-rule it. Seventhly, the favour which they have with men, whether they be <hi>the mighty,</hi> the Princes and powers of the world, or <hi>the many,</hi> the common people of the world. How are ſome lifted up, becauſe they are the darlings of the people, becauſe the multitude eyes them, points at them, and applauds them! To be lifted up in any of theſe things, or in any thing elſe (and what is there, not only of an earthly, but of an heavenly pedigree and extraction, in which the vain heart of man is not ready to be lifted up unduly, forgetting God from whom all good comes; to be lifted up, I ſay, in any of theſe things) layes man open to the wrathful reſiſtance of God, and all ſuch God will bring down and abaſe; therefore let us be empty of our ſelves, and beware of being found among the proud, yea, of being in any kind or degree proud. It is dangerous to have any pride found in us, but woe to thoſe who are found proud.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If the Lord hath ſuch an eye to, and upon proud men, and will thus bring them low, Then <hi>let us not be afraid of proud men;</hi> why ſhould we be afraid of them who are falling (<hi>Prov.</hi> 15.33.) <hi>The fear of the Lord is the inſtruction of wiſdom, and before honour is humility.</hi> But what ſaith the ſame <hi>Solomon (Prov.</hi> 18.32.) <hi>Before deſtruction the heart of man is haughty.</hi> As ſoon as ever we ſee any man ſhewing a proud heart by pride of life, we may quickly conclude the Lord is about to pluck him down. One very great reaſon why the Lord hath laid many, who were once as mountains, low as valleys, was the pride of their hearts. When pride buds, the rod bloſſometh; that is, God is preparing for the correction, if not for the deſtruction of proud ones. And as it is ſad to ſee <hi>pride bud</hi> at any time, ſo then eſpecially, when the <hi>rod bloſſometh,</hi> that is, when God is correcting us with his rods.</p>
                  <pb n="585" facs="tcp:48669:304"/>
                  <p>Fourthly, Then do not envy proud ones. We are apt to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy thoſe that are high in place, though they are proud in ſpirit; but, do not envy proud ones, how high, how great ſoever you ſee them, for they are in danger of falling, according to the truth of this Scripture, and many others. When proud men are in their fulleſt ruff, and higheſt aſcent, then they are neareſt a dreadful downfall; <hi>Before deſtruction the heart of man is haughty</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 18.12.) <hi>and before honour is humility.</hi> And the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> having given this counſel to thoſe who are humbled by affliction (1 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 5.6.) <hi>humble your ſelves under the mighty hand of God,</hi> ſubjoyns this comfortable promiſe in the cloſe of the verſe, <hi>That he may exalt you in due time.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Then <hi>pride is a very provoking ſin.</hi> The Lord who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares himſelf againſt all ſorts of ſinners, declares himſelf moſt againſt proud ſinners (<hi>Prov.</hi> 16.5.) <hi>Every one that is proud in heart, is an abomination to the Lord;</hi> &amp; mark what followeth in the ſame verſe, <hi>though hand joyn in hand, he</hi> (that is, the proud man) <hi>ſhall not be unpuniſhed.</hi> Pride is the Devils ſin, the Devil is that <hi>Myſtical Leviathan</hi> ſpoken of in the 41th Chapter of this Book, <hi>who is a King over all the children of pride.</hi> They who are not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to God (proud men above all men are not) are the Devils ſubjects; <hi>He is a King over all the children of pride.</hi> There are four things in which the provocation of the ſin of pride conſiſts, any one of which may provoke God to pull down proud ones.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Proud men ſet themſelves in the place of God, <hi>Lucifer</hi> (by whom the proud <hi>Babilonian</hi> is meant) ſaid (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 14.14.) <hi>I will be like the Moſt High.</hi> Thus the Lord ſaid of the Prince of <hi>Tyrus.</hi> (Ezek. 28.2.) <hi>Becauſe thine heart is lifted up, and thou haſt ſaid I am a God, I ſit in the ſeat of God, in the midſt of the ſeas; yet thou art a man and not God, though thou ſet thy heart as the heart of God.</hi> See how that proud Prince thought to carry it as God, as if he had been the founder of his own ſtrength. How can the Lord but be provoked with ſuch an affront as this? Proud <hi>Babilon</hi> ſpake this language, and at as high a rate (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 47.8.) <hi>I am, and none elſe beſides me</hi> (is not this to ſpeak juſt like God) <hi>I ſhall not ſit as a widdow, neither ſhall I know the loſs of children.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, As pride is an uſurpation of the place and power of God, ſo of the providences of God. A proud man knoweth not how to acknowledge God in any mercy, nor how to be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:48669:305"/> under the hand of God in any affliction. He mindes not God either in what he enjoyeth, or in what he ſuffereth; is not this a provocation?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Pride muſt needs provoke God, as a proud man ſets himſelf againſt all the Commands &amp; Laws of God. God cannot but be provoked, to ſee all his Laws and Commands ſlighted by man. A proud man will keep no bounds, nor would he be kept in any.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Pride is a Mother ſin, it brings forth many other ſins.

                  <p>Laſtly, If Pride provokes God, if he looketh upon every one that is proud, to abaſe him and bring him low; then how ſhould we labour to be <hi>humble ones,</hi> that the Lord may look upon us with a favourable eye, and ſo he doth upon all them that walk humbly with him. As <hi>God reſiſteth the proud, ſo he giveth grace to the humble,</hi> that is, favour. The humble ſhall have his favour, and the proud his frowns. As to <hi>do juſtly, and to love mercy,</hi> is the ſum of all duty to man; ſo to walk humbly, is the ſum of all duty to God (<hi>Mic.</hi> 6.8.) They who walk humbly, walk not onely holily, but ſafely. They who are low in their own eyes, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſpecial protection of the high God.</p>
                  <p>The Lord having called upon <hi>Job</hi> to ſhew the effect of his wrath againſt one ſort of bad men, <hi>the proud,</hi> calleth upon him in the next words, to ſhew the effects of his wrath upon all ſorts of bad men, comprehended under this general word, <hi>The wicked.</hi>

                  <p>The Lord bids <hi>Job</hi> do this if he could (indeed he could not) that he might ſhew himſelf a competent match for God. As if the Lord had ſaid, <hi>I tread down the wicked in their places, do thou

When <hi>David</hi> would ſhew how he (in caſe he were faulty) was willing to be made a very ſlave to his enemies, he phraſes it thus (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 7.5.) <hi>Let the enemy perſecute my ſoul and take it, yea, let him tread down my life upon the earth, and lay mine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in the duſt;</hi> that is, let him have full power over me, let me be at his mercy, though he be mercileſſe.

                     <q>The wicked.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The word <hi>wicked</hi> is often taken largely, ſo every man in a ſinful ſtate, may be called a <hi>wicked man;</hi> every perſon unconverted or unregenerate, every perſon that hath not true grace, is wicked.
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:48669:306"/> There is no middle eſtate among men, between good and bad, converted and unconverted; yet here the wicked are not to be taken onely in a large ſenſe, for ſinners in common, but ſtrictly,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, For the proud before ſpoken of, There the Lord ſaid, abaſe the proud, here he ſaith, <hi>Tread down the wicked;</hi> that is, the wicked who are proud. To be wicked and to be proud are the ſame: For as moſt wicked men are proud, ſo all proud men are wicked; for pride it ſelf is a great wickedneſſe: and it is pride that cauſeth moſt men to do wickedly, even to rebel againſt God and his righteous laws, to riſe up againſt his wayes and truths. When we have ſaid of a man he is proud, if we have not ſaid all evil, we have ſaid one of the worſt evils of him; and that which layes him open, as to ſuffer the worſt penal evils, ſo to do the worſt ſinful evils.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If we take the words diſtinctly (as we may) then by the wicked are meant groſſe and flagitious ſinners, notorious ſinners; for though, as I ſaid before, any one that hath not grace, may be called wicked, yet properly, and in Scripture ſenſe, wicked ones are notorious, preſumptuous, and flagitious ſinners, ſuch as ſin with a high hand, and with a ſtiffe neck.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, By the wicked we may eſpecially underſtand op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors, who are troubleſome and vexatious to others. As ſome are wicked in taking their own pleaſure, and in ſatisfying their vain deſires; ſo many are wicked in vexing, afflicting, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing others. The Hebrew word for a wicked man, ſignifies ſuch a one as is both unquiet himſelf, and will not ſuffer others to be quiet. In any of, or in all theſe three notions, we may expound the word wicked here; the wicked are proud ones, or notorious evil ones, or oppreſſors of others. <hi>Tread down the wicked</hi>
                     <q>In their place.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Hebrew is, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder them.</hi> The word alſo ſignifieth (as we render) a proper place; and that's conſiderable. <hi>Tread them down in their place.</hi> The Lord doth not ſay <hi>in thy place,</hi> but <hi>in their place;</hi> which may note theſe two things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Whereſoever thou findeſt them, tread them down.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>In their place,</hi> that is, where they flouriſh moſt, where they are beſt rooted, or moſt ſtrongly ſecured; where they have the greateſt advantages and ſtrengths to ſave them harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe.
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:48669:306"/> That is ſpecially <hi>a mans place,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Non eſt diffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le ſuperbum ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minem &amp; pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentem in alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no loco ſupera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, quia in eo minus habet potentiae. <hi>Sanct.</hi>
                     </note> where he ſeateth and hopes to ſettle himſelf. Now ſaith God, <hi>Tread them down in their place.</hi> I do ſo, I deſtroy the wicked, when and where they think themſelves ſafeſt, where they think no hand can touch them, nor arm reach them, there my foot ſhall tread them down. O <hi>Job,</hi> canſt thou do thus? or do thou thus, <hi>Tread down the wicked in their place.</hi> And as it followeth in the next verſe to the ſame effect.</p>

                        <hi>Verſe 13.</hi>
                     </bibl> Hide them in the duſt together, and bind their faces in ſecret.</q>
                  <p>That is, Bring them to utter deſtruction, to condign puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, even to death. Some expound <hi>hiding in the duſt,</hi> by laying in dungeons and filthy priſons. Secondly, Others ſay to hide in the duſt, notes death, or to lay them in their graves. <hi>Duſt thou art</hi> (ſaid God to <hi>Adam,</hi> Gen. 3.19.) <hi>and to duſt thou ſhalt return.</hi> That is, thou ſhalt die, and be put in thy grave; which poſſibly, is called, the duſt of death (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.15.) Hide them in the duſt of the earth, let them appear no more above ground to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thee or others. <hi>Hide them in the duſt</hi>
                     <q>Together.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>That is either,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>All at a time.</hi> Thus the Lord can do, he can deſtroy all the wicked at once, at one time, in one hour. Or,</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Together;</hi> that is, in one place. God can gather the wicked all together, and ſo make an end of them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, both as to time and place.</p>
                  <p>Yet I conceive neither of theſe are here intended; for God doth not uſually deſtroy the wicked all at one time, nor all in one place; he hath ſeveral times and ſtages to act his providences in and upon, ſo that, to hide them in the duſt <hi>together,</hi> is but this, to hide them <hi>alike,</hi> to put them all into the ſame condition, at one time or other, in one place or other, that they may be able to do no more miſchief.</p>
                  <q>And bind their faces in ſecret.</q>
                  <p>That's the laſt expreſſion, ſhewing what God doth, and what he bid <hi>Job</hi> do, <hi>Bind their faces in ſecret.</hi> There may be a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold interpretation of theſe words; either,</p>
                  <pb n="590" facs="tcp:48669:307"/>
                  <p>Firſt, In alluſion to men condemned, whoſe faces uſe to be covered; a Sentence of death being pronounced and paſſed upon them, they were as it were hid from the light of the living. Thus as ſoon as <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> the King had paſſed ſentence againſt <hi>Haman, they covered his face (Eſth.</hi> 7.8.) or</p>
                  <p>Secondly, This covering their faces, may be an alluſion to actually dead men, whoſe faces if they die among men, eſpecially among friends, are alwayes bound up and decently covered. When Chriſt called <hi>Lazarus</hi> out of the grave, the Text ſaith (<hi>John</hi> 11.44.) <hi>He came forth, his face being bound about with a napkin.</hi> So then, to bind their faces in ſecret, is as if it had been ſaid, bring them to death, or put them to death. Thus the Lord calls <hi>Job</hi> to that in three particulars, which himſelf will certainly do.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To <hi>Tread down the wicked.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, To <hi>Hide them in the dust together.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, To <hi>Bind their faces in ſecret.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Notes which I ſhall give from theſe words, will be ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon that three-fold interpretation of the word <hi>wicked.</hi> And</p>
                  <p>Firſt, As the wicked are taken for the ſame with the proud in the former verſe.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve;
<q>Proud men are wicked men.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Behold</hi> (ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.1.) <hi>The day of the Lord ſhall burn as an oven, and all the proud, and all that do wickedly, ſhall be ſtubble.</hi> The proud, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>d they that do wickedly go together. The proud do wickedly, and are therefore deſervedly numbred among the wicked. Pride is the firſt of thoſe ſeven things which are an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to the Lord (<hi>Prov.</hi> 6.16, 17.) <hi>There are ſix things that the Lord hates, yea, ſeven are abomination to him. A proud look,</hi> that's firſt; and if <hi>a proud look,</hi> then certainly a <hi>proud heart,</hi> and a proud ſpirit. Proud perſons have not onely a chief, but the firſt place by name among thoſe whom the Lord abominates. And in that black Catalogue of eighteen ſorts of wicked ones, that ſhall trouble the world in the latter dayes, the proud are not the laſt nor the leaſt; (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.2, 3, 4, 5.) <hi>In the last dayes perilous times ſhall come,</hi> why? what ſhall make them ſo? The reaſon follows, <hi>For men ſhall be lovers of their own ſelves, covetous, boaſters, proud.</hi> Now though the proud man comes in the fourth place, by name, yet he is
<pb n="591" facs="tcp:48669:307"/> in the firſt place as to influence; for what is the reaſon why men over-love themſelves? is it not becauſe they are proud, and have too high thoughts of themſelves? <hi>David (Pſal.</hi> 119.21.) ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the wickedneſs of proud men, or that proud men are extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wicked, while he ſaith to and of God, <hi>Thou haſt rebuked the proud that are curſed, which do erre from thy Commandements.</hi> The proud are ſuch as continually wander out of the wayes of truth and holineſſe. Pride will not let us keep Commandements ('tis the humble ſoul which keeps them) and therefore pride may be called the breach of all the Commandements; and if ſo, proud men muſt needs be the very firſt-born of the wicked; and therefore <hi>David</hi> ſaith of them, that they are not onely under the rebuke of God, but under his curſe, which is the peculiar portion and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of the wicked. And what the way of proud men is, both in doing and ſpeaking, the ſame <hi>David</hi> tells us (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 75.45.) <hi>I ſaid unto the fools, deal not fooliſhly; and to the wicked, lift not up the horn, lift not up your horn on high, ſpeak not with a ſtiffe neck,</hi> that is, be not proud. Wicked men lift up their horn and tongue, they cannot but ſhew their pride in word and deed. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil is <hi>the wicked one</hi> (Matth. 13.19.) The high-way ground ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received the ſeed, 'tis ſaid, <hi>the wicked one</hi> (that is, the Devil) <hi>cometh and catcheth it away.</hi> And when the world <hi>is ſaid to lie in wickedneſs, or in the wicked one</hi> (1 <hi>John</hi> 5.19.) The meaning is, the Devil over-rules the carnal world. Now, as the Devil is <hi>the wicked one,</hi> ſo he is <hi>the proud one alſo.</hi> Pride was that wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs for which God trod him down, and his wickedneſs ſtill continueth in tempting men to, or in puffing them up with pride. It is the buſineſſe of <hi>the wicked one,</hi> the Devil, to make men proud, becauſe he knows pride will make them wicked, and do wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Pride hardeneth the mind (as <hi>Daniel</hi> ſaith it did <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezar, Chap.</hi> 5.20.) Now what wickedneſſe is there, which a hardened mind will not attempt to do! Pride put <hi>Herod</hi> upon ſeeking the bloud of Chriſt, who came to ſave and waſh ſinners with his blood.</p>
                  <p>Proud men are very wicked as they deſpiſe other men (a proud man thinks no man ſo good as himſelf, or himſelf too good for all other men) Some proud men are ſo wicked, that they deſpiſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven God himſelf. The proud man lifts up himſelf againſt the <hi>Word of God,</hi> ſlights the promiſes, regards not the threatnings of
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:48669:308"/> God; his heart is lifted up againſt the Commandements of God, nor doth he value the comforts of God; he neglects the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God, nor doth he reverence the Providences of God. He that doth, or is ready to do all this, is ſurely a deſpiſer of God himſelf. How wicked a man is he, whoſe heart is lifted up both againſt God and man!</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Conſider the wicked proud man, as one whom God treadeth down.</p>
                  <p>Then, Obſerve;
<q>God puniſheth ſinners with that which is moſt croſſe to their luſts.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>What more croſſe to a high-ſpirited man, than to be brought low; and who can be brought lower than he that is trodden down. As God ſometimes puniſheth Drunkards with thirſt, and Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons with hunger, and covetous perſons with poverty. <hi>There is one</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 11.29.) <hi>that with-holdeth more than is meet</hi> (he doubtleſs is a covetous man that doth ſo) <hi>&amp; it tendeth to poverty.</hi> So God puniſheth proud ones, by that which is moſt contrary to their nature, he abaſeth and layeth them low. The Prophet tells us (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 3.16, 17.) how the Lord would puniſh wanton women, who were proud either of their natural beauty, or artificial dreſſes and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. <hi>The daughters of Zion</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>are haughty, and walk with ſtretched forth necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they go, and making a tinckling with their feet;</hi> there's their pride: but what was their puniſhment? the next words reſolve us. <hi>Therefore the Lord will ſmite with a ſcab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and the Lord will diſcover their ſecret parts;</hi> they were proud of that which covered their skin, and therefore the Lord puniſht them with ſcabs, or covered their skin with ſcurfe and ſcabs; and as there the Lord ſhews what he would bring upon, ſo what he would take from them. (Verſ. 18.) <hi>In that day the Lord will take away the bravery of their tinckling ornaments about their feet, and their Caules, and their round tyres like the Moon. And</hi> (Verſ. 24.) <hi>it ſhall come to paſs that inſtead of ſweet ſmell there ſhall be ſtink, and inſtead of a girdle a rent, and inſtead of well ſet hair baldneſs, and inſtead of a ſtomacher a girding of ſackcloth, and burning inſtead of beauty.</hi> What could be more contrary to the pride of theſe women, than that which the Lord brought upon
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:48669:308"/> them, or puniſhed them with. What do proud women more deſire than beauty and bravery? And what do proud men look after, but to be reſpected, honoured, and to have every one point the finger at them, or bow the knee to them? Now when the Lord blaſts proud women in their beauty and bravery, when he blaſts proud men in their honour and eſtimation, when he thus abaſeth and treads them down, he toucheth them in that which the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of pride prizeth moſt, and with greateſt regret parteth from. Pride is a baſe height of ſpirit, therefore the Lord abaſeth the proud. There are five words in the Text, all tending directly to croſſe the ſpirit of a proud man.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, He <hi>ſhall be abaſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, He ſhall <hi>be brought low.</hi> A proud man would fain be high, he would ſit at the upper end of the Table, yea, he would ſit at the upper end of the World too; but, ſaith the Lord, he ſhall be brought low.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, What would a proud man do? He would tread up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the necks of all others, but he ſhall be trodden under foot.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Where would the proud man be? He would be conſpicuous in high places, but he ſhall be hid in the duſt.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, He would be lookt at by all men with admiration, but, ſaith God, his face ſhall be bound in ſecret; he loves to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear and make a fair ſhew in the fleſh, but he ſhall not appear at all.. Proud ones cannot get ſo high, but God in his Juſtice will get above them, and ſtrip them of that wherein they have chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prided themſelves. Read (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 14.11, 12, 13, 14, 24, 25. and <hi>Iſa.</hi> 23.9.) Thoſe Scriptures tell us how the Lord deals with proud men, according to their pride, or rather contrary to their pride; he gives them that which they moſt diſguſt, and takes that from them which they moſt paſſionately deſire.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Take wicked men in the common notion, for thoſe that do evil at the higheſt rate, that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and ſin as it were with cart-ropes. Then,</p>
                  <p>Obſerve, Firſt;
<q>Wicked men, that is, impenitent ſinners, high-handed ſinners, are in a very ſad condition, and ſhall come to a ſad conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Lord will tread them down (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.16, 17.) <hi>The wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:48669:309"/> is ſnared in the work of his own hands, yea, the wicked ſhall be turned into hell.</hi> That is, the utmoſt of ſorrow and ſuffering ſhall be their portion (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 3.11.) <hi>Wo to the wicked, for the reward of their doings ſhall be given them.</hi> (Iſa. 57.21.) <hi>There is no peace, ſaith my God, to the wicked.</hi> As the tumultuouſneſs of their own ſpirits will not let them be at peace, ſo neither will the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, From thoſe expreſſions, <hi>Tread down the wicked in their place, hide them in the duſt together, bind their faces in ſecret.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Obſerve;
<q>God will at laſt purge and rid the world of wicked men.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>As wicked men would fain purge and rid the world of godly men, they would deſtroy all the ſeed of the righteous; ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly God will deſtroy the wicked of the world, and rid the world of them, though not at once of every wicked man, yet in their times and ſeaſons, that they ſhall not do the miſchief which their hearts are full of. The laſt of the Prophets ſpeaks as much of the Lords vengeance upon all the wicked (<hi>Mal.</hi> 4.1.) <hi>The day of the Lord.</hi> (ſpeaking of ſome great day of the Lords appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance) <hi>ſhall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, ſhall be ſtubble; and the day that cometh ſhall burn them up, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, that it ſhall leave them neither root nor branch.</hi> 'Tis utter ruin to be deſtroyed <hi>root and branch;</hi> ſuch ſhall the ruin of the wicked be. Thus alſo the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> comforts the Church (<hi>Chap.</hi> 52.1.) <hi>Awake, awake, put on thy ſtrength, O Zion; put on thy beautiful garments, O Jeruſalem, the holy City; for henceforth there ſhall no more come into thee, the uncircumciſed and the unclean.</hi> The wicked of the world are the uncircumciſed, they have not the ſpiritual circumciſion, the circumciſion of the heart; theſe ſhall no more trouble <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> nor tread in <hi>Zions</hi> Courts. (<hi>Nahum.</hi> 1.15.) <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publiſheth peace; O Judah keep thy ſolemn feaſts, perform thy Vows, for the wicked ſhall no more paſſe through thee, he is utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cut off.</hi> The Hebrew is, <hi>Belial ſhall no more paſſe through thee:</hi> That is, ſuch as caſt off the yoke of Jeſus Chriſt, ſhall no more bring <hi>Judah</hi> under their yoke. This is alſo witneſſed by another
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:48669:309"/> holy Prophet (<hi>Zech.</hi> 14.21.) <hi>In that day there ſhall be no more the</hi> Cananite <hi>in the houſe of the Lord of hoſts,</hi> they ſhall no more mingle themſelves with the faithful ſervants of God, much leſs rule over them. <hi>Canaanites</hi> have often been in the houſe of the Lord, but the <hi>Canaanite</hi> ſhall not always be there; God will ſweep them out of his houſe. Anſwerable to theſe propheſies ſpeaks the laſt propheſie (<hi>Rev.</hi> 21.27. <hi>Chap.</hi> 22.15.) which ſome interpret of a glorious ſtate of the Church here, and 'tis undoubtedly true (as all agree) of the Church in glory: <hi>No unclean thing ſhall enter; without ſhall be dogs.</hi> Then indeed, God will <hi>abaſe the proud, and tread down the wicked,</hi>
                     <q>In their place.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note, Thirdly;
<q>No outward advantages (and except thoſe they have none) ſhall ſtand the wicked in ſtead, or keep them from falling.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>God will tread them down in <hi>their place;</hi> when they are where they would be, upon their own ground, they ſhall be worſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The Scripture ſpeaks often of treading down the wicked, notwithſtanding their greateſt advantages. Union is a great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage for preſervation, yet (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.9.) <hi>Aſſociate your ſelves, O ye people and ye ſhall be broken in pieces; and give ear all ye far Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, gird your ſelves, and you ſhall be broken in pieces; take counſel together, and it ſhall come to nought, ſpeak the word, and it ſhall not ſtand.</hi> As if the Lord had ſad, <hi>I will not take you at an advantage, before you are gathered together, before you are girded; I will not ſurprize you unarmed and unprovided; do your beſt to ſave and ſecure your ſelves from my vengeance,</hi> aſſociate your ſelves, gird your ſelves, take counſel together, and then I will tread you down. Neither ſtrongeſt aſſociations, nor wiſeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultations, nor higheſt reſolutions, nor compleateſt preparations for action (though ye have <hi>ſpoken the word and are girt</hi>) ſhall avail you in the day of my wrath. Thus the Lord beſpake <hi>Jehoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>akim</hi> by his Prophet (<hi>Jerem.</hi> 22.15.) <hi>Shalt thou reign becauſe thou cloſeſt thy ſelf in Cedar?</hi> As if he had ſaid, becauſe thou doſt make ſuch proviſion for thy own ſafety, doſt thou think to be be ſafe? or canſt thou ſhelter thy ſelf againſt me? Again (verſ. 23.) <hi>O Inhabitant of</hi> Lebanon, <hi>that makeſt thy neſt in the Cedars</hi> (Cedars are high trees and ſtrong) <hi>how gracious ſhalt
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:48669:310"/> thou be when pangs come upon thee, the pain of a woman in travel.</hi> The Lord puts a ſcorn upon them, ſuch a kind of ſcorn (but not as hers, without cauſe) as <hi>Michal</hi> put upon <hi>David</hi> (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.20.) <hi>how glorious was the King of</hi> Iſrael <hi>to day.</hi> Were not you very glorious when you danced uncovered before the ark? Thus, I ſay, the Lord puts a holy ſcorn upon the wicked, when they are in their Cedar-neſts; <hi>How gracious wilt thou be,</hi> when pangs of ſorrow come upon thee. Take one Scripture more (<hi>Jerem.</hi> 49.16.) <hi>Thy terribleneſs</hi> ('tis ſpoken of <hi>Edom) hath deceived thee,</hi> (thou thoughteſt thy ſelf ſo terrible that none durſt touch thee, yet, <hi>thy terribleneſs hath deceived thee) and the pride of thy heart, O thou that dwelleſt in the clefts of the rock, and holdeſt the height of the hill; though thou ſhouldſt make thy neſt as high as the Eagles, I will bring thee down from thence, ſaith the Lord.</hi> Thou haſt all the advantages, thou haſt a rock for ſtrength, and thou art upon a hill for height, yea, upon the height of the hill, thou art above all; but though thy neſt were as the Eagles, <hi>I will pluck thee thence.</hi> Thus the Lord treads down the wicked in their place, in there fortifications, in their mounts and towers; when they have ſecured themſelves moſt by counſels, and friends, and ſtrong-holds, then and there he treads them down, even <hi>in their place.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Note;
<q>God is known to be God, or ſheweth himſelf to be God by abaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the proud, and by treading down wicked men.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ground it thus. The Lord would have <hi>Job</hi> ſhew himſelf like God, or act as God doth, by treading down the wicked. God made himſelf known to be God, by the Plagues which he brought upon <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> as well as by the deliverance and ſalvation which he wrought for <hi>Iſrael (Exod.</hi> 8.22. <hi>Exod.</hi> 9.14.) <hi>I will ſend all my plagues upon thy heart, and upon thy ſervants, and upon thy people, that thou mayſt know that there is none like me in very deed for this cauſe have I raiſed thee up, for to ſhew in thee my power, and that my name may be declared throghout all the earth.</hi> Thus alſo ſaid <hi>David (Pſal.</hi> 9.16.) <hi>The Lord is known by the judgment that he executeth,</hi> that is, by puniſhing the wicked he is known to be the Lord. God is known by his works, as well as in his word: power and greatneſs, and wiſdom and juſtice are viſible in his judgments.</p>
                  <pb n="597" facs="tcp:48669:310"/>
                  <p>There was a third ſort of <hi>wicked</hi> men named in opening the Text, which I ſhall but touch in this obſervation. Such they were deſcribed to be as are unquiet themſelves, nor will they ſuffer others to be quiet by their good wills; they are troubled that any live peaceably by them: The Lord will tread down theſe unquiet wicked ones alſo. The Scripture is full of this truth (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.1.) <hi>Wo to thee that ſpoileſt, and thou waſt not ſpoiled; and dealeſt treacherouſly, and they dealt not treacherouſly with thee: when thou ſhalt ceaſe to ſpoil, thou ſhalt be ſpoiled; and when thou ſhalt make an end to deal treacherouſly, they ſhall deal treacherouſly with thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the Lord having put <hi>Job</hi> to all theſe trials of his ſtrength (thereby to ſhew himſelf able to contend with him) tells him plainly, if thou canſt do theſe things,<note place="margin">Vexatio verba minus limata extorſit, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia &amp; caſta permanſit.</note> if thou canſt abaſe the proud, if thou canſt tread them down, hide them in the duſt, and bind their faces in ſecret, <hi>Then</hi>
                     <q>
                        <p>
                           <bibl>
                              <hi>Verſ. 14.</hi>
                           </bibl> Will I confeſs that thine own right hand can ſave thee.</p>
                        <p>Then will I confeſs.</p>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>That is, when thou haſt done all theſe things,<note place="margin">Confeſſio pro laude &amp; hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifico teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio ſaepe poni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur in Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra.

                     </note> I will give an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable teſtimony of thee, I will not hide thy power; and then I will acknowledge, thou haſt ſome colour to conteſt with me, and art able to uphold thy ſelf. Theſe mighty acts are proper and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to me; yet thou ſeemeſt to ſay, thou canſt do all theſe, elſe, ſurely thou hadſt never offered to contend with me. That's the ſcope of theſe words, <hi>Then will I confeſs</hi>
                     <q>That thine own right hand can ſave thee.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Or that thou canſt be a <hi>ſelf-ſaviour,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hoc ſolius Dei eſt qui quod eſt, per ſe eſt, &amp; à quo omnis poteſtas &amp; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnitas.</note> or that thou art <hi>ſelf-ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,</hi> as I am, and haſt no dependance upon any; and then thou needeſt not complain that I do not help thee, for thou canſt help thy ſelf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thine own right hand can ſave thee.</hi> The hand is an inſtrument of help, eſpecially the <hi>right hand;</hi> and then the right hand ſaves, when it either keeps us from danger, or delivers us out of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> But did <hi>Job</hi> ever ſay his own right hand could ſave him.</p>
                  <pb n="598" facs="tcp:48669:311" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw. Job</hi> never ſaid it, nor thought it, his mind was pure from ſuch blaſphemy; yet he ſometimes ſpake as if he had been ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more than a man, eſpecially, when he ſpake of debating his matters and arguing with God.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, In that the Lord ſaith, in caſe <hi>Job</hi> could do all thoſe things, he would confeſs <hi>that his own right hand could ſave him,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note;
<q>He that can deſtroy all others, can ſave himſelf.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Illa facere poſſe, &amp; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ipſum ſalvare unius, &amp; ejuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem ſunt vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutis.</note>There goes no more to ſave our ſelves out of any trouble, than to deſtroy all others. The Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſaith (<hi>Chap.</hi> 4.12.) <hi>There is one law-giver, who is able to ſave and deſtroy.</hi> God is this law-giver, he is able to do both; and becauſe he can deſtroy all, he can ſave all, and will ſave all that truſt in him. The devil is called a <hi>deſtroyer,</hi> he is called <hi>Abaddon</hi> in Hebrew, and <hi>Apollyon</hi> in Greek, that is, a <hi>deſtroyer (Rev.</hi> 9.11.) but he cannot deſtroy all; if he could, he would ſoon make ſad work, none ſhould be ſaved. There is but one law-giver, who can ſave and deſtroy, take away life and give life; he can do the one as well as the other, and both as often as he will. The Lord hath an abſolutely ſupream power over men, and may diſpoſe of them for life or death as he pleaſeth; even, eternal life and death, ſalvation and damnation are in his hand; 'tis therefore <hi>a fearful thing to fall into the hand</hi> (the revenging hand) <hi>of the living God (Heb.</hi> 10.31.) upon the neglect, much more upon the deſpiſing and contempt of the covenant of life and peace by Jeſus Chriſt, as 'tis ſaid at the 29th <hi>verſe</hi> of that <hi>Chapter.</hi> Chriſt is the beſt friend and the worſt enemy; <hi>To him belong the iſſues from death (Pſal.</hi> 68.20.) and <hi>he hath the keyes af death and hell (Rev.</hi> 1.18.) Let us rejoyce with trembling before him, <hi>who is able to ſave and deſtroy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Note;
<q>Man cannot ſave himſelf by the beſt of his power.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>No, not by his own right hand. Man cannot ſave himſelf, Firſt, from temporal evils; he cannot ſave himſelf from ſickneſs nor from poverty, he cannot ſave himſelf from any danger that is ready to fall upon him; nor can the ſtrongeſt creatures ſave him (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.17.) <hi>A horſe is a vain thing to ſave a man,</hi> and man is as vain a thing to ſave himſelf; a horſe cannot deliver us by
<pb n="599" facs="tcp:48669:311"/> his great ſtrength, or by the greatneſs of his skill and wiſdom. Secondly, much leſs can man ſave himſelf from ſpiritual and eternal evils. While we conſider, Firſt, out of what miſery we are ſaved. Secondly, from what mighty enemies we are ſaved. Thirdly, from whoſe wrath we are ſaved. Fourthly, what price was required, that we might be ſaved. Fifthly, what mercy and grace were needful to ſave us: we muſt needs confeſs, that our right hand cannot ſave us, ſpiritually and eternally. Who can ſave himſelf out of the hand of that great enemy the devil, and his legions of darkneſs? who can ſave himſelf from that gulf of miſery, into which ſin hath plunged us? who can deliver him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from the curſe of the Law, or from ſin, the ſting of death? who can deliver himſelf from the power of his luſts, from the pride, unbelief, covetouſneſs and hardneſs of his own heart? Our own right hand cannot ſave us from any of theſe evils. The devil and the world are too ſtrong for us, and ſo is every luſt and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our own evil hearts. Can we by any power of our own convert our ſelves, or preſerve our ſelves after converſion? Can we get out of the Kingdom of darkneſs by our own power? or put our ſelves into the Kingdom of light by our own po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>er? That we are either temporally, or ſpiritually, or eternally ſaved, is all from the power, from the right hand of God, not at all from our own. Unleſs we give all to God, we take all from him. <hi>He that is our God, is the God of ſalvation, and unto God the Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the iſſues from death (Pſal.</hi> 68.20.) Salvation of every kind, and the iſſues from every kind of death, are of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Note;
<q>God can ſave alone, or by his own right hand.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>That the Lord would have <hi>Job</hi> underſtand; and this we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand from other Scriptures (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.7.) <hi>Shew thy marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous loving kindneſs, O thou that ſaveſt by thy right hand thoſe that put their truſt in thee.</hi> This is one of Gods royal Titles, <hi>Thou that ſaveſt by thy right hand (Pſal.</hi> 98.1.) <hi>O ſing unto the Lord a new ſong, for he hath done marvellous things, his right hand and his holy arm hath gotten him the victory</hi> (Pſal. 44.4.) <hi>Thou art my King of old, commanding deliverances for Jacob.</hi> How eaſily can the Lord ſave with his hand, who can ſave with his tongue, and deliver by commanding deliverances? Nor is it one deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
<pb n="600" facs="tcp:48669:312"/> only which the Lord commands, but many, yea, any: That Pſalm gives it plurally, <hi>commanding deliverances.</hi> The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſpeaks of this ſole and ſolitary ſaving power of God (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.16.) <hi>He ſaw that there was no man</hi> (that is, no man that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered any help) <hi>and wondred that there was no interceſſor</hi> (that is, no man to ſpeak a good word for them) <hi>therefore his arm brought ſalvation to him, and his righteouſneſs it ſuſtained him.</hi> And again (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.5.) <hi>I looked, and there was none to help, and I wondred that there was none to uphold; therefore mine own arm brought ſalvation to me.</hi> This is it which was ſaid before (<hi>verſ.</hi> 3.) <hi>I have trodden the wine-preſs alone, and of the people there was none with me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence we may infer;
<q>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> If the Lords right hand can ſave alone, Then there can never be too few hands for God to ſave us by.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>There may be ſometimes too many for God to ſave us by, but never too few. Why? becauſe he can ſave by his own right hand. The Lord ſaid to <hi>Gideon (Judg.</hi> 7.2.) <hi>The people that are with thee, are too many for me to give the</hi> Midianites <hi>into their hands</hi> (they were ſo many, that the ſole ſalvation of God would not appear) <hi>leſt</hi> Iſrael <hi>vaunt themſelves againſt me, ſaying, mine own hand hath ſaved me.</hi> Though we have but little ſtrength, yet it may be too much for Gods purpoſe, we being apt to boaſt our ſelves, when we have any hands to ſave us, as if our own right hand had ſaved us.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> If God can ſave by his own right hand, Then, when we ſee none, when we ſee nothing to ſave us by, let us truſt God alone.</q>
                  <p>If God be with us, we have ſtrength enough, and hands enough with us. It is all one with the Lord, to ſave by few or by many, yea, by few or by none at all, for his own right hand can do it.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Then truſt in Gods right hand alone for ſalvation, how many hands ſoever you have at any time at work for your ſalvation.</q>
                  <p>This is our ſin, that when we have many hands to ſave us, we truſt in them, rather than in the right hand of God. The Lord
<pb n="601" facs="tcp:48669:312"/> often and uſually makes uſe of mans hand to ſave us by <hi>(Obad. ver. ult.) And Saviours ſhall come upon mount</hi> Zion <hi>to judge the mount of</hi> Eſau, <hi>and the Kingdom ſhall be the Lords.</hi> Now, though the Lord uſeth other right hands to ſave us by, and to judge the wicked by, beſides his own, yet we muſt truſt in his alone; for 'tis he alone that ſaveth us, by what hand ſoever our ſalvation is wrought or brought to us.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Obſerve;
<q>To ſave by a ſelf-power, is the ſole prerogative of God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Only he who ſtands upon his own bottom, or ſubſiſts in and of himſelf alone, can ſave or do any thing of himſelf alone. And as none can do any thing alone, or by a ſelf-power, but God; ſo none ſhould preſume that they can do, or undertake to do the leaſt thing alone. We may, yea, we muſt uſe our hands; that is,<note place="margin">Divinitatis gloriam ſibi arrogant, &amp; (quaſi) Deum agere volunt.</note> do our endeavour for the accompliſhment of every work (for God doth not work ſo as to let man ſtand ſtill and be idle) but we muſt not ſo much as have a thought, that we can effect any thing by our hands. That wiſe woman <hi>Abigail</hi> intimated to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.31.) that, if he had gone on to avenge himſelf upon <hi>Nabal</hi> with his own hand, it might have proved grief to him, and offence of heart, that is, trouble of conſcience. Now, as we muſt not at all uſe our own hand in avenging our ſelves, nor think of avenging our ſelves by our own right hand (for ſaith God, <hi>Vengeance is mine, and I will repay it</hi>) ſo it is exceeding ſinful to imagine that we can ſave our ſelves, or do any thing, effectually, towards it by our own hand. I may ſay theſe four things, to ſhew the ſinfulneſs of ſuch an imagination.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It is high preſumption to think ſo. It was the preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the great <hi>Aſſyrian (Iſa.</hi> 10.13.) to ſay, <hi>By the ſtrength of my hand have I done it, and by my wiſdom, for I am prudent; and I have removed the bounds of the people</hi> (he had no mind to remove their bonds) <hi>and have robbed their treaſures, and I have put down the inhabitants like a valiant man.</hi> So we render the ſimilitude, <hi>Like a valiant man,</hi> and ſo do moſt interpreters;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Arnold. Boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> Animad. ſacr. in vetus teſt. lib. <hi>3.</hi> cap. <hi>2.</hi>
                     </note> both ancient and modern; yet a late learned critick diſſenting from them all, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, I have knockt them down, or ſlain them, <hi>like a beaſt or bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock for ſlaughter or ſacrifice.</hi> Which expoſition he confirms, as by the ſenſe of the word there uſed, ſo by the cuſtom of ſpeaking
<pb n="602" facs="tcp:48669:313"/> in all languages, it being uſual to compare great ſlaughters of men to the ſlaughtering of beaſts; but of this by the way. Now, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we take our reading or this, either of them ſets out the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous boaſting of the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> King, that the ſtrength of his own right hand had done all thoſe great things.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, 'Tis fleſhly confidence, ſuch a confidence as God will reject (<hi>Jer.</hi> 2.37.) to think we can do any thing by our own hand.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It is a ſlighting of, and departing from God to think ſo (<hi>Jer.</hi> 17.5.) <hi>Curſed be the man that truſteth in man, and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth fleſh his arm</hi> (whether his own fleſh or other mens fleſh, what fleſh ſoever it is that he maketh his arm, curſed be he, and what follows) <hi>and whoſe heart departeth from the Lord.</hi> As if he had ſaid, every time we think to ſave our ſelves by our own right hand, we do curſedly depart from the Lord. The truth is, we can no more ſave our ſelves, than we can make our ſelves; we can no more preſerve our being, than we can give our ſelves a being; it is from the Lord that we have a being, or are preſerved from a miſerable being.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, They who think they can ſave themſelves by their own hand, put themſelves into the place of God, and take upon themſelves to be God. The King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſaid well (2 <hi>King.</hi> 5.7.) when the King of <hi>Syria</hi> ſent <hi>Naaman</hi> his ſervant to heal him of his Leproſie, <hi>Am I God; to kill and to make alive, that this man doth ſend to me to recover a man of his Leproſie?</hi> Whoſoever thinks he can heal, or ſave by his own power, takes upon himſelf, as if he were God.<note place="margin">Faciunt vim ſuam, Deum ſuum.</note> 
                     <hi>Many make their force their God.</hi> That Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then King (<hi>Hab.</hi> 1.11.) aſcribed <hi>his power to his god.</hi> So we render the words; yet ſome expound them, as if <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar,</hi> in the pride of his heart, refuſing at that time to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge any God but himſelf, aſcribed his power to himſelf. But ſuppoſing according to the ſupplement of our tranſlation, and the expoſition of many more, that he aſcribed his power not to himſelf, but to his Idol-god; how great a rebuke will that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of his be to any, who worſhipping the true God, ſhall yet aſcribe their power to themſelves, and ſo take upon themſelves to be God? <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid to <hi>Rachel,</hi> when ſhe was ſo impatient for children, <hi>Am I in the place of God?</hi> To give effect, is the work of God; and therefore, for us to think we can give
<pb n="603" facs="tcp:48669:313"/> effect to what we do, is to take upon us to be God. The King of <hi>Tyrus</hi> is therefore ſaid, <hi>To ſet his heart as the heart of God (Ezek.</hi> 28.6.) becauſe he thought he could defend and ſecure himſelf by a ſelf-power and ſtrength, or by a ſelf-wiſdom and policy. Let us renounce our own arm, and power, and ſtrength, and right hand, in all things; let us look upon our own right hand as weak and withered, unable to bring any thing to paſs, but as the Lord ſhall be pleaſed to put forth his right hand to ſtrengthen ours. And when we are thus ſenſible of our own weakneſs, as alſo humbled under a ſenſe of it, then the Lord gives out moſt ſtrength to us; yea, makes us able to do all things (which are our duty, and we have a call to do) <hi>through Chriſt ſtrengthning us (Phil.</hi> 4.13.) And as we ſhall find Chriſt ſtrengthning us to do, ſo to ſuffer all things when we are weak in our ſelves. The Apoſtles experience taught him to ſay ſo (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.10.) <hi>I take pleaſure in infirmities, in reproaches, in neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, in perſecutions, in diſtreſſes for Chriſts ſake; for where I am weak</hi> (that is, in my ſelf) <hi>there I am ſtrong;</hi> that is, in the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Lord hath been dealing with <hi>Job</hi> to humble him, by putting him upon thoſe things which he himſelf alone can do; by which he taught <hi>Job,</hi> and teacheth us and all men, that no man can ſave himſelf by his own right hand. There is no ſalvation in any name, in any hand, but in Jeſus Chriſts; much leſs ſpiritual or eternal ſalvation.</p>

                  <p>THe Lord having ſpoken (in the former context) concerning proud men, whom he alone is able to abaſe, to lay low, to tread down, as 'tis there expreſt; he preſently ſubjoyns, not only the mention, but a very large and accurate deſcription of two huge vaſt and (as to bigneſs) monſtrous creatures; the one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Land, the other to the water.

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus the Lord who had exemplified his power and wiſdom to <hi>Job</hi> in divers creatures of a leſſer ſize and port, now gives inſtance in two of the greateſt, the Elephant and Leviathan, which may well be called <hi>The chief patterns or pieces of divine power and skill,</hi> that ſo, <hi>Job</hi> might be further convinced, and more deeply humbled by theſe viſible things, of the inviſible power of God, or might learn how mighty that God is that made them, how mighty that God is who rules and over-rules them. The one would trouble all at Land, and the other all at Sea, if God did not binde and bridle them. This doubtleſs, or ſomewhat like this, is the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſcope of the Lords long diſcourſe about theſe two famous crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, even to ſhew how much man is below God, ſeeing he is ſo much (in many things) below theſe beaſts; or, that man who in many things is no match for theſe creatures, cannot poſſibly be a match for God, who made them.

We ſhould not paſs the leaſt work of God lightly by, much leſs ſhould we ſo paſs by the great works of God.

                  <p>The word <hi>Behemoth</hi> is applicable to, or may ſignifie any greater or great beaſt of the field (<hi>Gen.</hi> 3.14.) <hi>The Lord ſaid unto the ſerpent; becauſe thou haſt done this, thou art curſed above all cattle,</hi>

                     </gap>is a truth, we are to conſider them all; but it is very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable that in this place God calls <hi>Job</hi> to behold the beaſts of
<pb n="611" facs="tcp:48669:317"/> the field in general, and not rather ſome one in ſpecial: And I may give four reaſons for it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe in the former Chapter God had ſpoken of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers particular beaſts of the earth; and therefore doubtleſs here alſo he ſpeaks of ſome particular beaſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That creature which is joyned with <hi>Behemoth</hi> in this diſcourſe, is by moſt taken for a particular kind of fiſh in the Sea; and therefore 'tis moſt congruous, that <hi>Behemoth</hi> ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note ſome particular kind of beaſt at land.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly and chiefly, The deſcription given here of <hi>Behemoth</hi> will not fit all ſorts of beaſts in the field, it will not fit a ſheep, nor a bullock. What is ſaid of <hi>Behemoth</hi> exceeds the proportion and conſtitution of all ſuch and many other beaſts.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Behemoth</hi> is ſaid to feed, <hi>where all the beaſts of the field do play</hi> (ver. 20.) and therefore we cannot underſtand all the beaſts of the field by him; no, nor (which ſome of the Jewiſh writers inſiſt much upon) all the greater beaſts of the field. And therefore we may conclude, that this word <hi>Behemoth</hi> (though in it ſelf a plural word) is here intended of a ſingular beaſt; and, becauſe there is no greater beaſt upon the earth than the <hi>Elephant,</hi> therefore moſt interpreters (both ancient and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern) determine it upon the Elephant, to whom (among all the beaſts of the earth) thoſe ſix particulars (mentioned in the following deſcription of <hi>Behemoth</hi>) are ſuppoſed moſt fitly to agree.</p>

                     </note>And whereas 'tis objected, the word <hi>Behemoth</hi> is of the plural number, that is eaſily anſwered, and wiped off; for nothing is more uſual in the Hebrew language, than to expreſs great things by a plural word; and ſo the Elephant may be called <hi>the beaſts,</hi> Either, Firſt, with reſpect to the vaſtneſs of his body, as if he did comprize, or were a comprehenſion of all other beaſts. Or, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, with reſpect to ſome extraordinary qualification or emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency found in him, in which reſpect, it is ſaid at the 19th verſe, <hi>He is the chief of the ways of God.</hi> As the Hebrew ſets out ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent things by words of the <hi>ſuperlative degree,</hi> ſo likewiſe by words of the <hi>plural number,</hi> or it uſeth the plural number to ſignifie the ſuperlative degree. The Elephant is <hi>the Beaſt, the Beaſt of Beaſts,</hi> a beaſt above all beaſts. Thus (<hi>Prov.</hi> 1.20.) Chriſt is called in the plural number <hi>wiſdoms,</hi> becauſe of the excellency of
<pb n="610" facs="tcp:48669:317"/> his wiſdom. Again (<hi>Prov.</hi> 9.1.) <hi>Wiſdom</hi> (ſo we tranſlate, but the word is <hi>wiſdoms) hath built her houſe,</hi> that is, Jeſus Chriſt hath. And he is expreſt by a plural word, to note that all ſorts and degrees of wiſdom meet in him; according to that of the Apoſtle (<hi>Col.</hi> 2.3.) <hi>In him are hid all the treaſures of wiſdom and knowledg.</hi> As <hi>David</hi> when he would ſhew how very fooliſh and beaſtly he had been, in miſ-judging the diſpenſations of God; Firſt, in afflicting the godly; Secondly, in proſpering evil men: When (I ſay) he conſidered, how fooliſhly he had done in envying at, or in being troubled about their proſperity; he concludes (<hi>ver.</hi> 22.) <hi>So fooliſh was I and ignorant, even as a beaſt before thee.</hi> The Hebrew uſeth the word in the Text, <hi>Behemoth, even as beaſts before thee.</hi> As if he had ſaid, the beaſtlineſs of all beaſts centred in me, and all their ignorance, while my ſpirit was ſo troubled in this matter concerning the providences of God, towards my ſelf who ſerve him, and thoſe who ſerve him not. Thus <hi>David,</hi> that he might fully acknowledg, how <hi>very a beaſt</hi> he was, in ſo ſpeaking and ſo thinking, calls himſelf <hi>Behemoth, Beaſts.</hi> This may ſuffice to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the Reader why we expound the Text of a particular beaſt, and why moſt pitch it upon the Elephant among all beaſts in ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, though the word be of the plural number. There being no proper or peculiar name in Scripture for the Elephant, it is moſt probable that he is here named by this Appellative word plural.</p>
                  <p>Yet (before I ſtep further into that large deſcription which the Lord gives of <hi>Behemoth</hi>) I cannot forbear to take notice, that the ſame induſtrious and learned Author,<note place="margin">

                        </gap>hat 'tis ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent they are beaſts of a huge bulk: Whence it comes to paſs, that moſt of the later Writers have thought <hi>Behemoth</hi> to be the
<pb n="612" facs="tcp:48669:318"/> 
                        <hi>Elephant,</hi> and <hi>Leviathan</hi> the <hi>Whale;</hi> this being without contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie the greateſt Animal that lives in the waters, and that the greateſt that lives upon the Land. To whoſe Judgement I ſhould have willingly aſſented, but that conſidering the matter more narrowly, I ſaw many things ſpoken of them, even in approved verſions, which no way agree with the nature of the Elephant and the Whale. I ſhall not ſay that Interpreters prepoſſeſſed with this opinion, have wreſted ſome things another way, which if they were rightly unfolded according to the Hebrew, it would appear as clear as the light, that under theſe names <hi>Behemoth</hi> and <hi>Leviathan,</hi> two animals are characteriz'd extreamly different from the Elephant and the Whale; but which they are, is not eaſie to determine. Yet it doth not a little pleaſe me, that <hi>Beza</hi> and <hi>Diodate,</hi> men of a moſt clear judgement, and of no ordinary learning, do conclude <hi>Leviathan</hi> to be the <hi>Crocodile</hi> of <hi>Nilus.</hi> Whence I have a ſtrong conjecture, that <hi>Behemoth</hi> is an animal of the ſame neighbourhood, even an Inhabitant of <hi>Nilus,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Hippopotamus</hi> (or the <hi>River-horſe.</hi>) I would have none trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with the newneſs of this opinion, but firſt weigh my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; whereof let this be the firſt: That, as upon the former ſtage, in the cloſe of the 38th, and throughout the 39th Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, only terreſtrial animals were preſented; ſo it ſeems moſt congruous, that upon this only aquatical or water-animals ſhould be preſented, leſt the courſe of proceeding ſhould be diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. So that, Leviathan (as all agree) being a creature that lives in the water, 'tis probable <hi>Behemoth</hi> doth ſo too, both being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in the ſame ſeries of diſcourſe. That the ancient <hi>Jews</hi> were of this opinion, may be collected out of the ſecond Book of <hi>Eſdras,</hi> Chap. 6. verſ. 47, 48, 49. where <hi>Behemoth</hi> is placed among the aquatical Animals, created the fifth day. Further, the <hi>Hippopotame</hi> and the <hi>Crocodile,</hi> are fitly joyned together, becauſe there is a great likeneſs of nature between theſe two, for both are very big and fierce, and amphibious, and four-footed, and both have one common habitation, the River <hi>Nilus;</hi> which <hi>Pliny</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo takes notice of (<hi>lib.</hi> 28. <hi>cap.</hi> 8.) and therefore moſt Writers handle them together. Nor doth the name <hi>Behemoth</hi> unfit the <hi>Hippopotame,</hi> ſeeing the Hebrew word <hi>Behema</hi> is appliable to all four-footed beaſts, to thoſe eſpecially which are of greater bulk, as is the <hi>Hippopotame;</hi> of which the Ancients ſpeak vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly,
<pb n="613" facs="tcp:48669:318"/> becauſe the ſtature of beaſts of the ſame kind is alſo vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. None make him leſs than <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> who gives him the <hi>big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of an Aſs.</hi> But <hi>Herodotus</hi> ſaith, <hi>he is as big as the biggeſt Ox.</hi> In <hi>Diodorus</hi> he is deſcribed no leſs than five cubits. <hi>Achil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les Statius</hi> ſaith, he is in appearance and compoſure of his parts, like a horſe, but three times as big. Moreover, the ſame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor calls him, <hi>The Egyptian Elephant,</hi> becauſe he is judged next him in ſtrength. Hence it is that barbarous Writers (who the Author means by them, I do not well underſtand) compare the <hi>Hippopotame</hi> with, or prefer him before the Elephant in ſtrength and ſtature; of which the Author gives other proofs; and adds, I know <hi>Mercer</hi> and others define the Hebrew word <hi>Behema,</hi> a four-foo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Nevertheleſs, if it were true, that the word <hi>Behema</hi> is applicable to terreſtrial beaſts only, yet the <hi>Hippopotame</hi> may be reckoned among them, becauſe he is an Amphibion, or an Animal that lives partly on the Land, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the water. Secondly, Becauſe he is in ſhape like thoſe beaſts which live only upon the Land. Surely there is no water-Animal that is ſo like Land ones as he is. Whence it is, as I conceive, that among all water-Animals, he alone may be called, by way of excellency, <hi>Behema</hi> or <hi>Behemoth,</hi> which according to the <hi>Egyptian</hi> dialect, is a word of the ſingular, not of the plural num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; of which he gives many parallel inſtances in other words of the ſame language.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>The Learned Author having laid down theſe general reaſons, or grounds of his opinion, goeth on with an elaborate expoſition of the Text in <hi>Job,</hi> in purſuance of, and conformity thereunto. And though I ſhall not depart from the common opinion, that by <hi>Behemoth</hi> the <hi>Elephant</hi> is meant here, and afterwards the <hi>Whale</hi> by <hi>Leviathan</hi> (having indeed caſt my meditations ſo, long before this noble work of <hi>Bochartus</hi> came to my hand) yet I owe ſo much reverence and reſpect to the name and labours of ſo worthy a perſon, as to give hints in paſſage, concerning, at leaſt ſome of thoſe particulars in the Text, which he conceives moſt fitly agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Hippopotame</hi> in the Lords deſcription of <hi>Behemoth,</hi> and
<pb n="614" facs="tcp:48669:319"/> to the <hi>Crocodile,</hi> in his deſcription of <hi>Leviathan,</hi> leaving the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at liberty to pitch his judgement, as he finds light and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon leading him.</p>
                  <p>For, though to hit the right meaning of every word in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is not only moſt deſirable and aimable, but that which we ſhould make conſcience of (in which regard we are much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to their labours who contribute any further help towards that attainment) yet in this matter an unwilling miſtake is not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dangerous, there being ſo great a likeneſs between ſome crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, in their nature, ſtature, qualities and parts, that where the Spirit of God in Scripture intends one by ſuch a name, another may eaſily be taken as intended by it.</p>
                  <p>Further, take which you will of theſe Animals, whether the <hi>Elephant</hi> or <hi>Hippopotame</hi> for <hi>Behemoth,</hi> or the <hi>Whale</hi> or <hi>Crocodile</hi> for <hi>Leviathan,</hi> there are ſome things in the textual deſcription of them by God himſelf, which cannot without difficult obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions be applied, either to the one or to the other. All which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe, not from the darkneſs of the Scriptures, but, from the darkneſs of our underſtanding, both as to the Scriptures themſelves, and the creatures treated of in them.</p>
                  <p>All that I ſhall ſay in this controverſie about the two creatures here, and in the next Chapter ſpoken of, is,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That the moſt common and received opinion, among very learned men, is, that by <hi>Behemoth</hi> is meant the <hi>Elephant;</hi> not the <hi>Egyptian Elephant,</hi> as the <hi>Hippopotame</hi> hath been called, but the proper <hi>Elephant.</hi> As alſo, that by <hi>Leviathan</hi> we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the <hi>Whale,</hi> or ſome mighty fiſh of the <hi>Cetacean</hi> breed. Now as 'tis never good to follow the practice or example of the rude and ignorant multitude, ſo we ſhould not eaſily recede from the opinion and judgement of a grave and knowing multitude.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I ſuppoſe it will not be denyed, that the <hi>Elephant</hi> is an Animal much more known, and of a more honourable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port than the <hi>Hippopotame;</hi> and that the <hi>Whale</hi> for greatneſs much exceeds, and is in that reſpect, at leaſt, more famous than the <hi>Crocodile.</hi> Therefore the Lord ſpeaking of the chief works of his hands, among viſible irrational creatures, in this latter part of his ſpeech to <hi>Job,</hi> may be conceived to intend the former under both titles, rather than the latter.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I muſt confeſs, I have a little prejudice againſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding
<pb n="615" facs="tcp:48669:319"/> 
                     <hi>Behemoth</hi> by the <hi>Hippopotame,</hi> and <hi>Leviathan</hi> by the <hi>Crocodile,</hi> even for this reaſon, becauſe they are Amphibions; for, Firſt, as all creatures of that ſort have an uncouthneſs, and a kind of monſtroſity in their naturals; ſo they have no commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable ſignification in our morals, they bearing the reſemblance of indifferent and middle men, who are (as we ſpeak proverbially) <hi>neither fleſh nor fiſh,</hi> who abide neither at Land nor in the water, neither in this nor that, but to ſerve their own turns and reach their own ends, can be here and there, or any where, or any thing. Now the Lord deſcribing here (as was ſaid before) ſuch animals as are the chief of his wayes and works, Amphibions (to me) ſeem not ſo competent for, nor deſerving of ſuch high <hi>Elogiums.</hi> Secondly (with the favour of that learned Author) it appears to me more probably, that God intended to conclude his ſpeech to <hi>Job</hi> about the creatures, by ſetting thoſe two before him which are moſt eminent, the one upon the Land, the other in the Sea, rather than by ſetting two before him, either of which are challenged in part by both. Nor is it to me very probable, that God having deſcribed ſeveral perfect fowls of the air, and beaſts of the earth, ſhould not inſtance in any one perfect fiſh of the Sea, which he hath not done, unleſs <hi>Leviathan</hi> be, not an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phibion, but, a perfect fiſh. Somewhat further may be offered towards a proof, that <hi>Leviathan</hi> is ſo, when I come to the 41. Chapter; I ſhall now proceed with <hi>Behemoth. Behold now Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemoth, which</hi>
                     <q>I made with thee.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here <hi>Behemoth</hi> is deſcribed by his Author and maker. <hi>I made him</hi> (ſaith the Lord) he is my workmanſhip; and I made him
<q>With thee.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>God ſpake thus, as it may be conceived,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To humble <hi>Job</hi> by this conſideration, that the <hi>Elephant</hi> or <hi>Behemoth</hi> was of his making as well as himſelf; as if, when the Lord ſaid, <hi>I made him with thee,</hi> his meaning were, <hi>He is thy fellow-creature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>I made him with thee;</hi> that is, though he be a great beaſt, the greateſt that lives and moves on the earth, yet I made him as well as I made thee, or the leaſt worm of the earth.</p>
                  <pb n="616" facs="tcp:48669:320"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, Theſe wo ds, <hi>I made him with thee,</hi> may be referred to the time of <hi>Behemoths</hi> making, <hi>I made him the ſame day with thee;</hi> for all the beaſts of the earth were made upon the ſixth day, the ſame day in which man was made.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Which I made with thee,</hi> that is, I made him to <hi>be with thee;</hi> I did not make <hi>Behemoth</hi> as I made <hi>Leviathan,</hi> to play in the Sea, but I made him to be with thee on the Land, that thou ſhouldſt behold him, and take notice of him, or that he ſhould be under thy hand; yea, not only ſo, but (contrary to the nature of wilde beaſts) to love thy company, and to deſire converſe with thee, to be guided by thee, and in many things to act with a kind of reaſon and underſtanding like thee, or as thy ſelf and other men do.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>Which I made with thee,</hi> that is, <hi>for thee;</hi> I made him for thy uſe, I made him to ſerve thee, Though he be thus great and vaſt, yet he will be thy humble ſervant. There will be occaſion afterwards to ſhew further, how ſerviceable and uſeful Elephants are to man.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, I made him <hi>with thee,</hi> that is, I made him as nigh to thee as any of the unreaſonable creatures; yea, nigher to thee than any of the unreaſonable creatures, for I have made him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel them all as thou excelleſt him, he is above other irrational creatures, as thou art above all irrationals: <hi>He</hi> (next to Angels and men) <hi>is the chief of my wayes.</hi> The word, <hi>made,</hi> may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port this alſo, and ſo it is uſed (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.6.) <hi>The Lord advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced</hi> (the Heb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>In all theſe reſpects we may underſtand the Lord ſaying to <hi>Job,</hi> concerning <hi>Behemoth, I made him with thee. He is thy fellow-creature; and how great ſoever he is, he is my creature. I made him the ſame day that I made thee, and I made him to abide in the ſame place with thee, or where thy abode is; I made him alſo for thy ſervice, and that he might be a meet ſervant for thee; I have made him almoſt a partaker of reaſon with thee, ſo far at leaſt a partaker of reaſon, that he will very obſequiouſly ſubmit to, and follow the conduct of thine; and though he be the ſtrongeſt beaſt on earth, yet thou mayeſt find him acting more according to thy reaſon than his own force or ſtrength.</hi>

                  <p>Thus the Elephant was made with man. But how lives he? how feeds he? Not like man.</p>
                  <q>He eateth graſſe as an Oxe.</q>
                  <p>From theſe words alſo the Authour laſt mentioned collects an argument for the ſtrengthening of his interpretation. The Oxe and Elephant (ſaith he) are alike labouring beaſts, and therefore no wonder if they feed alike, or live upon the ſame kind of food; but that the <hi>Hippopotame,</hi> which is an aquatical Animal, and abides for the moſt part in the bottom of <hi>Nilus,</hi> ſhould eat graſſe like an Oxe, this is ſtrange, and matter of wonderment. Nor is it for nothing, that he is compared to the Oxe, whom he reſembles not onely in his food, but in the bigneſſe of his body, and in the ſhape of his head and feet; whence the <hi>Italians</hi> call him <hi>Boma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin,</hi> that is, the <hi>Sea-Oxe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet theſe words may very well be applied to the Elephant, It being not onely true, that his food is graſſe, but a merciful won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that it is ſo; For <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

So that theſe words, <hi>He eateth graſſe as an Oxe,</hi> may carry this ſenſe: As if the Lord had ſaid, <hi>Though I have made this beaſt ſo great and ſtrong, yet he is no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, no ravenous beaſt; he doth not live by preying upon other beaſts, by tearing and worrying ſheep and Lambs, as Lions, and Bears, and Wolves do; this great and mighty creature eats graſſe l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="618" facs="tcp:48669:321"/> as an Oxe;</hi> yet not altogether as the Oxe. His food is as the food of an Oxe for the matter, both eat graſſe, but he doth not eat in the ſame manner as an Oxe. Why, how doth an Oxe eat? by licking up the graſſe with his tongue into his mouth, as he is deſcribed (<hi>Numb.</hi> 22.4.) but the Elephant gathers up the graſſe with his trunk, and then puts it into his mouth. Naturaliſts give theſe two reaſons why the Elephant cannot eat like the Oxe.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>He hath ſtrength proportionable to his greatneſs. And as <hi>Sampſons</hi> ſtrength was ſymbolically in his locks, ſo the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants ſtrength is naturally in his loins; there's the ſeat of ſtrength in moſt creatures. <hi>His ſtrength is in his loins;</hi> that is, he hath very ſtrong loins, and is therefore very ſtrong: the loins being, as was ſaid, the natural ſeat of ſtrength. To gird up the loins to do a thing, is to do it ſtrongly. A weak man, a man of little ſtrength, is ſaid to have <hi>no loins,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Elumbus ſive elumbis, quaſi ſine lumbis, <hi>i. e.</hi> viribus. <hi>Druſ.</hi>
                     </note> or to be (if I may ſo ſpeak) <hi>a loinleſſe man.</hi> And hence the failing or ſhaking of the loins, notes the failing of ſtrength, and want of ſpirits, to atchieve any great thing. <hi>David</hi> ſpeaking of the woful condition of the rejected <hi>Jews,</hi> and the curſe of God upon them, gives it thus (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.23.) <hi>Let their eyes be darkened, that they ſee not, and make their loins continually to ſhake;</hi> that is, let them alwayes be in a weak and low condition, let them not gather ſtrength nor courage: The effect of which curſe is evident upon that people at this day, <hi>their loins ſhake,</hi> they gather no conſiderable ſtrength, they do no conſiderable thing, nor ſhall, till they return to the Lord. It is ſaid of the vertuous woman (<hi>Prov.</hi> 31.17.) <hi>She girdeth her loins with ſtrength,</hi> that is, ſhe is ready and able for any work or acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on within her ſphere, or becoming her ſex.<note place="margin">Non rectè no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtri quod de lumbis dicitur adlibidinema, commodant, cum <hi>Eliphas</hi> tradatur eſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal maximè pudicum. <hi>Merc.</hi>

                  <p>As much as to ſay he is ſtrong every-where; he is ſtrong in back, and ſtrong in belly. The Navel is the ſtrength of the lower parts of the body, as the loin of the upper. The Navel is as the center of the body, there is a colligation or knitting of ſeveral veins and arteries, which paſs from thence into ſeveral parts of the body, as Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts obſerve. There is ſo much force in the <hi>Navel,</hi> that it may well be called <hi>the ſecond ſeat of ſtrength.</hi> When the Lord would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage us to <hi>fear</hi> him, and <hi>depart from evil,</hi> he makes this a motive (<hi>Prov.</hi> 3.8.) <hi>It ſhall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones;</hi> that is, thou ſhalt have much health and ſtrength, much comfort and ſweetneſs in thy life.</p>
                  <q>His force is in the Navel of his Belly.</q>
                  <p>His ſtrength is not in his horns to do hurt, as the Bulls and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corns; nor in his claws, to tear, as the Lions and Bears; but in his Loins and Navel. As if the Lord had ſaid, <hi>I have placed the ſtrength of</hi> Behemoth, <hi>where it may be most uſeful or ſerviceable, and least hurtful: I have endowed and furniſhed him with wonderful ſtrength; but how, and where? Not in any offenſive part, his head hath no horns, his feet no claws, to do miſchief with; but to the end he might be more ſerviceable to man in bearing burdens, I have pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced it chiefly in his Loins and Belly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet ſaith the learned <hi>Bochartus,</hi> This latter part of the verſe doth not agree with the Elephant, ſeeing both <hi>Pliny</hi> and <hi>Solinus</hi> teach us, that the Elephant hath indeed a very hard skin upon his back, but a ſoft one under his belly; whence it is (ſaith he) that the <hi>Rhinoceros</hi> fighting with the Elephant, aimes chiefly at his belly, which he knows is his tendereſt part. He gives many other proofs of this, as alſo that the <hi>Hippopotame</hi> hath a skin ſo extreamly thick and hard, that 'tis even impenitrable.</p>
                  <p>To this I may anſwer, That though it be granted that the <hi>Hippop tame</hi> hath a very hard skin all over his body, and not at all denied that the skin of the Elephant is ſofter by much under his belly, than upon his back; yet it cannot (in my underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) be hence concluded that he hath not a great force in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel of his Belly. For though he hath not a hardneſſe there to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the point either of a natural or artificial weapon, yet he may
<pb n="621" facs="tcp:48669:322"/> have a force there enabling him to do mighty things. 'Tis rather from the compactneſs, or well knitting of the Navel, that he or any other like creature hath his force, than from the hardneſſe of it; nor doth the Hebrew word [<gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Secondly, Others expound the Original word, of his <hi>ſnout or trunk,</hi> which is of great force and ſtrength; and they conceive it may well be underſtood of his trunk or ſnout, both becauſe that is great and long like a Cedar; as alſo, becauſe the trunk be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo principal a part of this beaſt, it is not probable the menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it ſhould be wholly omitted in this deſcription, and ſo ſmall and inconſiderable a one as the tail taken notice of.

                  <p>Bones are the ſtrength and ſtability of the body, and they keep the body ſtrait. Bones are to the body as poſts to a houſe, the ſtayes and ſupporters of it.

Some conceive, his bones are ſaid to be as ſtrong pieces of braſs, becauſe the Elephant cannot bow (that's an old opinion) as if he were all bone, and had no joints; which opinion is at large confuted by a learned Phyſician,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Brown</hi> of vulgar errors <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 1.</note> in his book of <hi>vulgar Errors,</hi> who proves, and experience teacheth, that the Elephant hath Joynts with his bones, as other living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures have, though not ſo apparent. His bones being great and ſtrong, he muſt needs be very ſtrong. It is ſaid (<hi>Gen.</hi> 49.14.) <hi>Iſſachar is a ſtrong aſſe:</hi>

And to ſhew that the bones of the Elephant are more than ordinarily ſtrong, they are compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to braſſe. <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, in his complaint at the ſixth Chapter, <hi>Is my fleſh braſs?</hi> Am I ſtrong like braſs? The bones of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>are ſo, and not only ſo, but
<q>His bones are like bars of iron.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The word here rendred bones, is not the ſame as in the former

                  <q>His bones are like bars of iron.</q>
                  <p>Iron is the ſtrongeſt of all metals, as we read in the viſion of the four Monarchies (<hi>Dan.</hi> 2.1.) The image had <hi>a head of gold</hi> (ſignifying the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Monarchy) <hi>breaſts of ſilver</hi> (ſignifying the <hi>Perſian) belly of braſs,</hi> ſignifying the <hi>Grecian,</hi> but it had <hi>legs of iron,</hi> ſignifying the <hi>Romane</hi> Monarchy; of which 'tis ſaid in the 40th verſe, <hi>The fourth Kingdom ſhall be ſtrong as iron, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as iron breaketh in pieces and ſubdueth all things.</hi> So then, when the Lord ſaith, <hi>His bones are like bars of iron,</hi> this import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that the bones of <hi>Behemoth</hi> are exceeding ſtrong, as ſtrong as if made of iron. We call a very ſtrong man, <hi>iron-ſides.</hi> The Elephant hath iron-ſides, <hi>His bones are as bars of iron.

                  <p>The word is, <hi>He is the head of the wayes of God:</hi> Or, <hi>he is the beginning of the wayes of God,</hi> as the word is uſed (<hi>Gen.</hi> 1.1.) <hi>In the beginning God created the Heavens and the earth.</hi> There is a twofold beginning or head (as we may ſay) Firſt, there is a beginning as to time; ſo the word is taken in <hi>Geneſis:</hi> There <hi>in the beginning,</hi> is, in the firſt of time, God created the Heavens and the earth, ſo <hi>Gen.</hi> 10.10. <hi>The beginning of his Kingdom was Babel,</hi> or, there he began his Kingdom, the beginning in time, as well as place, was there.

                  </p>
                  <p>But you will ſay, how is the Elephant <hi>the chief of the wayes of God.</hi> Are not Angels and men (at leaſt) above him?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, There is a twofold <hi>chief;</hi> Firſt, Abſolute; Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in its kind. <hi>Behemoth</hi> is the <hi>chief of the wayes of God,</hi> not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely, not as if God had made nothing more excellent than the Elephant, but in his kind, that is, among the beaſts of the earth he is the chief, and as we ſay, <hi>bears away the bell</hi> from all the reſt. <hi>Behemoth</hi> is not only of <hi>the firſt three,</hi> but (like <hi>Adino</hi> the <hi>Tachmonite</hi> among <hi>Davids</hi> worthies) he is the firſt of the firſt three, among all the irrational creatures which move upon the face of the earth. And though in ſome one thing many excel him, yet taking him altogether, he excels them all, <hi>He is the chief of the wayes of God,</hi> that is, of the <hi>works of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The works of God are called his ways, becauſe he appears &amp; ſtands forth in his works, as man doth in his way. God did not appear at all til he did create, &amp; then he appeared gloriouſly in all his divine perfections of power, wiſdom and goodneſs. And as he appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the works of creation, ſo he daily appeareth in his wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ks of providence as in his way, for in them alſo it is ſeen how power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, how wiſe, how good he is. <hi>Behemoth,</hi> both as to creation and providence, is the chief of the wayes or works of God in
<pb n="625" facs="tcp:48669:324"/> his kind: Angels and Men are indeed above him, but as for other creatures, <hi>Behemoth is the chief.</hi> Thus the Lord having ſpoken of many particular excellencies in this creature, recapitulates or ſums up all that he had ſaid (like an eloquent Orator,) in theſe <hi>crowning words, He is the chief of the ways of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note, Firſt;
<q>There is a difference as to excellency, or there are degrees of excellency in the works of God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>God hath beſtowed more upon ſome creatures, than he hath upon others. God beſtowed moſt upon man in the firſt creation; for how excellent ſoever he made any viſible creature, yet it is ſaid of no creature he made him <hi>in his image, after his likeneſs,</hi> till he came to man: and the new creature which comes in by redemption, is far more excellent than man in his firſt creation. Now, I ſay, as man is far more excellent than all earthly creatures, he is next to Angels; man is placed in the uppermoſt form of the viſible world. So among the creatures, there are ſome that very much excel others; here's one called the chief of the ways of God himſelf. This is not an Orators flattery: the Spirit of God gives <hi>Behemoth</hi> this encomium, this commendation, he hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency by a divine right. All creatures are not alike, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not all be chief, and there are none like this, he is the chief of all. Among the inanimate creatures there is a gradual diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.40.) <hi>There are coeleſtial bodies, and bodies ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtial; but the glory of the coeleſtial is one, and the glory of the terreſtial is another:</hi> and all coeleſtial bodies are not alike, for, <hi>There is one glory of the Sun, and another of the Moon, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Stars, and one Star differs from another in glory.</hi> There are alſo various excellencies, both as to kind and degree, among vegetatives or plants. What is a Nettle in the Ditch, to Hyſope in the Garden? and what is the Thiſtle in <hi>Lebanon,</hi> to the Cedar in <hi>Lebanon?</hi> that's one of the loweſt and moſt ignoble plants, this one of the higheſt and moſt honourable.

<pb n="626" facs="tcp:48669:325"/> as much excel other men, as all men excel beaſts; yea, there is a difference in the ſame man, his ſoul is more excellent than his body; ſome parts of the body are more excellent than others, ſome powers and faculties of the ſoul are more excellent than the reſt. The Apoſtle (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28, 29.) ſpeaking of the Church, ſhews how God hath put the guides of it into ſeveral ranks: He hath ſet ſome <hi>in the Church;</hi> Firſt, <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <hi>Prophets;</hi> Thirdly, <hi>Teachers; after that miracles, then gifts of healing, helps, governments, diverſities of tongues. Are all Apoſtles? are all Prophets? are all Teachers? do all ſpeak with tongues? are all workers of miracles?</hi> are all chief? are all in the firſt rank? no, ſome are in one condition, ſome in another. And thus it is in the world, God hath ſet ſome Kings, all others Subjects; and among them, ſome are Lords, ſome Judges and Magiſtrates, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Are all Kings? are all Lords? are all Judges and Magiſtrates? ſurely not. To have all men of one order, would put all men, and all things too, out of order. There is a chief among beaſts; <hi>And thoſe men are worſe than beaſts, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge not a chief among men. God is not the author of confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as in all the Churches of the Saints</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.33.) ſo, I may ſay, in all the Kingdoms of the world.</p>
                  <p>And if ſo, I would only infer, then let none be troubled that they are not chief, no, nor that they are not of equal rank with other men; let us be content with our ſtation, though it be a low one. 'Tis beſt for us to be where God hath placed us, and to be thankful for what God hath given us, though in gifts and parts we are much inferior to many. God doth not beſtow a like mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of gifts, no, nor of grace upon all. And though it may be a favour and a mercy to have outward preheminency above others, yet to love or affect preheminency, as the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> taxed <hi>Diotrophes,</hi> is very ſinful. The Apoſtle would have us <hi>covet ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly</hi> the beſt gifts (1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.31.) and he there minds us of a better thing to be coveted than the beſt gifts, that is, grace, <hi>Faith, hope, charity;</hi> to covet theſe is a bleſſed covetouſneſs: Yet neither are theſe to be coveted meerly for ſelf-ends, but as by them we may be fitted and furniſhed to do good, to honour God, and ſerve our generation according to his will. To affect chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in any thing but in grace and goodneſs is not good; and our
<pb n="627" facs="tcp:48669:325"/> affecting of them muſt be without affectation, though it ought to be with ſtrength of affection. And if we are chief, or have the preheminence above others in the things of this world, it will be well with us (as to that matter) if we are, where the hand of God, not any ambitious deſires or practiſes of our own, hath ſet us. It was the Lord who made and called <hi>Behemoth, The chief of his ways.</hi>

                  <p>Yet if what is written of the Elephant may obtain credit, I much believe that he bears away the bell from the <hi>Hippopotame</hi> for natural ſagacity and ingenuity, as alſo for quantity, and large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his limbs, and ſo of his whole body.

                  <p>Firſt, He is ſaid to excel all beaſts in the bulk of his body, or in bigneſs. He hath huge limbes, huge bones, and a height com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſurable. Natural Hiſtorians give us theſe dimenſions and proportions of him. His height (I mean, if fully grown) is reckoned (according to our meaſure) <hi>ten foot and a half.</hi> Others report, that in <hi>India</hi> there are Elephants of <hi>thirteen foot and a half</hi> in height: and what the bulk of his whole body is, we may col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect by his teeth. The Elephant hath two teeth growing upward out of his lower mandible or jaw, of a vaſt bigneſs, and eight foot in length. <hi>Coeſar Scaliger</hi> ſaith (from the report of ſome <hi>Indian</hi> Hiſtorians) that two of thoſe teeth have weighed three hundred twenty and five pounds.

                     </note>The ſecond thing, wherein the Elephant ſeems chief, and to excel all the beaſts of the earth, is his ſtrength; which is ſo great, that with his trunck he will overthrow a great tree or a houſe. Elephants have ſuch ſtrength of body, that in war they carry upon their backs great towers made of timber. We read (1 <hi>Mach.</hi> 6.37.) that <hi>Antiochus</hi> had thirty Elephants in one battel which bare towers, in every one of which were thirty and two fighting men with their weapons.

He hath a kind of natural rationality, and is therefore ſaid to be next man, or to come neareſt man of any creature. There is no beaſt more pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent than the Elephant, ſaid the Romane Orator.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The Elephant excels all beaſts in the ſtrength of his memory; and he is memoriz'd for his memory of three things eſpecially. Firſt, For his memory of commands and inſtructions given him. Secondly, Of courteſies done him. Thirdly, Of unkindneſſes and injuries offered him.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, He is the chief of the ways of God, in that which muſt needs follow the former two, his underſtanding (ſuch as it is) and memory, that is, his teachableneſs, or aptneſs to learn what is taught him. Though he be a wild beaſt, yet he is eaſily tamed or brought to hand; and when he is tamed, he is as eaſily taught. The higheſt excellency of man, is when (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks of a Biſhop, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.) <hi>he is apt to teach;</hi> and the next ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of man is, when he is <hi>apt to be taught.</hi> It is the miſery of many, that they have none to teach them; and it is the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of not a few, that they will not be taught, nor receive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.

The Elephant is an apt ſcholar, he ſoon grows perfect in any piece of art or activity taught him. Some tell us, Elephants have learnt the art of dancing, and that they have learnt to draw the letters of the Greek Alphabet with their feet, and that they learn to make legs (as we ſay) or do obeyſance to Kings, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent them with crowns.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Beſides their teachableneſs, their tractableneſs and gentleneſs is wonderful. Some are apt to learn, yet will not be governed, will not be brought to good manners. Elephants are highly commended, not only becauſe they are apt to be taught, but ready to be commanded. Whatever you bid them they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently obey. There's no creature ſo quiet, ſo meek, ſo ſubmitting as the Elephant; he hurts none, unleſs provoked, and will gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly help the weak. They who write the nature of the Elephant aſſure us, that when once he is broken or tamed by man, he is ever after obedient to him, and gives him all manner of obſervance; that he even forms himſelf to the diſpoſition of his Maſter or Owner, will take meat out of his hand like a little dog, that he will (as it were) hugg and embrace his Maſter when he comes near, and will ſuffer him (without hurt) to put his head within his mouth.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, He exceeds other beaſts in uſefulneſs. He is not tractable only for a ſhew or for ſport, but he is for real ſervice. In times of peace he will do all manner of work, till the ground, carry burdens, and he is of great uſe and ſervice in time of war.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, This is admirable in the Elephant, that being ſo vaſt a creature, he hath ſuch agility of body, as was touched before; he will expreſs thoſe geſtures and motions, which require greateſt activity.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, The Elephant is highly commended for his modeſty and chaſtity.</p>
                  <p>Tenthly, For his faithfulneſs in any thing that he is charged with or ordered to do. The faithfulneſs of the Elephant ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds belief. There are not only marveils, but miracles report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Hiſtorians worthy of credit, concerning their fidelity to
<pb n="630" facs="tcp:48669:327"/> their maſters or owners, and their kindneſs and gratitude to thoſe who have ſhewed them kindneſs.</p>
                  <p>Eleventhly, The Elephant is famous for compaſſionateneſs to any that are in diſtreſs; what uſe they can be of, they will be to ſuch. <hi>Quintus Curtius</hi> reports, how the Elephant of <hi>Porus,</hi> an <hi>Indian</hi> King, when the King being wounded fell down, took him up tenderly with his trunck, and ſet him again upon his back.</p>
                  <p>Twelfthy and laſtly, Elephants excel in longevity or length of life.<note place="margin">Diutiſſime vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit. <hi>Ariſt.</hi> l. <hi>4.</hi> c. <hi>10.</hi> de Hiſt. Animal. <hi>Strabo.</hi> l. <hi>15.</hi>
                     </note> They live not only long, but very long; the God of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture having given them an excellent conſtitution or temperament of body. Good Authors tell us, they live commonly two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years, ſome three hundred years; and 'tis reported ſome have lived five hundred years.</p>
                  <p>In all theſe reſpects, we may conclude <hi>Behemoth, the chief of the ways of God.</hi> In many things he comes near to man, and in others he much exceedeth him. From all that hath been ſaid of this mighty beaſt, take theſe inferences.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, See the goodneſs of God unto man, who hath made this vaſt ſtrong creature mans ſervant, and ſo ready to obey mans com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, to bear mans burdens, and to till the earth for man, which 'tis ſaid (<hi>Chap.</hi> 39.9.) the Unicorn will never do. <hi>Will the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corn be willing to ſerve thee? Canſt thou bind the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nicorn in the furrows? will he harrow the valleys after thee?</hi> But the Elephant will do theſe ſervices, he is willing to ſerve man in peace, and to aſſiſt him in his wars. Though man be of little ſtature and ſtrength compared to an Elephant, yet God hath ſubdued the Elephant to the will, and under the power of man. Is not this a great argument of Gods great goodneſs to man? And is it not a ſtrong obligation upon man to be obedient and ſerviceable to God, who hath made ſuch a creature ſerviceable and obedient to him?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, This ſhews us, as the goodneſs of God to man, ſo the over-ruling power of God; who can make the greateſt ſtrength of his creatures, which left to themſelves might do abundance of miſchief and be hurtful, yet uſeful and helpful to us. What a world of harm might the Elephant do, yet (as was ſaid) he never hurts any, unleſs provoked. Let us adore the power of God, who over-rules the mighty ſtreng<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h of this crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, cauſing him to lay it out in a way of helpfulneſs and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:48669:327"/> to mankind. As we ſhould take notice of the goodneſs of God, when he over-rules men who have power to hurt, from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hurt, as he did <hi>Laban,</hi> who told <hi>Jacob (Gen.</hi> 31.29.) <hi>It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt, but the God of your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpake to me yeſternight,</hi> &amp;c. Many may have power in their hands to cruſh us in a moment, yet God ſtops them from ſuch a uſe of their power: this is a great argument of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God. Some men would be like Lions or Bears, if God did not check them, as <hi>David</hi> was confident he would (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 76.10.) <hi>The wrath of man ſhall praiſe thee, the remainder of wrath thou wilt reſtrain.</hi> Many have great power, and great wrath with it, and what would they not do in their powerful wrath, if God did not reſtrain all the over-plus and remainder of it, which ſerves not to advance his praiſe. Some have much wrath, but no power; theſe would do hurt if they could, but they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do much hurt. Others have much power, but no wrath; theſe will do no hurt, yet they could. A third ſort have both, they are full of power, and full of wrath; theſe both can and would do much hurt, did not God bind or bound them, ſtop them or reſtrain them. Now, I ſay, as we ſhould reverence that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful goodneſs of God, which meekens mighty beaſts, and keeps them from doing hurt, ſo we ſhould reverence and adore, that power and goodneſs, or good power of God, which bridles evil men from doing hurt with their power.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, We may infer this by way of inſtruction from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.</p>
                  <q>Men, who as to the matter and original of their bodies, are but like to beaſts, are alſo exceeded by beaſts in many bodily powers and abilities.</q>
                  <p>What is the ſtrength of a man to the ſtrength of an Elephant? and what is mans age, or the length of his life to an Elephants? And whereas men have five bodily ſenſes, there are creatures that exceed them in all. One creature hath a quicker ear,<note place="margin">Nos aper audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu, nos vincit aranea tactu, Vultur odoratu, linx viſu, ſimia guſtu.</note> another a more curious feeling, a third hath a more piercing eye, a fourth excels in ſmelling, and a fifth in taſting. Man is excell'd in his natural powers, even by meaneſt animals: This ſhould humble us; And if it ſhould humble us, that we are exceeded by them, as to ſenſitive or bodily powers, how ſhould it ſhame us to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
<pb n="632" facs="tcp:48669:328"/> by them, as to inward indowments, as to underſtanding and vertue, as to our morality and good behaviour. <hi>Be not</hi> (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>aith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 32.9.) <hi>as the horſe and mule which have no under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</hi> Yet (Pſal. 49.20.) <hi>man that is in honour and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth not, is like the beaſts that periſh.</hi> How ſad is it to ſee men who have underſtanding, yea, who are (as to worldly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns) men of great underſtanding, like horſes and mules, who have no underſtanding! They who have not a right underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, an underſtanding to know and do the will of God (<hi>a good underſtanding have all they</hi> (and none but they) <hi>that do his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,</hi> Pſal. 111.10.) are (in Scripture ſenſe) men of no underſtanding. What a reproach is it to any man, what a blot in the Eſchucheon of a man in honour, that it ſhould be ſaid of him, and he not able with truth to gain-ſay it, that he hath not ſo much underſtanding as an Elephant! that he is not ſo docile and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as an Elephant! that he is not ſo gentle and tractable as an Elephant! What, not ſo obedient to due commands, not ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive as an Elephant! what, not ſo ſerviceable and uſeful as an Elephant! what, not ſo modeſt and chaſt as an Elephant! what, not ſo compaſſionate, not ſo faithful as an Elephant! O how ſhould it ſhame us! The Scripture often ſhames us with our coming behind beaſts (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.3.) <hi>The Ox knoweth his owner, and the Aſs his maſters crib; but</hi> Iſrael <hi>doth not know, my people do not conſider:</hi> They have not ſo much knowledge nor conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration as the Ox and the Aſs. So again (<hi>Jerem.</hi> 8.7.) <hi>The Stork in the heavens knoweth her appointed times, and the Turtle, and the Crane, and the ſwallow obſerve the time of their coming; but my people know not the judgment of their God.</hi> Nor was this a reproof to the prophane world, but to the profeſſing peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, the <hi>Jews,</hi> that they were not ſo knowing, nor skilled in the judgments of God, that is, to know and do what the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God called them to do, and be, as the Crane and Swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low were obſervant of, and knew what to do, and where to be, in all changes of times and ſeaſons. And thus the ſlothful man is reproved (<hi>Prov.</hi> 6.6.) <hi>Go to the Ant thou ſluggard, conſider her ways and be wiſe;</hi> thou haſt not ſo much wit as an Ant. This were a ſhameful rebuke upon Heathens: let it not fall upon any who profeſs themſelves Chriſtians.</p>
                  <pb n="633" facs="tcp:48669:328"/>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>If beaſts exceed man in ſome things, then how much doth God exceed man in all things.</hi> The reaſon why God preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this <hi>Behemoth</hi> to <hi>Job,</hi> was to let him ſee how much himſelf ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds man, ſeeing <hi>Behemoth</hi> is not ſo much to him, as the leaſt fly to man. All creatures put together are but as <hi>the duſt of the ballance, and as the drop of the bucket to God.</hi> Thus we ſhould raiſe our ſelves, and wind up our hearts into a conſideration of the greatneſs and Almightineſs of God, when we behold great and mighty creatures. The greatneſs of the creatures ſhould be as a ladder to lift us up to God, and thereby to take meaſure (as we are able, or as well as we can, for indeed we cannot) of his immenſurable greatneſs; that's the right uſe of their greatneſs. And if by the ſight and conſideration of theſe creatures, we do not fall down and humble our ſelves, if we lye not at the foot of God, who is infinitely above theſe creatures, and our ſelves too, we neglect the ſcope of this Scripture, and of all Scriptures of like import. God is known <hi>(via eminentiae)</hi> by way of eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, in every creature, moſtly in the moſt eminent creatures, ſuch as this, whoſe deſcription hath been thus far opened.</p>
                  <p>Now having had this high encomium of <hi>Behemoth</hi> from the Lords own mouth, <hi>he is the chief of the ways of God;</hi> what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, even this, that how great ſoever this creature is, God knows how to deal with him; and God would have <hi>Job</hi> underſtand that alſo, that how great ſoever he had made him, he was able to match him, yea, to over-match him. <hi>Behemoth</hi> is no match for God; For as it followeth in the cloſe of this 19th verſe,
<q>
                        <p>He that made him, can make his Sword to approach unto him.</p>
                        <p>He that made him.</p>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe words are a periphraſis, or a circumlocution of God. The Text doth not ſay, <hi>God can make his Sword to approach unto him;</hi> but <hi>He that made him can, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence Note;
<q>God muſt and will, and he loves to be owned as a Maker.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>God hath often revealed himſelf under this Title, <hi>The Maker of heaven and of earth, and of all things both in heaven and in earth.</hi>
                     <pb n="634" facs="tcp:48669:329"/> God is the Maker of all in a threefold ſenſe, and he loves to be acknowledged as ſuch in them all. Firſt, he is the Maker of all things &amp; perſons in their natural being. Secondly, he is the Maker of all perſons in their civil being: He makes the rich, and he makes the poor; he makes the high, and he makes the low, that is, he makes one man rich and another poor, one high and another low in this world. Thirdly, he is the Maker of all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in their ſpiritual or holy being; he makes a man good, who was bad; he makes him humble, who was proud; he makes him heavenly, that was earthly; he makes him ſpiritual, who was carnal, and not only fleſhly, but <hi>in the fleſh</hi> (Rom. 8.8.) The making of the new-man, is that for which the Lord is ſpecially to be owned and honoured. We are to honour God as he is the Maker of all creatures; but we are eſpecially to honour him as he is the Maker of the New-creature. To be the Maker of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, great or ſmall, is the ſole priviledg of God. And let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that as God himſelf hath made all things, ſo he hath made all things for himſelf, that is, <hi>All beings ought to live unto him, and act for him, who is the firſt being;</hi> to him <hi>who hath given us life and breath and all things, and in whom we live, and move, and have our being,</hi> unto him we ſhould dedicate our life and breath and all things. And did we truly know (which every one pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes he knoweth) God to be our Maker, or as our Maker, it would have a mighty influence upon our hearts and lives, and even make us live to God. What ſhould not we do for him that made us? and what cannot he do with us that made us? as the Text here ſpeaks of the great <hi>Behemoth, He that made him</hi>
                     <q>Can make his Sword approach unto him.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are two readings of theſe words.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, thus, <hi>He that made him, made his Sword to be near him;</hi> That is, as God made <hi>Behemoth,</hi> ſo God made a Sword for him, that is (according to this reading) for his uſe, or for him to uſe. God hath made him a weapon: But what is the Sword which God hath made him? They who inſiſt upon this reading, taking alſo <hi>Behemoth</hi> to be the Elephant, ſay, 'tis that natural member commonly called <hi>his Trunk;</hi> that is to the Elephant as a Sword, both to defend himſelf, and to offend and wound thoſe that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt him. Thus Mr. <hi>Beza</hi> gloſſeth it; <hi>God who made him, hath fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
<pb n="635" facs="tcp:48669:329"/> him with convenient weapons, or with a weapon fit for his turn.</hi> And the ſame ſaith another learned interpreter,<note place="margin">Armavit illum Deus manu, ſeu proboſcide, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſi gladio vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di ſimo. <hi>Jun. Piſc.</hi>
                     </note> following this Tranſlation, <hi>God hath armed him with a Trunk, as with a ſtrong and a mighty ſword.</hi> There is a truth in this Tranſlation and interpretation, and it hath the ſuffrage of many worthy men for it, as the principal, if not the ſole meaning of theſe words. God who made <hi>Behemoth,</hi> hath alſo made him a Sword to defend himſelf with, that his vaſt body ſhould not be liable to every dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and affront. Take one Note from this reading.</p>
                  <q>As God hath given the Creatures a being, ſo means to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect and preſerve themſelves in their Being.</q>
                  <p>He that made him hath given him a Sword, he hath not left him naked or unarmed. Many creatures, I mean of the irrational creatures, have natural weapons, horns, hoofs, teeth, and claws, to defend themſelves with, and offend thoſe with, that trouble them. Others have only defenſive Arms, as it were, for ſafety againſt annoyance, ſhells, and thick skins. Many have neither of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive, nor defenſive armes, who yet by their natural ſwiftneſſe ſhift for themſelvs by flight, and out-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>un their dangers. There for is no creature, but hath ſome way or other for its defence. As man (the chief creature) God hath given him Reaſon to provide all ſorts of lawful means for his preſervation and defence. Take it alſo ſpiritually; God having made any man a New creature, gives him a Sword, and means of defence, to preſerve himſelf in his ſpiritual being. Every godly man hath ſpiritual weapons, <hi>the whole armour of God,</hi> for his defence againſt the Devil, his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual enemy. The Apoſtle leads us into Gods Armory, and ſhews us what weapons God hath made for the ſpiritual man, or for the preſervation of man in his ſpiritual ſtate and being (<hi>Eph.</hi> 6.13, 14, <hi>&amp;c.) The Girdle of Truth, the Breaſt-plate of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, Feet ſhod with the preparation of the Goſpel of peace, The Shield of Faith, to quench the fiery darts of the Devil, The Helmet of Salvation, and the Sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God.</hi> Thus God hath armed the New-Creature with a Sword; he that made him, hath made him weapons of defence and offence, to ſave his ſoul from the wounds of temptation, and to reſiſt, yea, overcome the Tempter. Thus, as the Lord who made <hi>Behemoth,</hi> hath made him a Sword, ſo he hath provided weapons, or means
<pb n="636" facs="tcp:48669:330"/> of defence for all other creatures, for man eſpecially, and moſt ſpecially for man in his ſpiritual condition, that his immortal ſoul may be ſafe, whatever becomes of his frail fleſh, or mortal body. So much of and from that firſt Tranſlation, <hi>He that made him, made his Sword to be near him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet before I come to explain our own Tranſlation, I ſhall here again mind the Reader, what learned <hi>Bochartus</hi> underſtands by the Hebrew word rendred <hi>Sword,</hi> in reference to the <hi>Hippopotame.</hi> He that made him (ſaith he) hath given him <hi>(Harpen) a ſickle,</hi> or <hi>crooked Sword.</hi> Our Dictionaries render the word <hi>Harpe,</hi> a Wood-knife, as alſo a Sythe. This crooked Sword or Sickle, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes, ſaith he, the long, ſharp, and ſomwhat bowed teeth of the Hippopotame, with which he doth as it were reap, or cut down co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n and graſſe, when he comes on Land to feed; as ſeveral Greek Poets, by him named, deſcribe the manner of the Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tame's feeding; which muſt be granted, complyeth well with the words in the next verſe, where 'tis ſaid of <hi>Behemoth, The Mountains bring him forth food.</hi> Yet I ſee no reaſon, but that thoſe great teeth of the Elephant (which ſurely are no hurtleſſe weapons) as alſo his <hi>Promuſcis</hi> or Trunk (though commonly called his hand) may be compared to, and expreſſed by a Sword, if that be true which good Authors ſay he doth with them.</p>
                  <p>The Second reading of the Text, which <hi>Bochartus</hi> ſaith, a very learned Interpreter perceiving the inconvenience of the former, as to the Elephant, took up, is, alſo, ours,
<q>He that made him, can make his Sword to approach unto him.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>His Sword,</hi> That is, his own Sword, Gods Sword. God hath a Sword, and he <hi>can make his Sword approach Behemoth;</hi> that is, As ſtrong as Behemoth is, God that made him, and gave him his ſtrength, can ſubdue him, can pierce his skin, though very hard, and wound him to the very heart; he can break his bones, though they are like ſtrong pieces of braſs, and bars of iron.</p>

                     </note>So then, the meaning of the words (according to our tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) is plainly this. As if the Lord had ſaid, <hi>Though Behemoth be very vaſt and big, ſtrong and torrible, yet I can quickly bring him down,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hanc expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem reſpuere videtur ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bum <gap reason="foreign">

                  </p>
                  <p>Some oppoſe this tranſlation and expoſition, becauſe the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew word which we render <hi>to approach,</hi> is not applicable (ſay they)
<pb n="637" facs="tcp:48669:330"/> to an hoſtile approach, but rather to an amicable and friendly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach: Now to come upon one with a Sword, is an hoſtile ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, 'tis to come as an enemy, which (ſay they) that word will not well bear.</p>
                  <p>But I conceive this to be a miſtake; for in Scripture, once, if not oftner, the word is uſed to denote an hoſtile approach, or an aſſault (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.40.) where <hi>David</hi> encountring <hi>Goliah,</hi> 'tis ſaid, <hi>He took his ſtaffe in his hand, and choſe five ſmooth ſtones out of the brook, and put them in a ſhepherds bag, which he had even in a ſcrip, and his ſling was in his hand, and he drew near</hi> (or <hi>approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) to the Philiſtim.</hi> Now how did <hi>David</hi> approach the <hi>Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtim?</hi> Surely, not to ſalute him as a friend, but ro deſtroy him as an enemy, as in the iſſue he did. Though the word commonly ſignifieth a friendly approach, yet the Scripture applyeth it alſo to an enemy-like or violent approach; and therefore that objection is of no force to invalidate our Tranſlation, or the Interpretation given of it: <hi>He that made him, can make his Sword approach un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But what is this Sword, that God makes to approach unto <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemoth?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, This Sword is any thing whereby God is pleaſ'd to ſubdue or deſtroy <hi>Behemoth,</hi> or the Elephant; whatever inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment God will uſe, that's his Sword; or whether God will uſe any other creature to kill the Elephant, that creature is his Sword. 'Tis ſaid, that the Rhinoceros (his ſworn enemy, if I may ſo ſpeak) gets his ſharpned horn, under his belly, and paunches him. 'Tis ſaid alſo, that the Dragon, loving to ſuck or drink his blood, kills him. Now whether the Elephant fall by theſe beaſts and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, or be ſlain in battle and war by men, he may be ſaid to fall by the ſword of God, or that God makes his ſword approach unto him. The ſword of God is the power of God put forth by this, or that, or any means, for the ſubduing or deſtroying of this mighty creature. <hi>He that made him, can make his ſword approach unto him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From this rendring, and the interpretation given of it, which is very plain and obvious,</p>
                  <pb n="638" facs="tcp:48669:331"/>
                  <p>Obſerve;
<q>There is no creature ſo great, ſo ſtrong, but God is able to ſubdue and conquer him.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He that made the creature, can make his ſword approach unto him. <hi>God can maſter whatſoever he hath made. Behemoth,</hi> the Elephant is a creature of a vaſt bigneſs, a creature of admirable ſtrength, yet down he comes, down he falls, as ſoon as ever God draws near with his ſword. The inanimate creatures, the Sun, the Moon, the Stars, the Seas, the Earth, are ſtrong and powerful; yet God can ſhake the Earth, and calm the Sea, he can ſeal up the Stars, and ſtop both Sun and Moon in their courſe, and make them ſtand ſtill as a ſtone. God who made the fire hot and burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, can take away the burning heat of it, which is ſo connatural to it. And as he ſubdueth inanimate or liveleſs creatures, ſo (as here in the Text) the animate or living creatures. The Lord, who hath made the Elephant, the Lion, the Bear, the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, can quickly put a ſtop to the power and rage of any of them. We may exemplifie it alſo in man, a rational creature. Some men, in compariſon of others, are like <hi>Behemoths,</hi> like Elephants, great, powerful and ſtrong, <hi>Nimrods</hi> of the earth, mighty hunters: The Lord can make his ſword approach to any of them. The Lord hath infinitely more ſtrength and power in himſelf, than he hath placed or planted in any creature. For, what is the ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eam to the fountain? what is the light in the air, to the light in the Sun? The ſtrength of the creature, is but a ſtream or a beam iſſuing from God. The ſtrength of the Elephant is no more to God, than the ſtrength of a ſilly Mouſe; the ſtrength of an Eagle no more to God, than the ſtrength of a Fly; the ſtrength of a Leviathan in the ſea (of whom in the next Chapter) is no more to God, then the ſtrength of a Shrimp or Sprat. God can ſoon deſtroy the roaring Lions, the raging Bears, the fierce Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, the ravening Wolves of this world.

                  <p>Now, if the Lord hath a power whereby he can quickly over-power the moſt powerful creatures; then this teacheth us,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Not to truſt in the power of any creature.</hi> Though you have an Elephant, a <hi>Behemoth</hi> for your help, do not truſt in him. The Lord that made him, can quickly make his ſword approach
<pb n="639" facs="tcp:48669:331"/> unto him; the Lord can make him as weak as water, and of as little uſe to you as a little child. <hi>The ſtrong ſhall be as tow, and the maker of it as a ſparke</hi> (that is, the work or idol which he hath made ſhall be as a ſpark to tow) <hi>and they ſhall both burn together, and none ſhall quench them (Iſa.</hi> 1.31.) How often are we called off from truſt in any creature, from truſt in horſes, from truſt in man!

                  <p>Secondly, This teacheth us, <hi>Not to fear the power of any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture while God is with us.</hi> If an Elephant, a <hi>Behemoth</hi> be againſt us, we need not fear him. Thus the Apoſtle concludes, while he puts that ſuppoſition (<hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28.) <hi>If God be with us, who can be againſt us?</hi> that is, to hurt us. His meaning is, none can. There are none in the world againſt whom ſo many are, as againſt thoſe <hi>with whom God is,</hi> that is, whom he owns, loves and favours. Chriſt told his Diſciples of this (<hi>Joh.</hi> 15.19.) <hi>I have choſen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.</hi> But though they with whom God is, are hated of the world, or have the world againſt them, yet the world cannot be ſo againſt them, as to harm or hurt them; for he that made them can make his ſword approach to thoſe that would, that is, they are fully in and under his power. The Prophet uſeth this argument (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.16, 17.) <hi>Behold, I have created the Smith that bloweth the coals in the fire, and that bringeth forth an inſtrument for his work, and I have created the waſter to deſtroy:</hi> Even the waſters of the world, they that make ſpoil of all, all they are of my creation; I have made them, and ſeeing I have made them, ſurely, I can hinder them in any of their waſting and deſtroying purpoſes; and therefore the Lord in the next words gives a full and moſt comfortable aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to the Church, notwithſtanding the skill of the Smith in making inſtruments, and the ſtrength of the Waſter to deſtroy with them, <hi>No weapon that is formed against thee ſhall proſper, and every thing that ſhall riſe againſt thee in judgment, thou ſhalt condemn; this is the heritage of the ſervants of the Lord, and their righteouſneſs is of me, ſaith the Lord.</hi> The very ground upon which the Lord aſſured them, that no weapon formed againſt them ſhould proſper, was, becauſe the Smith, and the Waſter too,
<pb n="640" facs="tcp:48669:332"/> were both of them his creatures or of his making, as the Text ſpeaks of <hi>Behemoth.</hi> God can make his ſword approach beaſts in the likeneſs of men, as well as beaſts in their own likeneſs. And hence it is, that the Holy Ghoſt expreſſeth all thoſe powers of the world, which ſhould afflict the Church in ſeveral ages, by the name of beaſts, all of Gods making. <hi>Daniel</hi> in his 7th Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter had a viſion of four great beaſts that came up from the ſea; whereof the firſt, was like a Lion; the ſecond, like a Bear; another, like a Leopard; and a fourth, dreadful, and terrible, and ſtrong; ſo exceedingly dreadful, terrible and ſtrong, that (as if no beaſt could be found like it) it is not expreſſed by the likeneſs of any beaſt. But what were theſe beaſts? 'tis anſwered (<hi>ver.</hi> 17.) <hi>Theſe great beaſts which are four, are four great Kings, which ſhall ariſe out of the earth,</hi> that is, four ſucceſſions of Kings. The <hi>Babilonian,</hi> the <hi>Perſian,</hi> the <hi>Grecian,</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> powers were thoſe great beaſts. Now the Lord who made them, made his ſword approach unto every one of them, as the hiſtories, both of the Church and of the world, hold clearly out. The Lord who made that great <hi>Behemoth</hi> the <hi>Babilonian</hi> power, and that great <hi>Behemoth</hi> the <hi>Perſian</hi> power, that great <hi>Behemoth</hi> the <hi>Grecian</hi> power, as alſo that great <hi>Behemoth</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> power, hath made his ſword, in ſeveral ages, and by ſeveral ſteps or degrees, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach unto them. So in the <hi>Revelation</hi> of Saint <hi>John,</hi> the great beaſts there mentioned, what were they, but the powers of the earth ſet againſt the true Church of God? We read (<hi>Revel.</hi> 12.3.) of a great red dragon; this red dragon was the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh <hi>Romane</hi> power perſecuting the Church. Again (<hi>Revel.</hi> 13.1.) John <hi>ſtood upon the ſand of the ſea, and ſaw a beaſt riſe up out of the ſea, having ſeven heads and ten horns.</hi> What was this beaſt? Maſter <hi>Mead</hi> ſaith, that by this beaſt, and his ſeven heads, and ten horns, we are to underſtand the Pope, with the companies or aſſociations of all thoſe Princes that put themſelves under his power; all theſe were figured (ſaith he) by that beaſt riſing up out of the ſea. At the 11th verſe of the ſame Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Saint <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>I beheld another beaſt coming out of the earth, and he had two horns like a lamb, and he ſpake like a dragon.</hi> Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calyptical Interpreters have various op<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>nions about this ſecond beaſt, but whoever, or whatever this or the former beaſt is (to be ſure they are ſome body) the ſpirit of God repreſents them as
<pb n="641" facs="tcp:48669:332"/> terrible <hi>Behemoths;</hi> and the Church hath no help nor comfort againſt them, but that in the Text, <hi>He that made them, can make his ſword approach unto them.</hi> The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> (Chap. 27.1.) ſpeaks of the Lords ſword, and of the uſe he will put it to; <hi>In that day the Lord with his ſore, and great, and ſtrong ſword ſhall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Leviathan, the piercing Serpent, even Leviathan the crooked Serpent, and he ſhall ſlay the Dragon that is in the Sea;</hi> that is, overcome the devil and all his inſtruments, who oppoſe and would deſtroy <hi>his Vineyard of Red wine,</hi> that is, his Church. Thus we ſee how the Lord in all ages paſt hath, and how we are aſſured concerning the Ages to come, that he will make that good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>myſtical Behemoths,</hi> which here he ſpeaks concerning the <hi>natural Behemoth; He that made him, can make his ſword ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach unto him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Lord having thus far deſcribed <hi>Behemoth</hi> by ſeveral parts of his body, and by his great ſtrength or power, proceeds to deſcribe him further, by the manner of his life, or by his meat, drink and lodging, in the latter part of this context, to the end of the Chapter.</p>

                  <p>Note two things from them;
<q>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> God provideth food for all creatures, even for Behemoth.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He provides them food, from the greateſt to the leaſt; they
<pb n="642" facs="tcp:48669:333"/> are all at Gods finding. And doth God take care for <hi>Behemoths,</hi> for Elephants, or, as ſome determine it, <hi>Hippopotames,</hi> River-Horſes, and Sea-monſters? Surely then (as <hi>David</hi> ſpake, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 111.4.) <hi>He will give meat to them that fear him, he will ever be mindful of his Covenant.</hi> This Inference hath been made from other paſſages in the former Chapter; I only remind the Reader of it here. The Lord, who provideth mountains of graſs, or graſs upon the mountains, for <hi>Behemoth,</hi> hath mountains of proviſion for all his faithful ſervants.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Note;
<q>God provides proportionable food for all hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Behemoth</hi> is a vaſt creature; therefore God hath whole moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains for him to graze upon, he is not ſhut up in a little pytle or narrow field, he hath large mountains for his ſtore<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>; and will not the Lord give proportionable ſupplies to his people according to all their needs? If our needs be great, his ſtore is greater, <hi>The world is mine</hi> (ſaith God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.12.) <hi>and the fulneſs of it.</hi> He that is the fulneſs of all things, and hath in his power, and at his diſpoſe, the fulneſs of all the world, will not let them, of whom the world is not worthy, want any thing that is good and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for them: The mountains and valleys too, yea, deſerts and hard rocks, ſhall bring them forth food God will turn ſtones in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to bread, and rocks into water, rather than they ſhall want. As <hi>David</hi> ſaid (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.10,) <hi>The young Lions</hi> (ſo I may ſay, the Elephants) <hi>do lack and ſuffer hunger; but they that ſeek the Lord, ſhall not want any good thing;</hi> that is, Lions and Elephants ſhall rather want than they. <hi>Surely the mountains bring him forth food,</hi>
                     <q>Where all the beaſts of the field play.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This argues the milde nature and gentleneſs of <hi>Behemoth,</hi> the Elephant, as was ſhewed at the 15th verſe; he lives upon graſs, not upon fleſh, as Lions and Bears; he lives upon graſs, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the beaſts of the field play where the Elephant feeds, for they know he will not eat nor feed upon them, he eats only graſs. Natural Hiſtorians tell us, that the beaſts ſeem to rejoyce when they ſee the Elephant, becauſe, they know he will not hurt them; not only do they feed with him to ſatisfie hunger, but play and ſport for delight.</p>
                  <pb n="643" facs="tcp:48669:333"/>

                  <p>The beaſts would have little heart to play where the Elephant feeds, were he as fierce and cruel as he is great and ſtrong. Thus the Lord orders the ſpirits of powerful men, or of men in great power, into ſuch meekneſs and gentleneſs, that even the meaneſt live quietly and peaceably by them without fear of hurt, as was toucht before. The Church is ſet forth playing, as it were, not only where the Elephant, a gentle beaſt feeds, but where wilde and ravenous beaſts feed (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.6, 7, 8, 9.) <hi>The wolfe ſhall dwell with the Lamb, the Leopard ſhall lie down with the Kid, the Calf and the young Lion and the Fatling ſhall lie down together, and a little child ſhall lead them;</hi> that is, the Wolfe ſhall not hurt the Lamb, the Leopard ſhall not trouble the Kid: yea, ſaith that illuſtrious Prophecy (verſ. 8.) <hi>The ſucking child ſhall play on the hole of the Aſp, the weaned child ſhall put his hand on the Cockatrice den, they ſhall not hurt nor deſtroy in all my holy mountain, for the earth ſhall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the Sea.</hi> The care of God over his Church and ſervants appears two wayes;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, In hiding them from ſuch as would do them hurt. As it is ſaid (<hi>Jer.</hi> 36.26.) when <hi>Baruch</hi> and <hi>Jeremiah</hi> had done that ſervice commanded them by the Lord, <hi>Jehoiakim</hi> was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, and ſent to take them; but ſaith the Text, <hi>The Lord hid them.</hi> So the Lord moved <hi>Obadiah</hi> to hide his Prophets by fifty in a cave, from the wrath of <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Jezebel</hi> (1 <hi>King.</hi> 18.) Now as the Lord keeps his ſervants, by hiding them from thoſe who are enraged againſt them, ſo</p>
                  <p>Secondly, By meekning their ſpirits, as he doth the Elephants towards the beaſts of the field, ſhewing them much kindneſs, and ſuffering them in a ſort <hi>to play before them,</hi> that is, to enjoy great tranquility. The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſaith, it was the Lord who <hi>turned the heart of the</hi> Egyptians <hi>to hate his people, and to deal ſubtilly with his ſervants (Pſal.</hi> 105.25.) And 'tis doubtleſs of the Lord, that any ſhew them favour, and deal kindly with them.</p>
                  <p>Again, from theſe words, <hi>Where all the beaſts of the field play,</hi>

                  <p>Note, Secondly;
<q>A playing life, is the life of a beaſt.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>All beaſts would live ſo; wilde beaſts do live ſo. As it is ſaid of the Leviathan in the Sea (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.26.) <hi>There go the Ships, there is that Leviathan whom thou haſt made to play therein.</hi> A life of play, is a beaſtial life. It is ſaid (<hi>Zach.</hi> 8.5.) in a way of promiſe, That <hi>boyes and girles ſhould play in the ſtreets,</hi> but men and women muſt work; it were a ſhame to deſcribe them play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The life of man is not a playing life, but a labouring life. How beaſt-like do they live, who (as it is ſaid of the people of <hi>Iſrael (Exod.</hi> 38.6.) <hi>Eat, and drink, and riſe up to play;</hi> that's juſt like a beaſt, feed on the mountains, and then play upon the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.

But though <hi>Behemoth</hi> be a great and tall beaſt, yet I nothing doubt but there are trees in and about the places which he frequents, great and tall enough to ſhadow him from the Sun when he ſtands upright, yea, and reeds of a ſufficient height to be a covert to him when he lieth down. And therefore as it was an over boldneſs in thoſe Rabbins to put an interrogation where they found none, ſo there is no need that an interrogation ſhould either be found or put there. Indeed <hi>Bochartus,</hi> who judgeth reeds much too low to make a covert for the Elephant, tells us out of <hi>Aelian,</hi> That Elephants go
<pb n="645" facs="tcp:48669:334"/> by very great trees, as we by ſtanding corn, and that ſome of them they are taller than trees. Which I conceive,<note place="margin">Aelian. <hi>l.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 6.</note> can be underſtood no other way than by a high ſtrain of Rhetorick: But ſuppoſe it true in plain and proper ſenſe, yet this gives the learned <hi>Bochartus</hi> no advantage (to which end he alleadgeth that of <hi>Aelian</hi>) for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodating of this part of the deſcription of <hi>Behemoth</hi> to the <hi>Hippopotame</hi> rather than the Elephant, becauſe he tells us from ſeveral Authors, firſt,<note place="margin">

                     </note> that the <hi>Hippopotame</hi> is not only three times bigger than the horſe, but ſecondly, that he is of equal ability with the Elephant, and for the moſt part greater. Whence it is (ſaith he) that ſome Writers compare the <hi>Hippopotame</hi> with the Elephant, both in ſtrength and ſtature, or prefer him before the Elephant; which reports (ſaith he) although they be a little ſtretcht, yet 'tis manifeſt, that the <hi>Hippopotame</hi> comes behind few ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, either in bigneſs or ſtature (that is, tallneſs) of body. And if ſo, then the Reeds of the Fen fit him as ill for a covert as the Elephant; yet I am enough ſatisfied, that they may very well fit either of them. And though the Elephant uſually ſleepeth ſtanding, and rarely lyeth down to ſleep, yet (which is not denied) he if ſometimes or at any time lyeth down to ſleep, 'tis ſufficient to anſwer the purpoſe of this Text; which ſaith (verſ. 21.) <hi>He lyeth under the ſhady trees, in the covert of the Reeds and Fens.</hi> And

                     </note> The Elephant (ſaith one of them) loveth rivers, and though he be not a river Animal, yet he may be called a river-ſide or river-bank Animal; and (ſaith the other) Elephants are greatly pleaſed with rivers, and wander much about ſtreams of water, though they cannot ſwim, by reaſon of the greatneſs of their bodies.</p>
                  <p>That is (I confeſs) a rare notion, and ſingularly ſubſervient to his opinion, that <hi>Behemoth</hi> is the <hi>Hippopotame,</hi> which the learned Author, ſo often already mentioned, gives us; namely, that by the word rendred <hi>brook,</hi> we are here to underſtand the river <hi>Nilus</hi> in <hi>Egypt.</hi> And therefore he tranſlates the Text, not as we, <hi>The Willows of the Brook,</hi> but <hi>The Willows of</hi> Nilus <hi>compaſs him about.</hi> And that the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word <hi>(Nahal)</hi> ſignifieth <hi>Nilus,</hi> he puts beyond contradiction, by quoting many expreſs places of Scripture, where it is ſo uſed (<hi>Num.</hi> 34.5. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 15.4.47. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.65. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 24.7. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.12.) which he alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms by the Authority of ſome Ancient Latine Poets, who call <hi>Nilus</hi> a Torrent or a Brook. Now though this hath very great weight with me, and may with any ingenoius Reader, to perſwade him, that the <hi>Hippopotame</hi> is intended by <hi>Behemoth</hi> rather than the Elephant,</p>
                  <p>Yet with the favour, and good leave of this worthy Author, and with ſubmiſſion to more able judgments, I would offer theſe two things to the Readers conſideration.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That though the word <hi>Nilus</hi> may draw its original (as he ſhews) from the word <hi>Nahal,</hi> according to its ancient pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation <hi>Neel;</hi> yet in no one of thoſe Scriptures by him quoted, and lately noted, is the word <hi>Nahal</hi> uſed alone (as it ſtands in this Text of <hi>Job</hi>) to ſignifie <hi>Nilus;</hi> for in all thoſe places the word <hi>Egypt</hi> is added. Now when the words are put together, The <hi>river of Egypt,</hi> no man can doubt but <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>lus</hi> muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by it. But when the word <hi>Nahal,</hi> ſignifying a Brook, Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent or river, is found ſingle and alone, there is no neceſſity that it ſhould ſignifie <hi>Nilus,</hi> the word indifferen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ly and in common, being applicable to any brook or river in any part of the whole world, as well as to <hi>Nilus</hi> in <hi>Egypt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, In one place of the holy Scripture, where this whole expreſſion in <hi>Job The willows of the brook</hi> is found, nor <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> but ſome other brook or river is without all controverſie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.
<pb n="647" facs="tcp:48669:335"/> The children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> for the celebration of the feaſt of Tabernacles were commanded (<hi>Levit.</hi> 23.40.) <hi>to cut down the boughs of thick trees, and the willows of the brook,</hi> &amp;c. which ſurely could not be meant of the willows growing about the river <hi>Nilus</hi> in <hi>Egypt;</hi> for they were come out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and this was an ordinance which the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were commanded to obſerve in the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> And as in this place of <hi>Moſes</hi> we have <hi>the willows of the brook,</hi> ſo (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 15.7.) we have, <hi>the brook of the willows,</hi> whither the ſubſtance of the <hi>Moabites</hi> ſhould be carried, by themſelves (ſay ſome) for ſafety, by their enemies, ſay others, as ſpoil. I do not find any who follow this tranſlation, interpreting <hi>the brook of the willows</hi> by <hi>Nilus</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> but ſeveral of <hi>Euphrates</hi> by <hi>Babilon</hi> in <hi>Chaldea,</hi> to which that ſpeech of the Captive <hi>Jews</hi> there (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 137.1, 2.) may give ſome light.</p>
                  <p>Theſe two things conſidered, the words of the text in <hi>Job</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Behemoth</hi> may, at leaſt, with a faire probability, be applied to the Elephant. <hi>The ſhady trees cover him with their ſhadow, the willows of the brook compaſs him about.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence Note, Firſt;
<q>God provides not only for the being of his creatures, but for for their comfortable being.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>As the Elephant hath food upon the mountains to keep him <hi>alive,</hi> ſo ſhady trees to keep him cool. And thus the Lord takes care for man, he hath not only given him bread to eat, but conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences for his delight and comfort. God makes proviſion, even for our delight, while we are in the fleſh; let us take heed we <hi>make not proviſion for the fleſh, to fulfill the luſts of it.</hi> The Elephant hath not only graſs, but ſhadows.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Note;
<q>The inconveniencies and annoyances which come to us by one creature are helped by ſome other.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>God hath ſo provided, that look in what one creature doth an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy us, another relieves us. The Elephants are much annoyd by the heat of the Sun, but they find relief under ſhady trees. The heat of the Sun is cured by ſhades and gentle winds, in thoſe parts of the world that are under or near the Line; the Lord hath
<pb n="648" facs="tcp:48669:336"/> provided cool breizes, which blowing there fan the air, and make it very pleaſant by attempering the heat. If there be poiſon in one creature to annoy, there is an antidote in ſome other to help. And in this the goodneſs of God ſhines moſt clearly, that all the inconveniences and annoyances, which come to us by men, yea, which come to us by our ſins, are all remedied by Jeſus Chriſt, or we have relief by Jeſus Chriſt againſt them all. When the heat of any affliction moleſts us, we may <hi>ſit down</hi> (as the Church ſpeaks, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.3.) <hi>under his ſhadow with great delight, and his fruit will be ſweet unto us.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt is to all believers, not only as the ſhadow of a tree, but <hi>as the ſhadow of a great rock in a weary land (Iſa.</hi> 32.2.) The Lord hath provided us ſhady trees, and the willows of the brook (bleſſed and precious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes) to compaſs us about in all our troubles.</p>
                  <p>Thus God hath given <hi>Behemoth</hi> help againſt immoderate heat; But he is ſubject to much thriſt alſo: for that he hath help at hand too, ſtore of water.</p>

                  <p>We have had <hi>Behemoth</hi> feeding upon the mountains, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing in the ſhadows; here we have him drinking in or at the river.<note place="margin">Ecce premat (eum) fluvius, non trepidabit, ſecurus erit quamvis Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danes erumpat in os ejus. <hi>Bochar.</hi>
                     </note> Theſe two verſes, as they ſtand in our tranſlation, may in a fairer ſenſe be applied to the Elephant: but before I come to that, I ſhall give a brief account of that tranſlation given by the learned Author before named; according to which, the 23d verſe is not only beſt, but only applicable to the <hi>Hippopotame. Behold, let a river preſs (or come upon) him, he will not fear; he is ſafe, though</hi> Jordan <hi>iſſue forth upon his mouth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now it's eaſily granted, that the talleſt and ſtrongeſt Elephant, would have cauſe enough to fear, if a whole river, ſuch a great and deep one as <hi>Jordan</hi> eſpecially, ſhould preſs upon him and over-whelm him, for as the Elephant is no ſwimmer, ſo he muſt have a liberty of breathing, nor can he hold his breath very long; and therefore (as it is ſaid) ventures to go no further into the water, than he can hold and keep his ſnout above water, to draw in aire and maintain reſpiration. So that in this the <hi>Hippopotame</hi> hath the advantage of the Elephant, as being able to hold his
<pb n="649" facs="tcp:48669:336"/> breath much longer. For though (ſaith he, alleadging <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> for it) as the Sea-calf, the Crocodile and Sea-ſhell-fiſh,<note place="margin">Ltb. <hi>8.</hi> de Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoria Animal. cap. <hi>2.</hi>
                     </note> ſo alſo the <hi>Hippopotame</hi> will be ſuffocated in the water at laſt, unleſs he take ſome breathing times; yet 'tis certain, he can hold his breath a long time, abiding (not being able to ſwim) whole dayes at the bottom of <hi>Nilus,</hi> creeping or lying upon the ouze, till, night ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, he goeth out to feed.</p>
                  <p>The nature of this animal being ſuch as hath been deſcribed, the tranſlation in hand anſwers it clearly.</p>
                  <p>Yet, ſeeing there are other tranſlations of this 23d verſe, left us by very learned men, and skilful in the Hebrew tongue, which may well comply with the nature of the Elephant, it cannot ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of pertinacy, to give them ſo much reſpect as to lay them before the Reader, and leave him to his own choice in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Let us conſider that in which <hi>Bochartus</hi> joynes thoſe four Worthies, <hi>Pagnine, Arias, Mercer</hi> and <hi>Junius,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Premit fluviu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ita ut non fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinet, confidit quod Jorda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem educet in os ſuum.</note> whoſe tranſlation runs thus; <hi>He checks a River, ſo that it haſtneth not; he is confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that he can draw out</hi> Jordan <hi>into his mouth.</hi> Here indeed are great Hyperbolies. 'Tis high language, to ſay, an Elephant by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſing his body like a bank, can ſtay the courſe of a River, or ſwallow it down at a draught; yet it would be no hard labour to ſhew that the Scripture hath many expreſſions in it of as high a ſtrain as this. We read of Cities walled and fenced up to heaven (<hi>Deut.</hi> 9.1.) And the Evangeliſt <hi>John</hi> ſuppoſeth (<hi>Chap.</hi> 21.25.) that if all things which Jeſus Chriſt did in the dayes of his fleſh, here on earth, ſhould be written, that <hi>even the world it ſelf could not contain the books which ſhould be written.</hi> But I ſhall not ſtay upon this, nor doth the learned <hi>Bochartus</hi> inſiſt upon it: he could admit the Hyperbolies in that tranſlation, if the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation it ſelf were conſiſtent with the Hebrew Text, in reference to which he takes five exceptions againſt that tranſlation; to every one of which I ſhall only give my apprehenſion, and ſo paſs on.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is, That the Authors of this tranſlation, ſuppoſe the Hebrew word for <hi>River,</hi> and that for <hi>Jordan,</hi> to be of the accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Caſe (as Grammarians ſpeak) whereas in the Original, they have no note of the accuſative Caſe prefixed. I may ſay to that, The note of the accuſative Caſe is not alwayes prefixt, where the
<pb n="650" facs="tcp:48669:337"/> word is ſo taken, eſpecially where the word can be no otherwiſe taken, as in the ſenſe of theſe Tranſlators it cannot be in this place; for they taking <hi>Behemoth</hi> to be the agent in both parts of the verſe, as alſo the River in the former part, and <hi>Jordan</hi> in the latter, to be patients, could not ſuppoſe any otherwiſe of thoſe words, than that they are of the accuſative Caſe; whereas <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chartus</hi> taking <hi>Behemoth</hi> to be the patient, and the <hi>River</hi> in the former part, as alſo <hi>Jordan</hi> in the latter part of the verſe, to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain the place of Agents, muſt needs ſuppoſe the contrary.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, ſaith he, Thoſe words <hi>(ita ut) ſo that,</hi> are not in the Hebrew. I anſwer, ſuch is the conciſeneſs of the Hebrew tongue, that all Tranſlators make uſe of ſome fitting words (which they diſtinguiſh from the pure Text, by a different character in print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and writing) to clear up the ſenſe of the Text in the notion of their tranſlation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">

                        </gap>
                     </note>Thirdly, he ſaith, The word rendred to <hi>Haſten,</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth not to haſten ſimply, but to haſten for fear. That's yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on all hands; and in that ſenſe I ſhall make uſe of it, in open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our own tranſlation. All that I ſhall ſay to this exception, is, that the learned Authors of this tranſlation, who wel underſtand the full ſignification of that word, might conceive that the ſame word is not alwayes uſed by the holy Ghoſt in the ſame latitude of ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, and therefore render this word, which ſignifies to <hi>haſten for fear,</hi> barely <hi>to haſten.</hi> Further, I may add, that this word which ſignifies to <hi>haſten for fear,</hi> is rendred alſo barely <hi>to fear;</hi> and why not then barely to haſten? The one tranſlation leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the former part of the full ſenſe, as the other doth the latter part of it.</p>
                  <p>The fourth exception reſpects only the phraſe or manner of ſpeech uſed in that tranſlation, as not yielding a commodious ſenſe. I ſhall ſay no more but this to it; that when either man or beaſt drinks, he doth both draw out and draw in, he draweth the liquor out of the veſſel, and into his mouth.</p>

                        </gap>
                     </note>Fifthly, 'Tis ſaid, the word uſed by <hi>Job,</hi> ſignifies neither to <hi>educe or draw out,</hi> nor to <hi>induce or draw in,</hi> but to <hi>break forth,</hi> as appears (<hi>Job</hi> 38.8. <hi>Judg.</hi> 20.33. <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.2.) It doth ſo in thoſe three places now mentioned; yet all the Lexicographers which I have ſeen, render the Verb (<hi>educere</hi> as well as <hi>erum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pere</hi>) by a word ſignifying the force of another, drawing out a
<pb n="651" facs="tcp:48669:337"/> thing, as well as the breaking out of a thing by its own force. And ſo a Nowne ſubſtantive derived from this Verb is uſed (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.9.) which place we render thus, <hi>Thou art he that took</hi> (or <hi>dreweſt) me out of the womb.</hi> And though it be true, that Infants may be ſaid to break out of the womb, yet 'tis not by any power of their own, but by the power of God; and therefore it may much rather be ſaid, that God takes or draws them out of the womb, than that they break or make their way out.</p>
                  <p>Thus far of this tranſlation, as alſo of the grounds of that learned Authors diſſatisfaction with it. All which objections ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> the ſame in words, and fully the general ſcope and ſenſe. And I would adde this for the honour of our Tranſlators, that I am much per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded they did not render the Text thus, as perſons prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed with an opinion, that the Elephant muſt needs be intended here under the title <hi>Behemoth,</hi> but becauſe they then ſaw good ground for it in the Grammatical conſtruction and meaning of the Hebrew Text. What they would do now (were they living) up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the diſcovery which this worthy perſon hath lately made, I dare not ſay, but ſhall proceed to the explication of this verſe, as they have left it.</p>
                  <q>Behold he drinketh up a River.</q>
                  <p>The word which we tranſlate <hi>to drink up,</hi> ſignifies to rob,<note place="margin">Verbum <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> ſignificat ad ſe rapere per vim vel per frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem.</note> to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs; ſo ſome render it here, <hi>He robbeth a River,</hi> he ſteals a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all the water: that's a high ſtrain of Rhetorick to expreſs <hi>Behemoths</hi> great drought; he drinks, as if at a draught he meant to drink a River dry.</p>
                  <q>And [haſteth not.]</q>
                  <p>There is a twofold rendring of that: Firſt, thus; <hi>He drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a River that it haſteth not,</hi> referring this <hi>not haſting</hi> to the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and then the meaning is, He drinks ſo deep, that he even ſtops the current or courſe of the River. A River whoſe waters are either drawn away, or neer dryed, cannot run with wonted ſwiftneſs. This is another hyperbolical ſtrain, as if an Elephant were able to exhauſt a River. Great Armies have ſtopped the courſe of Rivers with drinking, they have drunk Rivers dry; in alluſion to which, it may be ſaid of the Elephant, <hi>He drinketh a
<pb n="652" facs="tcp:48669:338"/> River,</hi> that it haſteth not. So M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. <hi>Broughton</hi> reads it, <hi>Loe, he robs a River that it haſteth not.</hi> We tranſlate, <hi>He drinketh a River,</hi>
                     <q>And haſteth not.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>That is, the Elephant doth not haſt. This may have a twofold reference.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To his patience in thirſt. Though he drinks much when he comes to it,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Aelian. l. 14. c. 44.</hi> Clarae aquae potio Elephan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to inimiciſſima, turbulentam &amp; ſordidam ſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſſime bibit. <hi>Aelian. l. 14. c. 44.</hi>

                     </note> yet he can bear thirſt very patiently a long time. An ancient Writer affirms, the Elephant will live eight dayes without drinking; if ſo, he haſteth not to drink: though he drinks very much when he comes to it, yet he is not haſty to drink, he can forbear for eight dayes together.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, This may have reference (which I conceive moſt congruous) to his courage: <hi>He haſteth not;</hi> that is, he doth not drink in fear, he takes his leiſure. Hiſtorians ſay of the dog drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>Nilus,</hi> he doth but <hi>take a lap and away,</hi> he is afraid the Crocodile will come and catch him: And hence we ſpeak pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbially of thoſe who do but touch at a matter and leave it, <hi>They do like the dog at Nilus.</hi> This is a truth too, <hi>He drinketh up a River, and haſteth not.</hi> The Elephant is a ſtout, ſtrong creature, he fears no hurt, and therefore drinks as much as he will, and in as much time as he will.</p>
                  <p>Once more, ſome ſay, he haſteth not to drink, becauſe he ſpends ſome time to trouble and mud the water with his feet before he drinks; for he cannot abide (ſaith an ancient Author) to drink clear water: yea, ſome ſay, he therefore troubleth the water be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he drinketh, becauſe he cannot endure to ſee his own ſhape in the water; for which reaſon, 'tis alſo affirmed, that the <hi>Indians</hi> will not lead their Elephants by the waters at full Moon, but at new Moon only, when the air being darker, the water is to us leſs pellucid.</p>
                  <q>He truſteth that he can draw up <hi>Jordan</hi> into his mouth.</q>
                  <p>This is another high expreſſion, to ſhew the Elephants vaſt drinking. <hi>Jordan</hi> was a great River. The Elephant doth not only think that he can drink up a ſmall Brook or Rivulet, but a great Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, that he can draw up the River <hi>Jordan</hi> into his mouth. In the greatneſs of his thirſt, he doth ſo much ſlight any ſmall Brook or Pond, that he is confident, were he at the banks of <hi>Jordan,</hi> he could
<pb n="653" facs="tcp:48669:338"/> drink it dry. Thus, as before of his eating, he had whole moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to feed on; ſo here of his drinking, he draws a whole Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, <hi>Jordan, into his mouth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note, Firſt;
<q>That which is too much for many of ſome one kind, may be but enough for one of another kind.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>A little drink will ſerve a Dove. We ſay of a man who drinks ſparingly, <hi>He drinks like a Sparrow;</hi> and we may ſay of a great drinker, <hi>he drinkes not only like a Fiſh,</hi> or <hi>like a horſe</hi> (which are common ſayings) but <hi>like an Elephant.</hi>

                     </note> The Elephant drinks deep. Natural Hiſtorians report the meaſure of his drinking; he takes in the quantity of fourteen <hi>Macedonian</hi> Pitchers or Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards (how much they contain of our meaſure, I cannot ſay, but queſtionleſs they contain very much) for his mornings draught, and eight for his evenings draught.

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Note;
<q>If bruit creatures eat or drink much, it is from their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, not from their luſt.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Elephant drinks much, yet only what his nature and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, or the neceſſity of his nature, requires; he doth not drink thus in wantonneſs, or to ſatisfie a luſt; he drinks much, but he is no drunkard. There are three things in the Elephant which clear him, that his great drinking is not from his luſt, but need; Firſt, his natural conſtitution is very hot; that requires the more drink. Secondly, the climate wherein he is bred is very hot: the Elephant cannot well endure cold, and the heat of the Country makes him drink much. Thirdly, The greatneſs of his body; he hath a vaſt body, and that muſt needs require a great quantity of drink to fill it. The Elephants great drinking will not excuſe the drunkard, who drinks to exceſs; what he drinks, is but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſurate to the greatneſs of his body, and the neceſſities of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; 'tis not to ſerve a luſt, or to pleaſe his appetite. That which followeth, is the proſecution of the ſame thing.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His whole Chapter gives us a large diſcourſe, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the greateſt, the largeſt living creature that God made in this viſible world, <hi>the Leviathan.</hi> The whole Chapter may be divided into two general parts;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, A Narration.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, A Concluſion.</p>
                  <pb n="658" facs="tcp:48669:341"/>
                  <p>In the Narrative part, <hi>Leviathan</hi> is deſcribed four wayes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, By the bigneſs and vaſtneſs of his body, which is imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the firſt and ſecond verſes; he is a creature ſo big and bulky, that there is no holding him with a cord or line; he is too big, too boiſterous for an Angler to deal with. <hi>Canſt thou draw out Leviathan with an hook? or his tongue with a cord which thou let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt down?</hi> &amp;c. (<hi>verſ.</hi> 1, 2.)</p>
                  <p>Secondly, This Leviathan is deſcribed by the ſtoutneſs and untractableneſs of his ſpirit; there is no bringing him to any ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, to any ſervice or compliance. <hi>Will he make many ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations unto thee? will he ſpeak ſoft words unto thee? will he make a covenant with thee?</hi> &amp;c. (<hi>verſ.</hi> 3, 4, 5.)</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, He is deſcribed by the difficulty and danger, if not impoſſibility of taking or catching him; he will hardly be taken any way, no, not by the moſt forcible wayes, to make either meat or merchandize of him. <hi>Shall the companions make a banquet of him? ſhall they part him among the merchants? Canſt thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fiſh-ſpears?</hi> &amp;c. (<hi>verſ.</hi> 6, 7, 8, 9. and in the former part of the 10th verſe.) Thus far Leviathan is deſcribed in his greatneſs, in his ſtoutneſs, in the difficulty and danger of catching him, if he can be catched at all.</p>
                  <p>Now, the Lord having proceeded thus far in the deſcription of, or doctrine about Leviathan, he makes Uſe and Application of all that he had ſaid, before he comes to the fourth particular; and this Application or Uſe which the Holy Ghoſt makes of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription thus far given, conſiſts in two things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Hence the Lord infers his own irreſiſtibleneſs, and the utter inability of any creature to contend with him (in the cloſe of the 10th verſe) <hi>Who then is able to ſtand before me?</hi> If none can ſtand before this creature, can any ſtand before the Creator! That's the firſt Inference.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Lord makes a further Inference from it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his own ſelf-ſufficiency, or abſolute independency upon any creature, either for councel what to do, or for aſſiſtance in doing it. Thus much is clearly affirmed in that queſtion, at the beginning of the 11th verſe, <hi>Who hath prevented me, that I ſhould repay him.</hi> As if the Lord had ſaid, <hi>Let the man come forth that hath contributed any thing to me, in any of my works, or that hath
<pb n="659" facs="tcp:48669:341"/> given any help in the doing them, and he ſhall be well rewarded for his pains.</hi> Both theſe Inferences or Uſes, the Lord confirms by a <hi>grand Aſſertion</hi> or <hi>Maxime,</hi> in the cloſe of the 11th verſe; <hi>Whatſoever is under the whole Heaven, is mine. If all be mine, then who can ſtand before me? If all be mine, then who hath prevented me, that I ſhould repay him?</hi> This is the Application, theſe the Uſes, which the Lord himſelf makes of the doctrine laid down about this creature, the Leviathan: Theſe Uſes cloſe the third part of the deſcription of Leviathan. The fourth part of his deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, contains many particulars concerning his parts, power, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, as alſo the wonderful effects of his power, all which are ſet down in higheſt ſtrains of divine rhetorick, from the 11th verſe to the end of the 32.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond part of the Chapter I call the concluſion, and it flows naturally from the whole foregoing diſcourſe, in the two laſt verſes of it; <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon earth there is not his like</hi> (the Lord ſaid concerning <hi>Behemoth, He is the chief of the wayes of God,</hi> that is, <hi>upon earth;</hi> and here he ſaith of Leviathan, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon earth there is not his like,</hi> no, not <hi>Behemoth</hi> himſelf) <hi>he is made without fear, he beholdeth all high things, he is a King over all the children of pride.</hi> Thus far concerning the ſtate and parts of the whole Chapter, in which the Lord hath this general ſcope, even to humble <hi>Job</hi> yet more. As if he had ſaid, <hi>That thou, O</hi> Job, <hi>maiſt ſee and be convinced of thy preſumption in pleading with me; look upon Leviathan, conſider whether thou art able to deal with him; if not, how canſt thou deal with me who made him, and can both maſter and deſtroy him when I will?</hi> Thus the Lord makes his tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over creatures mightier in outward force than man, to the intent all men may know, they ſhall certainly fall, and be utterly confounded, if they lift up themſelves againſt God. All which will appear further, in opening the deſcription of this Levia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than.</p>

                  <p>And becauſe the Hebrew word for a Dragon is <hi>Thannin,</hi> ſome have conceived, that the laſt ſyllable in <hi>Leviathan</hi> is a contract of that, and added to <hi>Levijath,</hi> as implying, that in one Leviathan many Dragons were conjoyned. But I rather adhere to that learned Author, who takes Leviathan to be a ſimple, not a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound word, and ſaith, That the laſt ſyllable <hi>than,</hi> belongs to the form of the Nown,<note place="margin">Leviathan ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuoſum eſt animal &amp; in pluros ſpiras volubile. <hi>Bochart.</hi>
                     </note> as in <hi>Nehuſhtan,</hi> &amp;c. And he finds the root of the word Leviathan, neither in the Hebrew, nor in the <hi>Syriack,</hi> but in the <hi>Arabick</hi> language, where it ſignifies, to wind, plight or fold together, fitly intimating the crooked winding poſtures and motions of that animal called Leviathan.</p>
                  <p>But, what is this Leviathan?</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Moſt of the Ancients, both Greek and Latine, turn this Scripture wholly into an Allegory, expounding, as <hi>Behemoth</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſo here Leviathan, wholly of the old enemy of mankind, the Devil. 'Tis true, that many things here ſpoken of Leviathan, are applicable to the Devil; but to bring all to that ſenſe, is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs a forcing or ſtraining of the Text. Others, who proſecute the Allegory, apply it to bad Princes, who having great power, uſe it for the oppreſſion and vexation of thoſe that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their dominion. Nor can it be denyed, that the King of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> was intended by the Prophet, under the word <hi>Leviathan (Iſa.</hi> 27.1, 2.) as <hi>Pharoah</hi> King of <hi>Egypt</hi> is expreſly called <hi>Tannin,</hi> or) a Sea-Dragon, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 29.3. and Chap. 32.2.</p>

                     </note>Secondly, Several of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Writers expound Leviathan, not of any particular <hi>ſpecies,</hi> or ſort of fiſhes; but in general, of all great fiſhes.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The moſt general, and hitherto moſt received opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, concludes Leviathan to be among all fiſhes, the Whale in particular.</p>
                  <pb n="659" facs="tcp:48669:342"/>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Beza</hi> of the former age, and in this, <hi>Bochartus,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently aſſert, that Leviathan is the Crocodile. The general reaſon given for it by them, is, becauſe what is here ſpoken of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viathan, is not every way ſutable nor agreeable to the <hi>Whale;</hi> and they who expound Leviathan by the Whale, are as confident that ſeveral things here affirmed of Leviathan, are not agreeable to the Crocodile.</p>
                  <p>What my own apprehenſions are in this matter of difference, whether the Whale or the Crocodile be intended by Leviathan, I have already declared, at the fifteenth <hi>verſ.</hi> of the fortieth <hi>Chapter,</hi> where the Lord begins to preſent <hi>Behemoth,</hi> purpoſing alſo in the ſame continued ſpeech to preſent <hi>Leviathan</hi> to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of <hi>Job,</hi> in the livelieſt colours, and higheſt expreſſions of divine eloquence, for his yet fuller conviction and humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. There (I ſay) the Reader may find my thoughts about this matter; yet in opening the Text, I ſhall touch at moſt of thoſe particulars which the learned <hi>Bochartus</hi> takes notice of, either as more clearly, or as only applicable to the Crocodile; leaving the Reader (as was there ſaid) at his liberty to dete<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Thus alſo theſe two words are uſed (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.1.) where, <hi>Leviathan, the piercing</hi> (or <hi>croſſing the ſea like a bar) Serpent, even Leviathan the crooked Serpent, whom the Lord will pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh with his ſore, and great, and long ſword,</hi> as 'tis ſaid in the former part of the verſe, is the ſame with <hi>the dragon that is in the ſea, whom he will ſlay,</hi> as 'tis ſaid in the latter part of the verſe. Some of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Writers diſtinguiſh theſe two only in growth or greatneſs, defining <hi>Leviathan</hi> to be a great <hi>Thannin</hi> or Dragon. But as the word <hi>Thannin</hi> doth ſo ſignifie a Dragon, that yet it is often applied to ſignifie <hi>Whales and Sea-beaſts,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they in ſome ſort reſemble the form and flectuation of Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons; thus 'tis ſaid (<hi>Gen.</hi> 1.21.) that on the fifth day <hi>God created great</hi> (Thanninim) <hi>Whales.</hi> Now (I ſay) as in Scripture the word <hi>Thannin</hi> is rendred <hi>Whale,</hi> ſo Whales and ſuch like great fiſhes are in Scripture expreſſed by the word <hi>Leviathan.</hi> And in one place (poſſibly in more) nothing elſe can be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by the word <hi>Leviathan,</hi> but the Whale or fiſhes of the Cetacean or Whale kind.

                  </p>
                  <p>Further, to put a hook into the noſe, ſignifies theſe two things in Scripture. Firſt, To repreſs the rage or wrath of man. And Secondly, to divert or turn him aſide from his purpoſe (2 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.28. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 19.4.) And ſo in this place, the ſignificancy of the phraſe may be thus conceived, <hi>Canſt thou, O Job, abate the fury, or ſtop the courſe of Leviathan? Canſt thou put a hook into his noſe?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>Or bore his jaw thorow with a thorn?</q>
                  <p>And ſo carry him away with thee. Some underſtand it as an alluſion to the ringing of a Bear or Swine. Canſt thou over-power him, and boring his noſe, put a ring into it, as into the ſnout of a Swine or Bear, and ſo lead or carry him whither thou pleaſeſt, as a beaſt which thou haſt tamed and brought to hand?</p>
                  <p>Theſe two verſes have the ſame tendency, both ſetting forth the greatneſs of Leviathan, as to the weight and bulk of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. <hi>Canſt thou draw out Leviathan? canſt thou put an hook into his noſe?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Hence, Note;
<q>The Lord is to be admired and magnified in, and for the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and vaſtneſs of any Creature.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are two things about which the Lord is to be magnified in his creatures.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, In their qualities. There are ſome little, very little crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, in whoſe qualities the Lord is greatly to be magnified. The Piſmire, a poor little thing, little bigger than a pins-head, hath an admirable wit and fore-caſt. The Crane, the Turtle, the Swallow, are but ſmall creatures; yet they obſerve or underſtand their times, much better than many men, and are not only to be imitated by men in that quality, but to be admired for it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Other creatures are to be admired for their quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or bigneſs, and of this ſort Leviathan is chief. The reports of

Late Navigators, and they who make it their buſineſs to follow the Whale-fiſhing, have ſeen Whales of very vaſt dimenſions, and that ſometimes they endanger the overthrow of conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſhips; which argues their extraordinary ſtrength and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p>Heathens have ſaid, that though it cannot be denied, but there are many wonderful creatures to be ſeen upon the land, yet the ſea is the great ſtore-houſe of wonders: And we may give it in theſe three things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It is wonderful, that in the ſea there are ſuch various kinds of fiſhes. It is not imaginable how many ſorts of fiſh the ſea affords. I once heard a very learned Gentleman, and a great Traveller, ſay, that being abroad upon publick ſervice, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the Ambaſſador of another State at his table, the feaſt was wholly of fiſh, and the fiſh were only ſhell-fiſh variouſly cookt, every diſh having the ſhells laid about the verg of it, the fiſh being taken out; yet the Ambaſſador could not give a name to any one of them, having never ſeen their like in any part of the world where he had been. Now if a wiſe knowing man, alſo great a feaſt, could not give a name to any one ſhell-fiſh before him, what variety of kinds is there in the ſea, take all together!</p>
                  <p>Secondly, 'Tis wonderful to conſider, the huge multitude which is of every kind of fiſh in the ſea. The kinds are exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many, and there are innumerable of every kind.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That is wonderful, which I am now upon, the vaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the greatneſs of ſome kinds. Not only is Leviathan, but ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other fiſhes of the Sea, bigger than any beaſt upon the land. Let us conſider the greatneſs of the creatures, to lead us into the conſideration of the greatneſs of God. How great, how mighty is that God, who hath made ſuch great, ſuch mighty creatures!</p>
                  <pb n="665" facs="tcp:48669:345"/>
                  <p>Secondly, From theſe words, <hi>Canſt thou draw up Leviathan with a hook?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note;
<q>Great things cannot be done ordinarily with ſmall means.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>A hook and a line may ſerve the turn, to draw up any ſmall and ſome great fiſhes, but they will not ſerve turn to draw up a Levia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than. There muſt be a proportion between the inſtrument and the work, elſe nothing can be done in a natural way. As we need not call for a beetle to kill a fly; we may do that with a touch of the finger: in which ſenſe <hi>David</hi> ſpake (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.14.) <hi>Againſt whom is the King of Iſrael come forth? againſt a dead dog or a flea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> As if he had ſaid, I wonder thou ſhould'ſt raiſe an army againſt me, who have ſo little ſtrength, and intend thee no hurt, had I ſtrength (as I have had opportunity) to do it. Now (I ſay) as we need not uſe great means to effect little things, ſo we muſt uſe great means to do great things, and we ſhould uſe means propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable for the doing of every thing. You cannot batter down a ſtone wall, or a ſtrong tower with paper-ſhot, nor with a pot-gun, no, you muſt plant cannon for that ſervice.</p>
                  <p>Again, when this Scripture ſaith, <hi>Canſt thou draw out Levia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than?</hi> The emphaſis (as was ſhewed before in opening the words) lieth in the word <hi>thou.</hi> As if the Lord had ſaid, <hi>thou canst not, but I can.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence, note;
<q>The Lord is able to do the greateſt things by ſmalleſt means.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Leviathan to God is but as any little fiſh to us, which is taken with a hook and line. To take up Leviathan, to do the greateſt thing, is as eaſie to God, as the leaſt to man. As the power of God ſupplyeth all the weakneſs of the creature to do any thing, ſo it ſurpaſſeth all that ſtrength and greatneſs of the creature, which may ſeem to hinder him from doing any thing with it or upon it. <hi>He</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.21.) <hi>ſhall change our vile body, that it may be faſhioned like unto his glorious body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> (how ſhall he do this?) <hi>according to the working of his mighty power, whereby he is able to ſubdue all things to himſelf.</hi> The Lord can, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, ſubdue Leviathan to himſelf by the working of that mighty power, which ſubdueth all things to himſelf. And it is much
<pb n="666" facs="tcp:48669:346"/> more eaſie for Chriſt to ſubdue any Leviathan, than to change our vile body into the likeneſs of his own glorious body. For, as <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt was</hi> (once) <hi>declared to be the Son of God with power, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſpirit of holineſs, by the reſurrection</hi> (that is, his own reſurrection) <hi>from the dead;</hi> ſo he will again declare himſelf to be the Son of God with power, according to the ſpirit of power, by our reſurrection from the dead. He that can draw our duſt out of the grave with a word, can ſoon draw Leviathan out of the deepeſt gulf in the Sea by his hook and cord.</p>
                  <p>This may comfort thoſe, and ſtrengthen their faith, who at any time ſee Leviathans ready to ſwallow them up, as the Whale did <hi>Jonah.</hi> As the Lord prepared that great fiſh to ſwallow up <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah (Jonah</hi> 1.17.) ſo he commanded that great fiſh to deliver him back ſafe again; or, as that Scripture ſaith, (Chap. 2.10.) <hi>He ſpake to the fiſh, and he vomited out</hi> Jonah <hi>upon the dry land.</hi> Both were acts of great power, and teach us, that the Lord hath a ſoveraign commanding power over all, even the greateſt creatures.</p>
                  <p>The Lord hath a hook for Leviathan. He had hooks for <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh, The great Dragon in the midſt of his Rivers (Ezek.</hi> 29.3, 4.) And of him the Lord commanded the ſame Prophet to ſpeak in a like notion (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 32.2.) <hi>Son of man, take up a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation for</hi> Pharaoh, <hi>and ſay to him, thou art like a young Lion of the Nations, and thou art as a Whale in the Seas, and thou cameſt forth with thy Rivers, and troubledſt the waters with thy feet, and fouledst their Rivers; therefore I will ſpread out my net over thee, and they ſhall bring thee up in my net.</hi> I have a net for thee, ſaith this Chapter; I have hooks for thee, ſaith that other. The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> to engage the Lord to do ſome great thing for his Church, minded him of what he had formerly and anciently done for <hi>Iſrael (Iſa.</hi> 51.9.) <hi>Awake, awake, put on ſtrength, O arm of the Lord, awake as in the ancient dayes, as in the generations of old; art thou not it that hath cut</hi> Rahab, <hi>and wounded the Dragon?</hi> This <hi>Rahab</hi> was <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the Dragon was <hi>Pharoah,</hi> as Interpreters generally agree. The Pſalmiſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports the dealings of God with <hi>Pharoah</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> in language nearer that of the Text (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 74.13, 14.) <hi>Thou breakeſt the heads of the Dragons in the waters, thou breakeſt the heads of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viathan in pieces, and gaveſt him to be meat to the people inhabiting the wilderneſs;</hi> that is, the remembrance of that mercy, and of
<pb n="667" facs="tcp:48669:346"/> the mighty power of God in deſtroying <hi>Pharoah</hi> and his <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> Hoſt, who purſued them after their departure from <hi>Egypt,</hi> to the red Sea, was to be food for their faith in all the dangers and hardſhips w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> they were like to meet with in their travels, through the howling wilderneſs to the Land of <hi>promiſe.</hi> Take one Scripture-inſtance more (2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 19.28.) <hi>Sennacherib</hi> was a Leviathan, he came up againſt <hi>Hezekiah</hi> to deſtroy him and his people, which provok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Lord to ſpeak thus of him, <hi>Becauſe thy rage againſt me is come into my ears, therefore I will put my hook into thy noſe, and my bridle in thy lips, and turn thee back by the way thou cameſt.</hi> Thus far of the firſt thing in the deſcription of Leviathan, his greatneſs.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond part of his deſcription, ſheweth the ſtoutneſs and ſtubbornneſs of his ſpirit, he will not comply, he will not yield, he will not any way ſubmit. This is laid down in the 3d, 4th, and 5th verſes.</p>
                  <q>
                     <bibl>
                        <hi>Verſ. 3.</hi>
                     </bibl> Will he make many ſupplications to thee?</q>
                  <p>The word in the Hebrew, properly ſignifies <hi>deprecation,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Precamur bona deprecamur tantum mala.</note> which is prayer for the turning away of evil; when evil is near, then we deprecate it. Will he do this? not he: He will not petition thee, he ſcorns to petition thee, or to cry for quarter.</p>
                  <p>But, it may be ſaid, can fiſhes pray or make ſupplications? to do ſo, is at leaſt the work of rational creatures. I anſwer,<note place="margin">Per Proſopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poeian tribuit ei orationem.</note> theſe words are to be underſtood by that figure <hi>Proſopopoeia,</hi> frequently uſed in Scripture, when acts of Reaſon are attributed to irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, yea, to ſenſeleſs and lifeleſs creatures. The very hills and valleys, the Seas and waters praiſe God by a figure; and here by a like figure, Leviathan will not make ſupplications unto man; which ſhews the ſtoutneſs of his ſpirit. As ſome priſoners taken in war, ſcorn to ask their lives; ſo if Leviathan were taken with a hook, he would make no ſupplications, nor beg your favour, ſo ſtout is he; his heart is too great, his ſtomack too big for any kind of ſubmiſſion. <hi>Will he make many ſupplications unto thee?</hi> no, he will make none at all. This is further expreſſed in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of the verſe.</p>

When the <hi>Gibeonites (Joſh.</hi> 9.9.) were afraid they ſhould be taken and deſtroyed, they came and begged peace, they ſpake <hi>ſoft words.</hi> There are words of two ſorts.</p>
                  <pb n="668" facs="tcp:48669:347"/>
                  <p>Some are very hard words; and hard words wound like hard blows. And (though no blows are given) <hi>The Lord will come to execute judgement upon the ungodly, for all their hard ſpeeches, (Jude, verſ.</hi> 15.) Many ſpeak words as hard as ſtones, they throw hard words at the heads and about the ears of others, hard words of threatning, and hard words of reviling; for theſe the Lord will judge the ungodly, as well as for their <hi>ungodly deeds.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, as there are hard words, ſo ſoft words. What are they? Soft words are words of intreaty, words of meekneſs, words of love, words of ſubmiſſion; theſe are ſoft words. Will Levia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than make ſupplications? or, <hi>Will he ſpeak ſoft words?</hi> Again, ſoft words are often flattering words, which are therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared by the Prophet (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 13.18.) <hi>To pillows ſowed under the arm-holes.</hi> Will Leviathan flatter himſelf into thy favour? will he lie down like a Spaniel, and fawn upon thee? no, he is too high-ſpirited to bow, too ſtiff to ſtoop, he will ſpeak no ſoft words. <hi>A ſoft anſwer</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 15.1.) <hi>turneth away ſtrife.</hi> 'Tis good when a queſtion is put to us, to give a ſoft an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>: And if when we have hard words ſpoken to us, we return hard anſwers, they will quickly ſtir up ſtrife. <hi>Solomon</hi> hath a ſtrange expreſſion (<hi>Prov.</hi> 15.15.) <hi>A ſoft tongue breaketh the bones.</hi> The tongue naturally, is a ſoft, fleſhy, ſpungy member of the body; yet there is nothing hath more hardneſs, I may ſay more bones in it than the tongue; but 'tis the ſoft tongue which breaketh the bones, not the bones of the body, but of the mind: and the meaning is this, If the ſpirit of a man be as ſtiff as the bones of his body againſt you, yet if you ſpeak ſoft words, you may break him, and bring him to your deſire; whereas, if you be high and ſtiff, if you give hard for hard, it turns to an exaſperation. <hi>It were no great loſs, if they could ſpeak no more than Leviathan, who like Leviathan, know not how to ſpeak ſoft words.</hi> And uſually, they who are freeſt to ſpeak ſoft words of flattery, are furtheſt from ſpeaking ſoft words of love or charity, of gentleneſs and true ingenuity. 'Tis good, and our wiſdom in two caſes, to ſpeak ſoft words in truth, even to thoſe who are none of the beſt.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To avoid hard dealing, from thoſe who have us in their power: and they who are afraid of hard dealing, will ſure enough ſpeak ſoft words; whereas a man that cares not how hardly others deal with him, cares not to ſpeak ſoft words.</p>
                  <pb n="669" facs="tcp:48669:347"/>
                  <p>Secondly, 'Tis wiſdom to ſpeak ſoft words, when we are in expectation or under hope of receiving benefit or good from any,<note place="margin">Loqui mollia inferioris eſt.</note> in the power of whoſe hand it is to do us good. They have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to give good words, who would receive any good. Thus ſome ſpeak ſoft words to divert evil, others ſpeak ſoft words that they may obtain good. As for Leviathan, he is here repreſented in the pride of his heart, as neither fearing any hurt you can do him, nor deſiring you ſhould do him any good; and therefore, <hi>Will he ſpeak ſoft words to thee?</hi> no, not he.</p>
                  <p>Hence obſerve;
<q>The ſtrong and mighty will not make ſupplications, nor uſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>They who think they have enough in themſelves, will not make ſupplication to God himſelf, they will not entreat his favour, nor ſpeak ſoft words to him. There are many ſuch proud ſtout-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Leviathans in the likeneſs of men (<hi>Jer.</hi> 10.25.) <hi>Pour out thy wrath upon the families that call not upon thy name.</hi> There are whole families that will not make ſupplications to God. What are theſe? a company of Leviathans, that think they have enough of their own, and live in a ſelf-ſtrength, or in a ſelf-ſufficiency, as if they were not beholding to God for any thing they have, nor deſired to have any thing of him. The Lord ſpeaks of a generation of men, who <hi>ſhame the counſel of the poor, becauſe the Lord is his refuge (Pſal.</hi> 14.6.) that is, becauſe they in all their wants, dangers and diſtreſſes, had recourſe to God by prayer, as their only refuge. Of what ſpirit thoſe men were, who ſhamed or were aſhamed of this counſel and courſe of the poor, he tells us at the 4th verſe of that <hi>Pſalm; They eat up my people as they eat bread, and call not upon God.</hi> We (thought they) have enough of our own, ſtrength enough of our own, we are Leviathans, we need not be beholding to God. It is an argument of a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſtout, high mind, not to make ſupplications (<hi>Prov.</hi> 18.23.) <hi>The poor uſeth entreaties,</hi> or, <hi>the poor ſpeaketh ſupplications.</hi> They that are poor in outward things, will ſpeak very humbly to thoſe above them; and if we know our own ſpiritual poverty, that we are weak, empty creatures, even nothing-creatures, if we are poor in ſpirit, we will be uſing many entreaties to get in with God, and to move him to have mercy upon us. None but hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="670" facs="tcp:48669:348"/> ones, and ſuch as ſee their wants and dangers, that they are hardly beſtead in this world, or are convinced that all the good and great things they have, yea, that the greateſt things they can have in this world, can ſtand them in no ſtead without God, will ſpeak ſoft words of ſupplication unto God. Leviathan never thinks himſelf in danger or in want, and therefore he ſcorns all the world; and in this he is an emblem of all carnal worldly men. And as Leviathan will make no ſupplications, nor ſpeak ſoft words, ſo
<q>
                        <bibl>
                           <hi>Verſ. 4.</hi>
                        </bibl> Will he make a Covenant with thee?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some who think themſelves too high to make ſupplications to others, may yet poſſibly make a covenant with them. But, <hi>Will Leviathan make a covenant with thee?</hi> he will not. The word which we tranſlate a <hi>Covenant,</hi> ſignifies two things. Firſt, <hi>to chuſe,</hi> becauſe a Covenant is to be made by choice perſons, and upon choice tearms.<note place="margin">An ſcindet vel ſecabit? <hi>Heb.</hi> foedus factum erat, adhibita ſectione vituli.</note> Secondly, it ſignifies <hi>to eat,</hi> becauſe they were wont to feaſt when covenants were made. The Hebrew is, <hi>Will he ſtrike or cut a covenant with thee.</hi> The reaſon of that, was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were wont to divide a beaſt, and paſs between the parts of it at the making of a Covenant (<hi>Jer.</hi> 34.18.) <hi>They did cut the calf in twain, and paſſed between the parts thereof. Will Leviathan cut a Covenant with thee?</hi> As he will not ſpeak thee fair, nor endeavour to ſoften thy heart towards him, by ſpeaking ſoft words to thee, were he in thy power, ſo he will never enter covenant with thee, to become thy ſure friend, much leſs thy faithful ſervant; as it followeth in the Text.</p>
                  <q>Wilt thou take him for thy ſervant for ever?</q>
                  <p>Many are Covenant-ſervants for a time, ſome for ever. Theſe four things follow in order. Firſt, Some for fear make ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Secondly, They ſpeak ſoft words. Thirdly, They makes covenant or promiſe. Fourthly, They offer their ſervice to thoſe in whoſe hand they are. But Leviathan will do none of theſe, from firſt to laſt. <hi>Wilt thou take him for thy ſervant for ever?</hi> If thou wilt, he will not. Suppoſe thou hadſt taken Leviathan with a hook, and hadſt him faſt in thy power with a cord, will he be thy ſervant as long as he lives? King <hi>Benhadad</hi> being taken in war, ſent to King <hi>Ahab,</hi> and ſubmitted to him as a ſervant, that he
<pb n="671" facs="tcp:48669:348"/> might have his life (1 <hi>Kings</hi> 20.32.)<note place="margin">Qui jure belli occidi potuit, non duram ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem, ſi paratam mortem cum longa ſervitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te commutat. <hi>Sanct.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Thy ſervant</hi> Benhadad <hi>ſaith, I pray thee let me live.</hi> But this Leviathan is ſo ſtout, that he will not ask his life of any man, nor will he ſerve any for an hour, much leſs for ever.</p>
                  <q>Will he make a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him for thy ſervant for ever?</q>
                  <p>That is, will he become thy ſervant by covenant, or thy cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-ſervant? Covenants bind ſervants to duty. There are two things in a ſervants covenant. Firſt, it obligeth him to work. Secondly, it aſſureth him of a reward. Gods covenant with us aſſures us of mercy, <hi>I will be to you a God,</hi> I will pardon your ſins, I will do you good; and then it requires duty, <hi>You ſhall be to me a people,</hi> you ſhall walk humbly and uprightly before me, you ſhall ſerve me for ever. <hi>Wilt thou take Leviathan to ſerve thee</hi>
                     <q>For ever?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But are any ſervants, or ſhall any (except God himſelf) be ſerved, for ever? why then ſaith the Lord, <hi>Wilt thou take him for thy ſervant for ever?</hi> Some are taken ſervants only for a year, ſome for ſeven years, others for life. They who are ſervants for life, are and may be called our ſervants <hi>for ever:</hi> ſo that when the Lord ſaith, <hi>Wilt thou take him for thy ſervant for ever?</hi> the meaning is, will he be thy ſervant as long as he liveth? And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the life of a beaſt may well be called his <hi>for ever;</hi> foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as he hath no life after this life, nor being after death. The word rendred <hi>for ever,</hi> comes from a root in the Hebrew, which ſignifieth to hide, or to be hidden, becauſe Eternity, which is <hi>for ever</hi> in ſtrict ſenſe, is altogether hidden and without end: and if <hi>for ever</hi> be taken only for a long time, indefinitely, that's a hidden thing too; who knows when a long time will end, if no end be aſſigned to it? The life of man is his <hi>for ever</hi> in this world; for how ſhort ſoever it is, no man knows the end of it, and ſo to him it is a hidden thing. In this ſenſe alſo the life of a beaſt is a hidden thing as to the natural end of it, and ſo his <hi>for ever. Wilt thou take him to be thy ſervant for ever?</hi> or, <hi>Will he be thy ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting ſervant?</hi>

                  <p>Hence note;
<q>All the creatures were made for mans ſervice, and were once his ſervants.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore when creatures will not ſerve us, eſpecially when they riſe againſt us, we ſhould remember, as our fall in <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo our own failings in the ſervice of God. The unſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceableneſs of the creature to us, is a fruit and an effect of our unſerviceableneſs and diſobedience to God. That word of God (<hi>Gen.</hi> 1.28.) which I may call the charter of mans Lordſhip o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the creature, reached Leviathan himſelf; <hi>And God bleſſed them, and God ſaid, be fruitful, and multiply and repleniſh the earth, and ſubdue it, and have dominion over the fiſh of the Sea,</hi> &amp;c. that includes dominion over the Leviathan. The Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> alſo (Chap. 3.7.) ſpeaks of mans dominion over the fiſh of the Sea, <hi>Every kind of beaſts, and of birds, and of ſerpents, and of things in the Sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind.</hi> Man was originally inveſted with a power, to tame, not only things on earth, but things in the Sea, even the mighty Leviathan. And when the Lord after the flood reſtored the world, and renewed mans charter, he put in this among the reſt of his grants, the ſubjection of the fiſh of the Sea (<hi>Gen.</hi> 9.1, 2.) <hi>And God bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed</hi> Noah <hi>and his ſons, and ſaid, be fruitful and multiply, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſh the earth; and the fear of you, and the dread of you ſhall be upon every beaſt of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, and upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fiſhes of the Sea; into your hand they are delivered:</hi> The very fiſh of the Sea ſhall fear and reverence you.

And as he is not for mans work, ſo not for his ſport.</p>

                     </bibl> Wilt thou play with him as with a bird? wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?</q>
                  <p>Or, as Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi> renders this latter clauſe, <hi>Wilt thou tye him for thy young girles?</hi> This verſe holds out a further evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the ſtoutneſs of Leviathan. Some creatures, though they will not work, yet they will play and make you ſport; but Leviathan is ſo ſtout, that he will neither do you any work, nor make you any ſport.</p>
                  <q>Wilt thou play with him as with a bird?</q>
                  <p>The word ſignifies any ſmall bird, eſpecially a Sparrow, with which children uſe to play. Leviathan will not play with man; nor is he to be made a play, or to be ſported with. When the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> had put out <hi>Sampſons</hi> eyes (who was once as terrible to them as a Leviathan) they called for him <hi>to make them ſport;</hi> and the Text ſaith (<hi>Judg.</hi> 16.25.) <hi>He made them ſport,</hi> though they quickly found he was not a man to be ſported with. We ſay proverbially, <hi>'Tis ill jeſting with edge-tools;</hi> I may ſay, <hi>'Tis ill ſporting with Leviathan.</hi> The vulgar Latine tranſlation ſaith,<note place="margin">Numquid illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des ei ficut avi. <hi>Vulg.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Wilt thou cozen or enſnare him as a bird?</hi> Canſt thou entangle him as a little bird with lime-twigs? or entice him into thy net, and then make ſport with him? Leviathan is a great player, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry game-ſome; but he will not play at any game with us, nor can we play at any game with him, but <hi>Hazzard.</hi> That he is very gameſom when and where he pleaſeth, the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> tells us, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the great and wide Sea (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.26.) <hi>There go the Ships, there is that Leviathan, whom thou haſt made to play therein.</hi> He is made for play, not for work; but where doth he play? Levia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than will play in the Sea, but he will not play at Land. <hi>Wilt thou play with him as with a bird?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <pb n="674" facs="tcp:48669:350"/>Wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?</q>
                  <p>Or for thy maid-ſervants? or for thy litle maiden daughters? Young maidens or girles delight in birds, and if they get one tyed by a ſtring, they play with it. Thus we ſee Leviathan will have no dealing with us, neither in earneſt nor in jeſt, neither at work nor play, he will neither ſerve us, nor ſport with us. <hi>Wilt thou play with him?</hi> &amp;c. Some creatures are made for play, for ſport, others for work and ſervice; yet here is one (and there are more of that temper) ſo fierce, ſo ſtout, that he will be brought to neither; he will not ſerve you, as 'tis ſaid in the former verſe; he will not play with you, nor dare you play with him. In this latter verſe, Leviathan is ſomewhat like that untoward and froward generation, of whom Chriſt ſpake (<hi>Mat.</hi> 11.16.) <hi>To whom ſhall I liken this generation? they are like to children fitting in the market-place, and calling unto their fellows, &amp; ſaying, we have piped unto you, &amp; ye have not danced; we have mourned unto you, and ye have not lamented.</hi> So we may ſay of this Leviathan, if you mourn to him, he will not lament; if you pipe to him, he will not dance. A proud untractable ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit will not comply nor bow either way; he will neither weep nor rejoyce with you, faſt nor feaſt with you, work nor play with you.</p>
                  <p>Thus we have had the deſcription of Leviathan; Firſt, by the greatneſs of his body (<hi>verſ.</hi> 1, 2.) Secondly, by the ſtoutneſs of his ſpirit (<hi>verſ.</hi> 3, 4, 5.) The five verſes following, ſhew the great difficulty or extream danger of taking, or of catching him, which is the third part of his deſcription.</p>

Or, Secondly, Shall they rejoyce and make merry, becauſe they have catcht Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viathan, and gotten ſuch a prize. Underſtanding the words in this latter ſenſe, Leviathan being caught, is the occaſion, not the matter of the banquet. As if it had been ſaid, <hi>Fiſher-men, or their ſocieties, ſhall never have cauſe to rejoyce and triumph at the captivity of Leviathan, nor ſay they, have gotten him into their hands or cuſtody, to lade their veſſels, and fill their ware-houſes,</hi> to vend him out again, and fill their purſes, as it followeth in this verſe.</p>
                  <q>Shall they part him among the Merchants?</q>

                  </p>
                  <p>The Text ſeems to ſay; If they could but get Leviathan into their hands, what feaſting would there be, or there would be great feaſting! He that by diligent ſearch finds that bleſſed trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the field, of which Chriſt ſpake in the Parable (<hi>Mat.</hi> 13.44.) <hi>he</hi> (I ſay) <hi>for joy of it, ſells all that he hath and buyeth that field.</hi> And as they, who have found Chriſt, that treaſure, have cauſe to rejoyce with great joy: So when any good is found, or gained by hard labour, 'tis matter of joy.</p>
                  <p>But is banqueting and feaſting all that Fiſher-men aime at, when they labour and venture ſo hard to catch Leviathan? ſurely no, they aime at profit more than at pleaſure, it is to ſell off what they get to the Merchants.</p>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>Profit puts men upon hard and perilous labours.</q>

                  <q>Shall they part him among the Merchants?</q>
                  <p>Hence we may note;
<q>Merchandiſe is of very antient uſe.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Merchants have been of old buying and ſelling, conveighing by Land, tranſporting by ſea, the commodities of one country to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; as it turns to the riches, ſo to the honour, and manifold ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of mankind. Only let Merchants be wiſe to trade hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven-ward, as well as earth-ward; and be careful they make not ſhipwrack of a good conſcience, while their ſhips and goods eſcape it. Let them often remember the Apoſtles admonition (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.29, 30.) <hi>The time is ſhort; let them that buy, be as if they poſſeſſed not; and they that uſe this world, as not abuſing it; for the faſhion of this world paſſeth away.</hi> Be not unwiſe Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, ſuch as mind not the <hi>true treaſure,</hi> the <hi>right pearl</hi> of price.</p>
                  <p>The Lord having in this ſixth verſe intimated, how hard a task, and how hazardous it is to take Leviathan, ſpeaks it expreſsly in the next.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Barbed irons and fiſh-ſpears</hi> are inſtruments in uſe at this day for the taking of Whales, and ſuch like Sea-monſters. Now, ſaith the Lord, though thou canſt not draw up Leviathan with hook and line, yet poſſibly thou thinkeſt, he may be conquered with barbed Irons and ſpears. The word here rendred <hi>barbed Irons</hi> ſignifies <hi>thorns,</hi> becauſe ſuch irons are ſharp like thornes. The skin of a well-grown Whale is extream tough, and not eaſily penetrated; ſo that the Lord might well ſay, <hi>Canſt thou fill his skin with bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed Irons? or his head with fiſh-ſpears?</hi> Yet, I conceive, theſe queſtions do not import an utter impoſſibility, but the extream difficulty of taking the Leviathan, what animal ſoever it is. The learned <hi>Bochartus</hi> takes theſe words, as much favouring his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion for the Crocodile; <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>they who write about the manner of catching the Whale, teſtifie that he is overcome with
<pb n="677" facs="tcp:48669:351"/> ſhowers of barbed Irons, caſt or poured upon him by the Sea-men that compaſſe him about; but as for the Crocodile, his skin is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together impenitrable.</hi> But I ſhall defer any further diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe about this point, which is the chief proof againſt the Whale, till I come to the 15th verſe, and thoſe which follow, in a deſcription of the ſcales of Leviathan. And from the preſent words, <hi>Canſt thou fill his skin with barbed Irons?</hi> &amp;c. I ſhall only</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>As becauſe it is a hard thing for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven, Chriſt ſaith, <hi>'tis eaſier for a Camel to paſs through a needles eye:</hi> At which word, his Diſciples being amazed, cryed out, <hi>Who then can be ſaved?</hi> Thus the Prophet ſpake, to ſhew the extream difficulty of reclaiming an accuſtomed ſinner (<hi>Jer.</hi> 13.23.) <hi>Can the Ethiopian change his skin? then may he that is accuſtomed to do evil, learn to do good.</hi> It is not altogether impoſſible for one that is accuſtomed to do evil to learn to do good (through the grace of God he may repent) but, becauſe it is a very difficult thing, therefore the Scripture ſpeaks of it as if it were an impoſſible thing, even as impoſſible as for an <hi>Ethiopian</hi> to change his hue, or the blackneſs of his skin, which no labour, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a miracle can do.</p>
                  <p>The difficulty of dealing with this Leviathan, is yet more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expreſſed in the next words.</p>

                  <p>Thoſe words, <hi>lay thy hand upon him,</hi> may be taken three ways.<note place="margin">Demulce eum &amp; experire utrum ea potiti poteris. <hi>Jun.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, Lay thy hand upon him gently, or to ſtroke him. As if it had been ſaid ſaid. When thou canſt not take him by force with barbed Irons and fiſh-ſpears, then lay thy hand upon him tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and friendly, try thy utmoſt skill (as before thy utmoſt ſtrength) whether thou canſt take him by fair means, by ſoothing or tickling him (as ſome fiſhes are taken) about the gills.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, (To which interpretation I rather adhere, than to the former. (This conceſſion, <hi>lay thine hand on him,</hi> carrieth a ſenſe
<pb n="678" facs="tcp:48669:352"/> of hoſtility; as if it had been ſaid, as we often ſay in ſuch caſes, <hi>Touch him if thou dareſt; thou hadst as good have let him alone, thou hadst as good eat thy nails as meddle with him;</hi> uſe the leaſt violence to him at thy peril be it, he will quickly make thee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent thy raſhneſs, and thou wilt have little mind to fight it out with him.</p>

The clear ſenſe of the whole, to me, is this: <hi>If thou put thine hand upon him, if thou meddlest to take him either by force or craft, if thou doſt ingage any way with him, thou wilt be forc'd to remember the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, thou wilt find thou haſt cauſe to remember it as long as thou liveſt; if thou layeſt, or ſhalt lay thy hand upon him, thou wilt think of the battle, that thou haſt made a raſh adventure, nor wilt thou venture ſo again, thy own harms will make thee wiſer, and thy ſad experience (the Miſtreſs of fools) will teach thee to take heed.</hi> Now according to this reading, and the ſenſe given of it, the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative is put for the Future, which (as the Learned tell us) is uſual in Scripture, and the conditional term <hi>If</hi> is underſtood and placed at the beginning of the ſentence, which is familiar in the Hebrew tongue: And ſo inſtead of, <hi>lay thy hand on him,</hi> &amp;c. (as we render) the words run thus, <hi>If thou ſhalt lay thy hand on
<pb n="679" facs="tcp:48669:352"/> him, thou wilt remember the battle, and do no more.</hi> This is a clear ſenſe, and ſo likewiſe is that other, which bids him do it at his peril; <hi>lay thine hand upon him if thou wilt, adventure to take him if thou darest; but remember the battle, conſider what will come of it, and do no more I adviſe thee.</hi> Thus it ſeems to be ſuch a conceſſion as <hi>Solomon</hi> gives the young man (<hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 11.9.) <hi>Rejoyce O young man in thy youth, and let thy heart chear thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thy own heart, and in the ſight of thine eyes; but</hi> (what follows?) <hi>know, for all theſe things God will bring thee to judgment.</hi> So here the Lord ſeems to ſay, <hi>Go, lay thy hand on him, go, take Leviathan if thou canſt; but remember the battle, remember Leviathan is a terrible crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and therefore I adviſe thee to do no more,</hi> or to have no more to do with him, venture no further, he is a perillous beaſt.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Lord might ſay to <hi>Job;</hi> Thou haſt been very buſie to call for an account from me, and to be dealing with me; but art thou able to deal with Leviathan? conſider then how thou canſt deal with me; therefore ſit down quietly, take heed of the leaſt thought that my ways towards thee want the leaſt grain of juſtice, or that they are wanting of mercy and loving kindneſs; contend no longer, ſtrive no more with me, who have more ſtrength than ten thouſand Leviathans; and with whom to contend, 'tis ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times more dangerous, than with Leviathan. <hi>Remember the battle, do no more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>It is good to remember the iſſues of actions before we act.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lay thy hand upon him; but conſider what will come of it, what it may coſt thee: As in that great buſineſs of our receiving Chriſt in the Goſpel, <hi>put your hand to the plow,</hi> put your hand to the profeſſion of the Goſpel; but pray remember the battle: you may come to a great battle, you may have to deal with proud Leviathans, before you have made good your good profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. This was Chriſts councel (<hi>Luk.</hi> 14.28, 33.) to all his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>Which of you intending to build a Tower, ſitteth not down firſt, and counteth the coſt?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Or what King going to make war with another King, ſitteth not down firſt, and conſulteth?</hi> &amp;c. whether he can maintain the war, he remembers the battle; ſo, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The believing Jews (<hi>Heb.</hi> 10.34.) <hi>endured a groat fight of affliction after they were illuminated,</hi> and had received the Lord Jeſus
<pb n="680" facs="tcp:48669:353"/> Chriſt. There are two things which we ſhould be very much in remembering. Firſt, Our duty (<hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.1.) <hi>Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth.</hi> Secondly, Our danger; or, take both together, what danger duty may engage us in; elſe when danger comes we ſhall ſoon forſake our duty. Many take up a profeſſion of Chriſt, who never thought of the danger, of the tryals, afflictions and temptations, which might befall them for his ſake; they remembred not the battle, and ſo have either preſently been overcome and fallen in it, or have unworthily forſaken their colours, and run from it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Note;
<q>It is beſt not to do, or forbear to do that which we cannot but ſee (if we have our eyes in our heads) will be dangerous to us in the doing.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>We are not always to forbear the doing of thoſe things that will be dangerous to our outward man (for ſo the beſt things may be) but thoſe things that will be dangerous to our bodies and ſouls too, we muſt always for bear to do; in all ſuch caſes it is our duty to remember the battle, and do no more. Will any wiſe man engage in danger which can produce no profit? There are ſome things which we are to do, and do again, though our dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger be never ſo great, yea, though we loſe our lives in doing them: But there are many things we may not do if we fore-ſee danger. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul (Acts</hi> 27.9, 10.) being at ſea, ſaid <hi>I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not only to the lading of the ſhip, but to our lives alſo;</hi> therefore he tells them (<hi>ver.</hi> 21.) <hi>Sirs, ye ſhould have harkened to me, and not have looſed from</hi> Crete, <hi>and to have gained this harm and loſs;</hi> that had been their wiſdom, when they were warned of the danger, not to have gone on. When there is danger to our bodies only, and we ſee no benefit that may countervail the danger, 'tis folly to proceed. I may urge this point ſpecially in caſe of ſin: Take heed of doing any thing that is evil; remember the battle that ſin will bring you to. Sin will bring you to a terrible battle, to ſuch a battle as no man can ſtand in or eſcape. Sin brings to a battle infinitely more dangerous than that with Leviathan. Sin pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes God to battle; and when God is angry, we may more ſafely contend with ten thouſand Leviathans, than with him. When you
<pb n="681" facs="tcp:48669:353"/> are tempted to put your hand to ſin, O remember the battle, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the battle. Thou (poſſibly) wilt have a ſore battle in thy own conſcience, and that's a dreadful Leviathan; but that's not all, remember the battle with God, who is greater than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; you muſt come to judgment, remember the battle of that day, or that day of Battle, with impenitent and hardned ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and ſin no more; give it over, as you love your lives, as you love your precious ſouls, and the everlaſting peace or welfare of them. You cannot ſin without a great deal of danger, even the danger of eternal wrath and death.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have touched at ſome things from this third part of the deſcription of Leviathan. He hath hitherto been ſet before us: Firſt, In the huge bulk and bigneſs of his body. Secondly, In the ſtoutneſs of his ſpirit; he will neither make ſupplications, nor enter covenant; he will neither ſerve you, nor ſport with you; both which, Behemoth, the Elephant, will do. Thirdly, In the difficulty and danger of taking him; So much danger is in it, that if you lay your hand on him, it were beſt to remember the battle, and do no more. Yet the Lord ſpeaks more concerning the danger of medling with Leviathan, in the ninth verſe through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and in the former part of the tenth.</p>

                  <p>Our hope is ſaid to be in vain three ways.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, When we hope for much, and get but little, according <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o that of the Prophet, convincing the Jews of their neglect in building the Temple (<hi>Hag.</hi> 1.9.) <hi>Ye looked for much, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it came to little;</hi> ye hoped for a plentiful harveſt, ye thought to have had a great crop, but it went very cloſe together; ye looked for cart-loads, but had ſcarcely handfuls: So ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, or give the meaning of that Propheſie (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. 4th and 6th compared) It is a Propheſie of Chriſt; at the 4th verſe Chriſt ſaith, <hi>I have laboured in vain, I have ſpent my ſtrength for nought, and in vain.</hi> Why did Chriſt ſay he had laboured in vain? He tells us the reaſon at the 6th verſe; <hi>And he ſaid,</hi> that is, the Lord ſaid to him, <hi>It is a light thing that thou ſhouldeſt be my ſervant to raiſe up the Tribes of</hi> Jacob, <hi>and to reſtore the preſerved of</hi> Iſrael; <hi>I will alſo give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayſt be my ſalvation unto the end of the earth.</hi> Chriſt looked upon his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as labour in vain, if he had died to redeem the Jews only, and therefore, ſaith God, <hi>I will give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayſt be my ſalvation to the end of the earth;</hi> and then, I hope, thou wilt not think thy labour in vain. Now when the Lord had granted Jeſus Chriſt, that he ſhould not only be ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Jews, but alſo to the ends of the earth, or to the Gentiles; he no longer ſaid, <hi>I have laboured in vain,</hi> but thought himſelf well rewarded for all his coſt and pains, for all that he did or ſuffered, to bring about and effect the ſalvation of man. Hope is in vain when we have, and get but little, expecting much.</p>
                  <pb n="683" facs="tcp:48669:354"/>
                  <p>Secondly, Hope it much more in vain, when we hope for much, and get nothing at all. As <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid to Chriſt (<hi>Luke</hi> 5.5.) <hi>We have toyled all night, and have taken nothing.</hi> That's like fiſhing for Leviathan; ſuch hope is utterly in vain. Such a vain hope the Church ſpake of (<hi>Jerem.</hi> 8.15.) <hi>We looked for peace</hi> (looking is an act of hope) <hi>and no good came,</hi> no good at all; that hope is vain, when we look for peace, and no good, no bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit comes. And thus the Lord ſpake of his ſmiting in vain, (<hi>Jerem.</hi> 2.30.) <hi>In vain have I ſmitten your Children.</hi> Why in vain? <hi>they have received no correction,</hi> that is, they were never a whit the better for it, they were not amended by it. When God ſpends his rods upon us, and we neither ceaſe to do evil, nor learn to do good, then he correcteth us in vain. And when he ſends his word, and we receive no good by it, no inſtruction by it, then his word is in vain. To waſh an <hi>Aethiopian,</hi> is the embleam of labour in vain, becauſe, how much ſoever you waſh him, he is not at all the whiter, nor is any change wrought in his complexion.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Hope is yet more in vain, when we look for good, and get hurt inſtead of good. The Prophet complained (<hi>Jerem.</hi> 8.15.) not only thus, <hi>We look for peace, and no good came;</hi> but (as it follows) <hi>for a time of health, and behold, trouble.</hi> But what was the time of health which they looked for, or what was the health which they looked for at that time? There is a two-fold health, a health of the body natural, and a health of the body po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick, which conſiſts in proſperity and peace; for this health they looked, <hi>but behold trouble.</hi> So (<hi>Jer.</hi> 14.19.) <hi>We looked for peace; and there was no good; and for a time of healing, and behold trouble.</hi> Thus the Lords Vineyard, that is, the Church of the Jews diſappointed the Lords expectation (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.5.) when, while <hi>he looked for grapes, it brought forth wild grapes,</hi> that is, as 'tis explained (<hi>ver.</hi> 7.) <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion inſtead of judgment, and inſtead of righteouſneſs a cry.</hi> This was the quite contrary; and this is the worſt way of having our hope in vain. It is ſaid (<hi>Job</hi> 27.8.) <hi>What is the hope of the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite, though he hath gained, when God taketh away his ſoul?</hi> Suppoſe a hypocrite hath gained much in this world, yea, ſuppoſe he hath got or gained all the world, yet <hi>what is his hope when God taketh away his ſoul?</hi> then he will not only find no God, but much trouble, pain, and anguiſh, and wrath, and hell for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more upon him. When Chriſt ſaith (<hi>Mat.</hi> 16.26.) <hi>What is a
<pb n="684" facs="tcp:48669:355"/> man profited, if he ſhall gain the whole world, and loſe his own ſoul?</hi> His meaning is not only this, that he ſhall have no profit at all, but he ſhall be utterly undone and broke for ever. How vain then is the hope of that man, yea, how vain a man is that, who hopes for profit or gain, in doing that which endangers the loſs of his ſoul, much more that by which his ſoul is abſolutely and for ever loſt.</p>
                  <p>Thus hope is in vain; Firſt, when we hope for much, and get little; Secondly, when we hope for much, and get nothing; Thirdly, when we hope for good, and get hurt. Now, in theſe two latter ſenſes we are to take the meaning of God here. A man may hope by uſe of means to catch Leviathan, yet he gets nothing, yea, probably loſeth much, or gets much hurt. <hi>Behold, the h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>pe of him is in vain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note, Firſt;
<q>It is hope of gain that uſually puts men upon action.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Lord ſuppoſeth that they who undertake the taking of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viathan, hope to gain much by taking him. 'Tis hope of attaining, that encourageth to doing. No man would be ſtirring, much leſs beſtir himſelf about any buſineſs, were it not for hope of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. And as it is hope of attaining that puts upon doing, ſo it is hope of attaining that puts us upon ſuffering. Who would ſuffer for Jeſus Chriſt, if he had not a hope of attaining ſomewhat bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than he can loſe by his ſufferings? therefore Jeſus Chriſt hath ſet that hope before us. To ſuffer rightly for Jeſus Chriſt, is ſo honourable, that we ſhould ſuffer willingly, though we get no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by it: yet he hath ſet a reward before us, a crown, by his Croſs; he hath aſſured us all our loſſes, even our loſs of life for his ſake, ſhall turn to our gain and profit. Hope of attaining is the motive to every undertaking. No wiſe man will meddle with doing that, which is either impoſſible to be done, or altogether unprofitable when it is done. Were it not for hope, the heart would faint. Firſt, in labouring. Secondly, in ſuffering. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in waiting. Hope is <hi>like a Helmet</hi> upon the head, when we are in danger of blows (2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.8.) and like <hi>an Anchor, both ſure and ſtedfaſt,</hi> when we are in ſtorms (<hi>Heb.</hi> 6.19.)</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Lord having ſaid before, <hi>Remember the battel, and do no more,</hi> adds, <hi>The hope of him is in vain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="685" facs="tcp:48669:355"/>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>It is a vain thing to go about that, which we ſee no ground of hope to have ſucceſs in, to do good upon, or to get any good by.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>As the Apoſtle exhorts us, <hi>To be ſtedfaſt and unmoveable, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes abounding in the work of the Lord, foraſmuch as we know</hi> (true believers do know, and all men ſhould know) <hi>that our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is not in vain in the Lord;</hi> ſo we have ground enough to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort all men from thoſe works, which we know, or may know, will be in vain. And if ſo,</p>
                  <p>Then, Firſt, <hi>How vain a thing is it for any man to ſin?</hi> Is there any thing to be gotten by ſin? <hi>I</hi> may well ſay to ſinners, as the Lord ſaith to <hi>Job,</hi> in the latter end of the 8th verſe, <hi>Do no more, ſin no more;</hi> your hope is in vain that think to gain by ſin, that hope to make your ſelves rich, great or happy, by ſin; <hi>Do no more,</hi> your hope is in vain. The Apoſtle puts the queſtion (<hi>Rom.</hi> 6.21.) <hi>What fruit had you then in thoſe things, whereof ye are now aſhamed?</hi> Have you got any benefit by them? have you got any thing worth the getting? All that is gained by ſin, will turn to loſs at laſt. <hi>Samuel</hi> charged the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> upon this account (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.21.) <hi>Turn ye not aſide</hi> (that is, do not ſin, do not turn from the Law of the Lord, do not depart from God, why?) <hi>for then ſhould you go after vain things, which cannot profit nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver, for they are vain.</hi> If you turn aſide from the wayes of God, to by-wayes; from the truths of God, to error; from the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, to idolatry; and from communion with God, to crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-comforts and contentments; you go after vain things which cannot profit. To be vain, and to be unprofitable, are the ſame thing. Take heed of ſin, for you cannot make any profit of it, you cannot raiſe any true revenue out of it, you will one time or other be aſhamed (as the Prophet ſpeaks) of all thoſe revenues; your hope that way is vain.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Then how vain a thing is it to oppoſe the Church of God!</hi> Why? becauſe there is no ground of hope for ſucceſs in that attempt. The world hath been upon it all along, but they could never effect nor accompliſh what they have imagined; they have done all, but proſper in it; they never had their end, which is the end or total deſtruction of the Church. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> would op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and vex <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the Church of God, and keep them low; but
<pb n="686" facs="tcp:48669:356"/> he could not attain his end, for the more he oppreſſed them, the more they multiplied; therefore all ſuch are ſaid to imagine a vain thing (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.1, 2.) <hi>Why do the Heathen rage, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple imagine a vain thing? the Kings of the earth ſet themſelves, and the Rulers take counſel together, againſt the Lord and againſt his anointed,</hi> but all in vain. Nothing leſs came of it, than what they imagined, or their imaginations came to nothing, yea, brought them to nothing. <hi>I</hi> (ſaith the Lord, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.3.) <hi>will make</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>a burdenſome ſtone for all people; all that burden them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with it, ſhall be cut in pieces.</hi> If any meddle with <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> they will find they lift at a very heavy ſtone, and that they med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle not with their match; they ſhall ſurely be not only over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matcht, but overthrown at length, who do ſo. The Church is founded upon a rock, and <hi>the gates of hell ſhall not prevail againſt it (Mat.</hi> 16.18.) that is, neither the counſels nor confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, neither the power nor the policy of men or devils, ſhall be able to prevail againſt it. The Hiſtory of the Church, ſaith of <hi>Diocleſian</hi> a cruel perſecuter, that for very vexation he gave up the Government of the Empire, becauſe he ſaw he could not ſuppreſs Chriſtianity by all his machinations againſt the Chriſtians. And doubtleſs they in the Goſpel (<hi>John</hi> 12.19.) were not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle troub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ed, when they ſaid <hi>among themſelves, Perceive ye how we prevail nothing? Behold, the world is gone after him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Note;
<q>The loſs of hope, or hope loſt, is the greateſt loſs.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>When God would ſhew mans worſt condition, he ſaith, <hi>His hope is in vain;</hi> he doth not ſay, <hi>his labour is in vain,</hi> but, <hi>his hope is in vain;</hi> that pincheth moſt of all, and that's it which will pinch Hypocrites moſt at laſt, who were in hope of injoying God; but not only their labour, but their hope ſhall be in vain: when they come big with expectation, and ſay, <hi>Lord, Lord, we have done thus and thus;</hi> when, as the fooliſh Virgins, they ſhall knock boldly, and cry earneſtly, <hi>Lord, Lord, open to us,</hi> the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer given them will be only this, <hi>I know you not;</hi> that is, I know you not for mine, as you preſumed your ſelves to be, even while you walked (not as mine, in wiſdom, but) in your own folly. This loſs of hope will grieve more than the loſs of Heaven. As Chriſt told the Phariſees, <hi>You ſhall weep, and gnaſh your teeth, when you
<pb n="687" facs="tcp:48669:356"/> ſee</hi> Abraham, <hi>and</hi> Iſaac, <hi>and</hi> Jacob, <hi>and all the Prophets in the Kingdom of God, and you your ſelves thruſt out.</hi> You thought that you ſhould be ſaved above all men; but ſaith Chriſt, you ſhall be thruſt out, and loſe your hopes. This the Lord ſpeaks, to ſhew the worſt of their condition, who attempt to take <hi>Leviathan, Their hope ſhall be in vain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the latter part of the verſe, the Lord gives us a farther ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, why their hope is in vain.</p>
                  <q>Shall not a man be caſt down at the ſight of him?</q>
                  <p>Is there any hope of taking him, at whoſe very ſight a man ſhall certainly <hi>be caſt down?</hi> There is a twofold <hi>caſting down.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, a caſting down by outward violence, when a man is thruſt down (as we ſpeak) <hi>by head and ſhoulders.</hi> Thus <hi>David</hi> caſt down <hi>Goliah,</hi> by a ſling and a ſtone.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There is a caſting down by inward trouble; as we uſually ſay, ſuch a man is <hi>mightily caſt down.</hi> Trouble of ſpirit, heart-vexation, and fear, caſt down many before any hand touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them. Chriſt ſpeaking of <hi>Capernaum,</hi> ſaith (<hi>Luke</hi> 10.15.) <hi>And thou</hi> Capernaum, <hi>which art exalted to heaven, ſhalt be thruſt down to hell.</hi> As if he had ſaid, thou haſt been high in thy expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations, and highly priviledged in thy enjoyments, having had the Goſpel preached to thee; but thou ſhalt not only fall down, but thou ſhalt be thruſt down into hell, with a kind of violence. When the Lord in the Text ſaith, <hi>Shall not one be caſt down?</hi> we are to underſtand it of a caſting down by the ſtrong impreſſion of aſtoniſhment and fear, of dread and trouble, ſeizing upon the mans ſpirit who comes near Leviathan, and therefore it followeth, <hi>Shall not one be caſt down</hi>
                     <q>At the ſight of him?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>A man ſhall no ſooner ſee him, but he ſhall ſink; and if ſo, then how little hope hath any one to grapple with him, and to take him? There is ſmall hope of overcoming this Leviathan, when a man at his ſight, or as far off as he can ſee him, is ſo afraid of him as to be caſt down with fear. The very ſight of a Whale is a terror to Mariners and Sea-men, they are afraid their Ship may be overturn'd and ſpoyled by him.</p>
                  <pb n="688" facs="tcp:48669:357"/>
                  <p>Some read the words thus; <hi>Will he be caſt down even at the ſight of him?</hi> and they give this meaning of it. Will the Levia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than be caſt down at the ſight of a man, when he cometh pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to take him? Thou thinkeſt Leviathan a poor ſpirited fiſh; or that he will be afraid of thy looks, or to ſee thee, as other fiſhes are, who when they ſee or apprehend a man near, <hi>ſcuttle away,</hi> as we ſay; but thou wilt find Leviathan is a fiſh that will not be afraid at the ſight of thee. This is a good ſenſe, but I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that before given more ſutable; that the ſight of Levia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, or a Leviathan, as ſoon as ſeen, is ſo terrible, that a man will be ſtricken with fear as ſoon as he ſeeth him, <hi>Shall not one be caſt down at the ſight of him?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note, Firſt;
<q>The ſight of the eye worketh much upon the heart.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Lord ſaith not, <hi>Shall not one be caſt down by the force of him,</hi> but, <hi>at the very ſight of him.</hi> The eye hath a mighty operation upon the inward man, yea, upon the whole man; the eye hath a mighty force upon the heart as to three things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It hath a mighty force upon the heart as to joy. If we ſee a perſon that we have a great deal of love for, how do we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce preſently at the ſight of him! 'Tis true alſo of things. It is ſaid of <hi>Jacob (Gen.</hi> 45.27.) <hi>When he ſaw the wagons which</hi> Joſeph <hi>had ſent to carry him, his ſpirit revived;</hi> it put a new life into him, to ſee that which gave him much aſſurance, that he ſhould ſee a perſon that was the deſire of his eyes, his beloved ſon <hi>Joſeph;</hi> it revived the old man, and made him even young a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. And as a pleaſing ſight made old <hi>Jacob,</hi> as it were, begin to live again; ſo old <hi>Simeon</hi> rejoyced ſo much at the ſight of Chriſt, that he had done with living, or had enough of it, and therefore ſaid, <hi>Now letteſt thou thy ſervant depart in peace, for mine eyes have ſeen thy ſalvation;</hi> that is, he had ſeen Chriſt with the eye of his body, and he had a ſight of Chriſt by the eye of his faith; this ſight lifted him above all things ſeen. A ſenſitive ſight of good, doth very much chear, refreſh, and rejoyce the heart, much more an intellectual ſight; how much doth the ſight of faith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh the ſoul, and cauſe us to rejoyce! It is ſaid of believers, <hi>They rejoyce with joy unſpeakable and glorious,</hi> at the ſight which

Faith gives the ſoul a view of Chriſt in all his excellency and glory, in his love and in his lovelineſs, in his righteouſneſs and holineſs: faith gets a view of Chriſt in all his beauty; and beholding him, we rejoyce with joy unſpeakable. If the ſight of the bodily eye cauſeth the ſoul to rejoyce, how much more the ſight of the eye of faith! the eye of either fixed upon deſirable objects, affects the heart with joy.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The ſight of the eye fixt upon ſorrowful objects, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects the heart with ſorrow (<hi>Lam.</hi> 3.51.) <hi>Mine eye affects my heart,</hi> ſaid lamenting <hi>Jeremiah;</hi> that is, ſeeing the calamities that are upon my people, I cannot but weep and mourn. Chriſt ſaith of the yet blinded and hardned <hi>Jews, They ſhall look on me whom they have pierced, and they ſhall mourn (Zach.</hi> 12.10.) They ſhall ſhed tears of true repentance, when they ſhall ſee him with an eye of ſence, joyned with an eye of faith, whoſe blood they ſhed. Some of them ſaw him once with an eye of ſenſe, without an eye of faith, and then they ſhed his blood; but when they ſhall ſee him with both, or only with an eye of faith, they ſhall mourn for ſhedding it. When good <hi>Nehemiah</hi> heard in what a ruinous condition the City <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was, <hi>he ſate down, and wept, and imourned certain dayes (Neh.</hi> 1.4.) his ear affected his heart, how much more would his eye, had he been a ſpectator (as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he was) of thoſe ruines!</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The ſight of the eye affects the heart with fear. There are ſome ſights very dreadful; ſo ſaith the Text and Point, <hi>Shall not one be caſt down at the ſight of him?</hi> This leads to a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Note, which is this:
<q>The Lord hath put a terribleneſs upon ſome creatures, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to man.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Man is a terror to ſome creatures; yet others are a terror, or very terrible to man. Let us conſider, and uſefully remember this, for it is a fruit of ſin. What is the reaſon we are caſt down at the ſight of any creature? we may thank our ſins for it; all

                     </gap>hat door. Why is man afraid or ſeized with a kind of horror, at the ſight of a Toad or Serpent? of a Bear or Lion looſe? How comes it to paſs, that man, whom God made Lord over all the creatures, doth fear any, eſpecially ſo many of them? Is not this a conſequent, yea, an effect of ſin? When God made the Covenant with <hi>Noah (Gen.</hi> 9.2.) <hi>God bleſſed him and his ſons, and ſaid unto them, be fruitful and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, and repleniſh the earth: and the fear of you, and the dread of you, ſhall be upon every beaſt of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fiſhes of the Sea; the fear and dread of you ſhall be upon them.</hi> 'Tis of the Lord that any of the creatures are afraid and ſtand in awe of us; we have deſerved, that the very Sheep and Dove ſhould be a terror to us. 'Tis of the Lord that the fear and dread of us is upon any creature, and 'tis from our ſin that any creature is a fear and dread to us: It is a mercy that ſo many creatures are afraid of us; that any of the creatures ſtand in fear of us, is a fruit of the goodneſs of God; and that we are afraid of any creature, is a fruit of our ſin. Let us make a good uſe of this word, <hi>Shall not one be afraid at the ſight of him?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And hence we may infer;
<q>If the ſight of ſome creatures aſtoniſh us, how will the ſight of God, of an angry God aſtoniſh us!</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>All the dread and terribleneſs that is in a Lion, or Bear, or Dragon, what is it to what is in God? <hi>With God is terrible Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty.</hi> The terribleneſs of the moſt terrible deadly creature, yea, of death, the King of terrors, is but a ſcare-crow to the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of God; and it is God who hath planted terror in any creature, in man eſpecially. What is the reaſon why Kings and inferiour Magiſtrates are ſo terrible to evil men? is it not becauſe God hath planted ſuch a terribleneſs in them, or hath cloathed them (with his own garment) terrible majeſty towards evil do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers? (<hi>Rom.</hi> 13.3, 4.) Now I ſay, if ſome creatures are ſo terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that a man is caſt down at the ſight of them, then how terrible is God! The Apoſtle <hi>John (Rev.</hi> 6.15, 16, 17.) repreſents a world of wicked ones, or all the wicked of the world, caſt down at the ſight of Jeſus Chriſt; <hi>The Kings of the earth, &amp; the great men, &amp; the rich men, and the chief Captains, and the mighty men, and every bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
<pb n="691" facs="tcp:48669:358"/> and every free-man, hid themſelves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains, and ſaid to the mountains and rocks, fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that ſitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb; for the great day of his wrath is come, and who ſhall be able to ſtand?</hi> Some are caſt down at the ſight of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viathan, but all the unbelieving world ſhall be caſt down at the ſight of Chriſt; all the unbelieving Kings, Princes, and Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of the world ſhall be caſt down before Chriſt; O how dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful will he be to them! and therefore (I would conclude with that) let us be caſt down at the ſight of ſin, which hath cauſed the ſight of the creature, and of God alſo, to be ſo dreadful to us. God had never been terrible to us, had it not been for ſin; nor had the ſight of any creature been terrible to us, had we not ſinned. When <hi>Adam</hi> had ſinned, then God was terrible to him, then preſently he hid himſelf. O therefore be caſt down at the ſight of ſin, which hath made both God and many creatures a terror, a caſting down to us. How terrible this creature Leviathan is to man, appears further, by what the Lord ſaith next.</p>

                  <p>The former part of this verſe, carrieth on the matter of the whole former verſe, <hi>None is ſo fierce that dare ſtir him up;</hi> that is, Leviathan is a creature ſo fierce, ſo cruel, that none, how fierce ſoever, dare provoke him, no, nor awaken him. The words may be taken two wayes.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, No man dares challenge or provoke him when he is awake. The word rendred <hi>fierce,</hi> properly ſignifies <hi>cruel,</hi> becauſe cruelty makes men fierce, or becauſe fierce men are uſually very cruel. <hi>None is ſo fierce as to ſtir him up.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note, Firſt;
<q>There is no wiſdom in provoking an enemy that is too ſtrong for us.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wiſe men, though bold, and poſſibly cruel too, yet when at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts are exceeding dangerous, will not venture. Phyſicians will not ſtir ſome humours in the body, for it would be like ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of a fierce Lion that is aſleep; they dare not provoke them,
<pb n="692" facs="tcp:48669:359"/> but do all they can to attemper and allay them; to ſtir ſuch a humour were to ſtir Leviathan. He hath more raſhneſs than courage, who meddles with more than his match, or (as ſome ſay) <hi>conjures up a ſpirit, that he cannot lay again.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Saith the Lord, <hi>none is ſo fierce</hi> or cruel <hi>that dare ſtir him up.</hi> He means not cruel to Leviathan, but to himſelf; none is ſo cruel to himſelf, as to go about to ſtir up Leviathan, becauſe there is ſo much danger in that attempt.</p>
                  <p>Whence, Obſerve;
<q>They who run themſelves upon great dangers unadviſedly are cruel to themſelves.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>They are their own enemies, and the greateſt enemies to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. How cruel then are ſinners to their own ſouls, who are ſo fierce as daily to ſtir up Leviathan! (<hi>Prov.</hi> 6.32.) <hi>Whoſoever committeth adultery with a woman hath no underſtanding; he that doth it deſtroyeth his own ſoul;</hi> ſurely then he is cruel to his own ſoul: he ſeems to be very kind to his harlot, but he is very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, yea, cruel to himſelf (<hi>Pro.</hi> 8.36.) <hi>He that ſinneth againſt me</hi> (ſaith <hi>Wiſdom) wrongeth his own ſoul: all they that hate me, love death.</hi> 'Tis Chriſt that ſpeaks thus, <hi>he that ſinneth againſt me, wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his own ſoul,</hi> he is cruel to himſelf. Many, when they ſin, do it to pleaſe themſelves: O what a good turn do they hope to do themſelves, when they venture upon unlawful pleaſures or profits; <hi>But he that doth ſo, hateth me</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>and he that hateth me, loves death.</hi> How cruel is that man to his own life, that is in love with death; yet ſo in truth are they who love any ſin, by ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. You may (as was toucht before) ſtir up and awaken a ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py conſcience, and conſcience may be more terrible than Levia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than; yea, by ſin, you may awaken and ſtir up the ſleeping ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of God, who is more than a thouſand Leviathans, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences. Once more remember, that poſſibly, by not ſtirring up your ſelves to take hold of God, you may ſtir up God to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with you, as 'tis ſaid (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.6, 7.) <hi>Our iniquities like the wind have taken us away.</hi> What follows? <hi>And</hi> (or <hi>for) there is none that calleth upon thy name, that ſtirreth up himſelf to take hold of thee.</hi> Which words, as I apprehend, may be taken two ways. Firſt, As ſhewing their ſluggiſhneſs, that though their iniquities, that is, the puniſhment of their iniquities, carried them
<pb n="693" facs="tcp:48669:359"/> away, or they were carried <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>way as a puniſhment of their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, yet they did not ſtir up themſelves to call upon the name of God, nor to take hold of him. Secondly, As ſhewing the reaſon, why their iniquities carried them away, even, becauſe they did not ſtir up themſelves to take hold of God. Their not ſtirring up themſelves to take hold of God, ſtirred up God againſt them. If we do not ſtir up our ſelves, eſpecially, when at any time we are compaſſed about with ſins and dangers, or with dangers procured and brought upon us by our ſins, as with Levia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans, we may ſtir up God againſt us as a Leviathan. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us take heed, leſt we be found fierce and cruel againſt our own ſouls, by ſinning againſt God, or by not ſtirring up our ſelves to take hold of God; ſuch neglects are full of provocations.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto we have had inſtruction concerning this Leviathan, how great, how ſtout, how fierce and cruel he is: now the Lord makes application. He hath been di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>courſing about a huge tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous Sea-monſter; but what is all this for? Surely, for very great uſe: And the Lord maketh uſe of it two ways.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, In this verſe, to ſhew his own <hi>irreſiſtibleneſs.</hi> If none can ſtand before Leviathan, <hi>then who can ſtand before me?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, In the (11th verſe) to ſhew his own <hi>independency,</hi> that he hath no need of any creature: <hi>Who hath prevented me that I ſhould repay him?</hi> And all this the Lord makes good by that great aſſertion, <hi>for whatſoever is under the whole heaven is mine;</hi> this great Leviathan is mine to do what I will with him. This is the ſum of that two-fold Application, which the Lord makes from the hitherto deſcription of L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>viathan; the firſt part whereof is expreſſed in the latter part of the 10th verſe.</p>
                  <q>Who then is able to ſtand before me?</q>
                  <p>As is the Lord had ſaid, <hi>no man is able to ſtand before me.</hi> If this creature, Leviathan, be ſo terrible, that no man is able to ſtand before him? then, who can ſtand before me? for all the ſtrength and courage that Leviathan hath, I have given him, and 'tis nothing to what I have; 'tis not ſo much to me as a drop of the bucket, or a duſt of the ballance, to the whole world. Can none ſtand before Leviathan? <hi>Who then can ſtand before me?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>One Tranſlation ſaith, <hi>Can you reſiſt before my look?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Quis raſiſtere potent vultu meo? <hi>Scult.</hi>
                     </note> As God had ſaid before, one <hi>ſhall be caſt down at the ſight of him,</hi> namely,
<pb n="694" facs="tcp:48669:360"/> of Leviathan; ſo here, <hi>Can any man ſtand before me, or at the ſight of me?</hi> Is any man able to abide my look, the majeſty of my eye? Surely no. The ſence is much the ſame with that of our reading, <hi>Who then is able to ſtand before me?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence, Obſerve;
<q>Our inability to ſtand before mighty creatures, ſhould mind us of our utter inability to ſtand before the Almighty God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is the moſt proper uſe that ever was made of a doctrine. The Lord made a promiſe (and it was a very wonderful promiſe which the Lord made) to <hi>Joſhua (Joſh.</hi> 1.5.) <hi>There ſhall not any man be able to ſtand before thee all the days of thy life.</hi> What a promiſe was here to a man! <hi>Joſhua</hi> was indeed one of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thieſt warriers that ever was upon the earth, and may well be reckoned, not only one of, but the cheif or moſt worthy, among the nine Worthies of the world, ſeing no man could ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, nor ſhould, in way of oppoſition, all the days of his life. Now if the Lord promiſed ſuch a power unto <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and made it good, that none ſhould be able to ſtand before him all the days of his life; then who among the children of men ſhall be able to ſtand before God? The Prophet <hi>Malachy</hi> ſpeaking of Chriſts coming (<hi>Chap.</hi> 3.1.) ſaith, <hi>Behold he ſhall ſuddenly come into his Temple, even the Meſſenger of the Covenant.</hi> But what follows? (<hi>ver.</hi> 2.) <hi>Who may abide the day of his coming?</hi> If there was ſuch a terribleneſs in Chriſts coming in the fleſh, as to the ſpiritual power and effects of it, that the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Who may abide the day of his coming?</hi> O then, who ſhall be able to ſtand before Chriſt, when he ſhall come in glory to judge the earth? If they could not abide the day of his coming, when he came with <hi>refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners fire, and fullers ſope,</hi> how will they be able to ſtand before him, when he cometh with <hi>conſuming fire!</hi> No man can ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, in any of theſe four ways.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, In his own wiſdom, to plead it out with God. If we plead with God, our wiſdom will be found fooliſhneſs, and we our ſelves ſhall be confounded as fools. <hi>The Lord</hi> (ſaith <hi>Job,</hi> Chap. 12.17.) <hi>maketh the Judges fools.</hi> Judges are uſually full of wiſdom, yet God maketh even them fools. God in ſtrict ſenſe maketh none, nor would he have any made Judges, but the wiſe; yet he himſelf can make the wiſeſt of them fools. And if ſo,
<pb n="695" facs="tcp:48669:360"/> then there is no ſtanding before God in our own wiſdom.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There is no ſtanding before God in our own ſtrength or power. Our ſtrength is but weakneſs, yea, rottenn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſs to his, as the Prophet ſpeaks (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.24.) <hi>Their root ſhall be rottenneſs, and there bloſſome ſhall go up as the duſt.</hi> Thus it is with all fleſh; if they ſtand in their own ſtrength, their root (which is their ſtrength) ſhall be as rottenneſs, and their bloſſome (which is their beauty) ſhall go up as the duſt.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, There is no ſtanding before God in our own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, to be acquitted, accepted, and juſtified. There are many deficiencies and flaw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> in our righteouſneſs, therefore we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtand before God in it; there is much unrighteouſneſs in our righteouſneſs, therefore we cannot ſtand before God in it; and how righteous (if I may ſo ſpeak) ſoever our righteouſneſs is, or may be, yet we cannot ſtand before God in it, becauſe he hath appointed another righteouſneſs, or the righteouſneſs of another, even the righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, for us, to ſtand before him in.</p>
                  <p>So then, if we would ſtand before God, all theſe muſt be laid down; we muſt lay down our own wiſdom, we muſt become fools, that we may be wiſe; we muſt lay down our own ſtrength, we muſt become weak, that we may be ſtrong; and we muſt lay down our own righteouſneſs, and look upon our ſelves as guilty creatures, as condemned perſons, as caſt and loſt, in our ſelves: we muſt have nothing, but the wiſdom, and ſtrength, and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of God to ſtand before God in, that is, we muſt ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God by faith: God is not terrible to ſuch, they may ſtand before God; the pooreſt ſinner may ſtand before God in the wiſdom, and ſtrength, and righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt. Thus we may anſwer the queſtion; <hi>Who can ſtand before me?</hi> ſaith God: I can ſtand before thee, ſaith a believer; I can ſtand before thee with boldneſs, being quit of ſelf-wiſdom, ſtrength and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and looking to Chriſt Jeſus for all.</p>
                  <p>How ſweet, how gracious, and how delightful is the preſence of God to an humble believing ſoul, to a broken-hearted ſinner! The Lord ſaith, <hi>I will dwell with ſuch a one;</hi> he ſhall not only come and ſtand before me, but I will come and ſit down with him, I will take up my abode in an humble ſoul, in an empty ſoul. <hi>Who is able to ſtand before me?</hi> (ſaith God) None can in their own wiſdom,
<pb n="696" facs="tcp:48669:361"/> ſtrength or righteouſneſs, but in Chriſt we may. From hence we may more than conclude,</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>That there is no ſtanding before God in our ſins.</hi> God is terrible to ſinners, that is, to thoſe who continue in the love and practice of their ſins: God is of purer eyes, than to behold and approve evil. <hi>David</hi> having ſpoken of thoſe (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.1.) <hi>that ſtand in the way of ſinners,</hi> ſaith (at the 5th <hi>ver.</hi>) there is <hi>a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for them in the Judgment.</hi> They that ſtand in the way of ſinners, cannot ſtand at the Judgment-ſeat of God. <hi>Job</hi> ſaid (<hi>Chap.</hi> 13.16.) <hi>A hypocrite ſhall not come before him,</hi> that is, he ſhall not come with acceptance before God. Though hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites will thruſt themſelves into the preſence of God, yet they ſhall not come before him; though now an hypocrite may come before God in any outward performance, yet not with any acceptance: and to be ſure he ſhall not come before God in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and if he ſhall not come before him, how can he ſtand before him? The Lord will even blow him away. <hi>Only they that fall down before God are able to ſtand before him.</hi> We muſt fall down before God, in a ſence of our own vileneſs and wretchedneſs, and then we ſhall be able to ſtand before him, and to behold his pleaſed face by an eye of faith: A ſtout ſinner ſhall never ſtand before him. It is ſaid (<hi>Zech.</hi> 3.1.) <hi>Joſhua ſtood before the Angel of the Lord.</hi> He had much ado to keep his ſtanding; why? becauſe the Devil ſtood there to reſiſt him, and pointed to his filthy garments: but the Angel pleaded with the Lord, to take away his filthy gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and when they were taken away, then he was able to ſtand before God. It is ſaid (<hi>Zech.</hi> 4.14.) which is conceived to be meant of <hi>Joſhua</hi> and <hi>Zerubbabel) Theſe are the two anointed ones, which ſtand before the Lord of the whole earth.</hi> And as they in the type, ſo all that are Olive-branches, that have the pure oil of the Spirit, may and ſhall ſtand before God. We become Olive-branches in Chriſt, having the oil, or the graces of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ſent down into our hearts, according to the promiſe. Holy and humble ſouls, Olive-branches, they that are full of the grace and Spirit of our Lord Jeſus, ſhall ſtand before God; but as for man himſelf, that is, man in himſelf, in his own wiſdom, ſtrength or righteouſneſs, above all, in his ſins and unrighteouſneſs, can never ſtand before God. If he cannot ſtand before Leviathan? how can he ſtand before the Lord? This is a great Goſpel truth
<pb n="697" facs="tcp:48669:361"/> given in by himſelf, while he is treating of this ſea-monſter. There is no ſtanding before God in our ſelves; there is no ſtanding before God without a Mediator; and there is no Mediator but Jeſus Chriſt, who is both God and Man, or God-man, for man to ſtand before God in.</p>
                  <p>Thus much of the firſt uſe or inference, which the Lord makes from all that he had ſaid of Leviathan. The ſecond inference followeth in the next verſe.</p>

                     <hi>that I may pay him again.</hi> Theſe words the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> plainly alludes to (ſome conceive he quotes them) in the 35th verſe of the 11th Chapter of his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans, Who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counſeller? or who hath firſt given to him? and it ſhall be recompenſed unto him again.</hi> So ſaith Saint <hi>Paul;</hi> and here the Lord himſelf ſaith, <hi>Who hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented me that I ſhould repay him?</hi> as much as to ſay, <hi>Who hath firſt given to me? and it ſhall be recompenſed unto him again.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>Who hath prevented me?</q>
                  <p>The Lord ſeems in theſe words,<note place="margin">Quis oſtendit mihi viam in cretione totius mundi? <hi>Vatebl.</hi>
                     </note> to make proclamation all the world over, to enquire among Angels and Men, who it is, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be any one that can come forth and ſay, he hath <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To prevent,</hi> is to be aforehand with another in courteſie or kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in help or aſſiſtance. God prevents man in all theſe, but no man hath prevented God in any one of them. We may give a three-fold interpretation of this divine challenge.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Who hath prevented me, or who was afore-hand with me</hi> in the work of Creation? who helpt me to make <hi>Leviathan?</hi>
                     <pb n="698" facs="tcp:48669:362"/> you ſee what a piece of work he is, how vaſt, how dreadful a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he is: who helped me? or who gave me any help in the forming, or creating of him? Several expound this queſtion of the Lords independency in the work of creation; none began to him, none directed him how to create, none counſelled him what to create. The Apoſtle uſeth that word, <hi>Who hath been his counſeller?</hi> No man hath been the Lords counſeller, nor did he need any counſel, in or about any of his works. And as none were his counſellers to give him advice, ſo none were, his helpers to give him any aſſiſtance, to bring the work about; no hand hath been put to it, but his own; no hand was at it, nor in it, but his own. <hi>I am he</hi> (ſaith the Lord, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.24.) <hi>that maketh all things, that ſtretcheth forth the heavens alone, that ſpreadeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad the earth by my ſelf;</hi> I have done all alone, all by my ſelf, the Angels did not help me. As God made the Angels without help, ſo he uſed not the help of Angels in making any thing elſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Who hath <hi>prevented me,</hi> in governing and diſpoſing the affairs of the world? I have had no counſel hitherto for that: And ſhall any now take upon them to teach me the art of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, In general, <hi>Who hath prevented me?</hi> that is, <hi>who hath done me any good office?</hi> who contributed the leaſt benefit to me? to whom am I beholding for the leaſt mite?</p>
                  <q>That I ſhould repay him.</q>
                  <p>

                        </gap>
                     </note>That is, that I ſhould be engaged to repay him. The word which we render <hi>to repay,</hi> ſignifies properly <hi>to make peace;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe when debts are paid, and what is due diſcharged, then all is quiet, there is no matter of difference remaining. As if the Lord had ſaid, <hi>If any one can produce any bill, or bond, or make proof, that I ſtand indebted to him,</hi> I am ready to ſatisfie him, and to diſcharge all my obligations. <hi>Who hath prevented me that I ſhould repay him?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note, Firſt;
<q>God will not be in any mans debt.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>If any can make it good, that they have prevented him, that they have given him counſel or aſſiſtance in his works of creation and providence, or that they have done him the leaſt courteſie, they ſhall receive to the full worth and value of it. What we do
<pb n="699" facs="tcp:48669:362"/> in way of duty to the Lord, he is ready to reward us for it; we ſhall not loſe our labour, though God be no gainer by it: And though it be through his grace, ſtrength and aſſiſtance, that we do any good, yet we ſhall be rewarded as if we had done it alone. Surely, then God would not be in our debt, if we could do any thing alone, or that did in it ſelf oblige him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Note;
<q>God is afore-hand with us, not we with him.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Lord prevents us, we do not prevent him: That's it which the Lord would then have <hi>Job,</hi> and now us to underſtand, by this queſtion, <hi>Who hath prevented me?</hi> even that himſelf hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented us all, and in all, by his grace and goodneſs, in any good we have received or done. <hi>David</hi> waited for this preventing grace (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 59.10.) <hi>The God of my mercy ſhall prevent me, he ſhall let me ſee my deſire upon mine enemies;</hi> he ſhall prevent, not only my endeavours, but even my deſires and wiſhes. Yet what in this <hi>Pſalm</hi> he profeſſed an aſſurance of, in another <hi>Pſalm</hi> (to ſhew that our aſſurance of mercy muſt not give a ſtop to duty) he puts into a prayer (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 79.8.) <hi>O remember not againſt us former iniquities, let thy tender mercies ſpeedily prevent us, for we are brought very low.</hi> The Lord hath preventing mercies for his people, in their low eſtate. Though we do not prevent the Lord, though we are not before-hand with him by our preparations and prayers, by our repentings and reformings in our low eſtate, yet he hath mercies ready and prepared for us; yea, though we <hi>come forth to meet the Lord</hi> (as we are adviſed, <hi>Amos</hi> 4.12.) humbling our ſelves before him, in prayers and tears, yet this doth not prevent the Lord, but he prevents us by his grace and favour, helping us to mourn and pray. And as the Lord alwayes prevents us by helping us to pray, ſo he ſometimes prevents us with an anſwer to our prayers, before he helps us to pray (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.24.) <hi>It ſhall come to paſs, that before they call I will anſwer, and while they are yet ſpeaking, I will hear;</hi> that is, they ſhall have an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to their prayers, before they have made their prayers: ſo that, when we have made many prayers, and have been long in prayer, much faſting and humbling our ſelves, yet mercy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents us. Mercy comes uſually, before we are well fitted for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, alwayes before we have merited or deſerved it.</p>
                  <pb n="700" facs="tcp:48669:363"/>
                  <p>But ſaith not <hi>David (Pſal.</hi> 88.13.) <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto thee have I cryed, O Lord, and in the morning ſhall my prayer prevent thee.</hi> Here <hi>David</hi> ſeemed to be afore-hand with God. <hi>Who hath prevented me?</hi> ſaith God; yet <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>My prayer ſhall prevent thee.</hi> The meaning is only this, That <hi>David</hi> would pray very early and very earneſtly, or that <hi>David</hi> would watch unto prayer, and ſo, if poſſible, even prevent God; not that his prayers did indeed prevent God, but he was reſolved to ſet ſo hard to, and ſit ſo cloſe at the duty of prayer, that if ſuch a thing could be, he would even prevent him, he would, as we may ſay, take God before he was awake, as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpake elſewhere, <hi>Ariſe, O God, why ſleepeſt thou?</hi> Their prayer may be ſaid to prevent God, who pray early and earneſtly, according to that of <hi>David (Pſal.</hi> 5.3.) <hi>My voice ſhalt thou hear in the morning, O Lord, in the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.140.) <hi>Mine eyes prevent the night watches.</hi> He was at it very early, he ſought the Lord very diligently. That's all we are to underſtand by ſuch expreſſions; for the Lord is then afore-hand with us in mercies, when we are moſt early and moſt inſtant in our duties. The Lord, who is <hi>the beginning and the end,</hi> and who knows the end of all things from the beginning, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten gives us our end, or what we aimed at in prayer, before we begin.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Note;
<q>God is ſelf-ſufficient, he can do his whole work alone.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Take it in the inſtance of the Text, he needs no help to create Leviathan, nor needs he the help of any creature to deſtroy Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viathan; what he made without help, he can (as I may ſay) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>make make without help. The Lord, who is all-ſufficient to do any work, or bring what he pleaſeth to paſs for us, is alſo ſelf-ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, or able to do any work, or what he pleaſeth, for himſelf, that is, to pleaſe himſelf. It is a great honour to God that he can command what he will, and whom he will, to help him in any of his works; but it is a far greater honour to the great God, that he needs not any help to do or bring about any of his works. When the Apoſtle had ſaid, <hi>Who hath given to him? and it ſhall be recompenced unto him again? (Rom.</hi> 11.35.) He preſently gives this reaſon (which is the point in hand) <hi>ver.</hi> 36.)
<pb n="701" facs="tcp:48669:363"/> 
                     <hi>For of him are all things;</hi> that is, he is the ſole efficient of all things, all things are from him, as from the firſt principle or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; and he orders all things (as it followeth in the ſame verſe) <hi>through him are all things.</hi>

And thus ſpake the ſame Apoſtle to the great Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers at <hi>Athens (Acts</hi> 17.28.) <hi>In him we live, and move, and have our being.</hi> As if it had been ſaid, <hi>Of him are all things, and through him are all things;</hi> and therefore, <hi>to him are all things.</hi> All creatures turn about, as in a circle, to their Creator; all things end in him, or he is the end of all, as all things began in him, and by him.</p>
                  <p>This truth is a ſpring of comfort and conſolation to all the faithful; or, from this general head many ſtreams flow, which may both inſtruct and comfort the City of God. From hence we may learn, or be inſtructed,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Creatures, one or other, men or Angels, cannot merit any thing at the hand of God.</hi> Man gives God nothing, but what he firſt receives from him; for, <hi>who hath prevented him?</hi> therefore there's no merit, preventing-mercy excludes and ſhuts it out of doors.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, which followeth upon that, <hi>God is debtor to no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> he oweth us nothing, we owe him all.<note place="margin">Deus factus eſt debitor non a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquid à nobis accipiendo, ſed quod ei placuit promitiendo. <hi>Aug.</hi> de verb. Dom. Ser. <hi>16.</hi>

                        </gap>, Deus enim propriè non retribuit ſed tribuit.</note> 
                     <hi>Who hath prevented me?</hi> ſaith God. If we have any thing, we have it from him, but he hath nothing from us; therefore we are in his books, he is not at all in ours. All that God is indebted to us, is by his promiſes, which proceed freely from himſelf; we receive no good upon the worthineſs of what we have done, but becauſe he hath aſſured us we ſhall receive good if we do good, ſo and ſo, or are ſuch and ſuch. God gives us much, but retributes us nothing; all his rewards are free gifts, or pure alms.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>God can do no creature any wrong.</hi> Man hath no right to any thing he hath inherent in, or, ariſing from himſelf; nor hath man obliged God at all to give him any thing: therefore he can do man no wrong, how little ſoever he gives him, or how much ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he takes from him. So that, if any man ſhall ſay, he will not
<pb n="702" facs="tcp:48669:364"/> contend with me by right, but by might, and ſhall complain that ſomething is taken from him which he would not, or not given him which he would; what right hath any man to plead with God upon, who hath no right to any thing, but by the gift of God?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Then the grace of God to man, is altogether free.</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny expound this Scripture, as denying the fore-ſight of mans works, or worthineſs of his faith, or perſeverance in grace, as to the grace of Election. God did not elect us, becauſe he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw any worthineſs in us,<note place="margin">Nemo ut divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na illum ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quatur gratia prius aliquid contulit Deo; ſi ergo &amp; ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cti praevenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te ſe gratia ſequuntur &amp; reprobi juxta quod merentur accipiunt, &amp; de miſerecordia inveniunt ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cti quod lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, &amp; de ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitia non ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent reprobi quod accuſent. Bene igitur di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citur quis ante dedit. <hi>Greg.</hi>
                     </note> nor will he ſave us upon the deſert of any thing done by us. The foundation-ſtone of Election, and the top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone of Salvation, are laid in free grace.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>We have no reaſon to be diſcouraged, what deficiency ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we ſee in the creature, as to any thing we deſire God ſhould do for us, foraſmuch as none have prevented God, either with counſel or aſſiſtance in any of thoſe great things which he hath already done, either for our ſelves or others.</hi> What cannot he do for us alone, who made Heaven and Earth alone! The Lord can begin and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, how and when he pleaſeth: <hi>He is a rock, and his work is perfect.</hi> As in ſpirituals, <hi>he is the Author and finiſher of our faith, (Heb.</hi> 12.2.) ſo in temporals, he is the Author and finiſher of all our comforts, deliverances and ſalvations. When we have no help at all in our ſelves, nor in any creature, there is enough to be had in God (<hi>Hoſea</hi> 14.3.) <hi>With thee the fatherleſs find mercy;</hi> that is, they find mercy with thee (and if mercy, then help) who are as helpleſs as a fatherleſs child, they eſpecially who look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themſelves as fatherleſs, what help and ſtrength, what fathers or friends ſoever they have in this world, if God be not their help and ſtrength, their friend and father. When we are convinced that only God can help us, when we have other helps, then God alone will help us, though we have no other helpers; as he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed <hi>Judah (Hoſea</hi> 1.7.) <hi>I will have mercy upon the houſe of</hi> Judah, <hi>and will ſave them by the Lord their God, and will not ſave them by bow, nor by ſword, nor by battel, by horſes nor by horſe-men.</hi> As if the Lord had ſaid, <hi>I will do all for</hi> Judah <hi>my ſelf alone, though I could have others to do it by.</hi> It is ſeldome that God hath (as School-men ſpeak) an immediate attingence upon any effect (he commonly uſeth inſtruments) yet he ſometimes hath, and hath as often as himſelf pleaſeth. As our mercies are alwayes of grace only, ſo ſometimes they are wrought out by the power of God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
<pb n="703" facs="tcp:48669:364"/> And what power ſoever is ſeen working at them, 'tis his power that doth the work; his wheel is in every wheel.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>What cauſe have we to magnifie the free grace and mighty power of God.</hi> He is able to do for us, though all oppoſe him; and he is willing to do for us, though none, nor we our ſelves prevent him. Such is the power of God, that he can over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come all oppoſition in others, againſt what he hath a mind to do for us; and ſuch is the freeneſs of his grace, that it over-paſſeth, or rather paſſeth by all thoſe indiſpoſitions in us, which might cauſe him to forbear doing, or have no mind to do, any thing for us.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, If none have prevented the Lord, if all the good we have, and all that we ſhall have, floweth freely to us, then we ſhould be very thankful to God for every good we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, &amp; very full of purpoſes to praiſe him for whatever we ſhall further receive. This Inference the Apoſtle makes in the laſt words of (<hi>Rom.</hi> 11.) <hi>Of him, and through him, and to him, are all things, to whom be glory for ever, Amen.</hi> Let us never be found <hi>ſacrificing to our own net, nor burning incenſe to our own drag,</hi> as if <hi>by them our portion</hi> (in ſpirituals or temporals) <hi>were fat, and our meat plenteous.</hi> Let us put praiſe far from our ſelves, and ſay with the <hi>Pſalmiſt, Not unto us, not unto us,</hi> but to thy name, O Lord, be praiſe and glory.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Let us be very humble. The Lord puts this queſtion to <hi>Job</hi> to humble him; &amp; it was ſhewed in the beginning of the Chapter, that the deſign of God in preſenting this vaſt creature Leviathan to the view or conſideration of <hi>Job,</hi> was to humble him: for ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lord hath made all things, and can do all things of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and doth them for himſelf, let us lye in the duſt before him, let us take heed of pride, high thoughts, and boaſting words, in any thing we have, and are; let us ſay (as the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.27.) <hi>Where is boaſting?</hi> where is pride? he anſwers, <hi>It is exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</hi> But by what Law? why cannot boaſting come in? is it kept out by the Law of works, by any thing that we have done? No, boaſting would never be ſhut out, if we could do any thing of our ſelves; therefore, ſaith he, this comes to paſs <hi>by the Law of faith,</hi> by caſting our ſelves wholly upon God, both as to our juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and ſalvation. That God doth all things of himſelf, ſhould render us nothing in our ſelves. <hi>Who hath prevented me that I ſhould repay him?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="704" facs="tcp:48669:365"/>
                  <p>The Lord having made theſe uſes of what he had ſaid concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Leviathan, proceeds to a general aſſertion (as was ſaid) in the cloſe of this 11th verſe.</p>
                  <q>Whatſoever is under the whole heaven is mine.</q>

                  <p>Secondly, We may expound this aſſertion, as carrying on the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Argument, or further to prove that no man can prevent the Lord, ſeeing all is his already. <hi>Whatſoever is under the whole heaven is mine</hi> (ſaith he) The creatures are all mine, I challenge all, I lay claim to all; whether therefore I give to one, or take from another, no man hath reaſon to queſtion me, or to ask of me a reaſon, why I did or do ſo; for, all is my own. And when the Lord ſaith, <hi>Whatſoever is under the whole heaven is mine,</hi> his mean-is, not only that all under heaven, but that heaven it ſelf, and all that is in heaven, is his alſo. The Lords Eſtate or Right, is not confined to the things which are under the heaven. So that, when he ſaith, <hi>Whatſoever is under the whole heaven is mine,</hi> he ſaith in effect, all is mine. Thus <hi>Moſes</hi> expoundeth this aſſertion (<hi>Deut.</hi> 10.14.) <hi>Behold, the heaven, and the heaven of heavens is the Lords thy God, the earth alſo, with all that therein is.</hi> The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why the Lord ſpeaks here only of this eſtate under heaven, is becauſe he was diſcourſing with <hi>Job</hi> of this inferiour world, and the furniture of it; and it was enough for him to underſtand, as to the preſent debate, that all under heaven was the Lords: but in truth, not only is the Earth, the Sea, the Air, with all their fulneſs and furniture, the Lords, but the Heaven, and the Heaven of Heavens, is the Lords, with all their beauty and glory.</p>
                  <pb n="705" facs="tcp:48669:365"/>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>The Lord is the great proprietour of all things in this world.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whatſoever is under the whole heaven is the Lords, or all is the Lords. Firſt, by creation, he hath given all things their being. Secondly, all is the Lords by preſervation, he keepeth all things in their being; <hi>Jeſus Chriſt upholds all things by the word of his power (Heb.</hi> 1.3.) that is, by his powerful word. The ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding word which gave all things their being in the beginning, hath hitherto preſerved their being, and will to the end. And not only ſo, but, Thirdly, all things are his in poſſeſſion, the Lord hath all in his hand: In whoſe hand ſoever the things of the world are, they are all in the Lords hand. As <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaid, in his Treaty with the King of <hi>Sodom (Gen.</hi> 14.22.) <hi>I have lift up my hands to the moſt high God, the poſſeſſor of heaven and of earth</hi> (Pſal. 24.1.) <hi>The earth is the Lords, and the fulneſs thereof, the world, and they that dwell therein;</hi> that is, they are all at his diſpoſe. And again, <hi>The world is mine, and the fulneſs thereof,</hi> ſaith the Lord himſelf (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.12.) and therefore, <hi>if I were hungry,</hi> that is, if I needed any thing, <hi>I would not tell thee,</hi> that is, complain to thee, or go a begging to thee, who art but a beggar; I can help my ſelf, and take what and where I will. There is a fourth title, by which all things under heaven are the Lords, even by <hi>Redemption.</hi> The Lord hath reſtored the whole world to a kind of new life, by the death of his Son; <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is the Saviour of all men, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of them which believe</hi> (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10.) All have ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit by redemption; and ſo, whatſoever is under the whole hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the whole Syſtome of heaven and earth, is the Lords by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption; though the ſpecialty of redemption be theirs only, and intended to them only who believe; who as they have a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar portion (a <hi>Benjamins</hi> Meſs) in the grace of redemption, ſo the Lord calleth them his peculiars (<hi>Exod.</hi> 19.5.) <hi>Ye ſhall be a peculiar treaſure unto me, above all people, for all the earth is mine.</hi> And they are called the Lords portion (<hi>Deut.</hi> 32.9.) <hi>The Lords portion is his people,</hi> Jacob <hi>is the lot of his inheritance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus, as all under the whole heaven is the Lords, ſo all is his by a fourfold title, by the titles of creation and ſuſtentation, and poſſeſſion and redemption. All things viſible and inviſible have been created, are ſuſtained and poſſeſſed by him as their great
<pb n="706" facs="tcp:48669:366"/> Lord; and all things viſible have been redeemed by him from preſent periſhing, and a world of them in this world, that they ſhould <hi>never periſh, but have everlaſting life, John</hi> 3.16.</p>
                  <p>From this general Aſſertion, <hi>That whatſoever is under the whole heaven is the Lords,</hi> take theſe following Inferences.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Then <hi>the Devil is a lyar,</hi> a great lyar; for (<hi>Mat.</hi> 4.) in his laſt aſſault againſt Chriſt, he boaſted that he would give him <hi>all the Kingdoms of the earth, and the glory of them,</hi> whereas the truth is, he hath not a ſhoe latchet at his diſpoſe: While the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil ſaith, all is mine, the truth is, nothing is his but a lye, of that he is the father. As he hath not given a being to the leaſt worm; ſo he cannot diſpoſe of the leaſt worm, he is not worth a ſtraw, for all is the Lords.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Hence we learn, <hi>That there is a lying ſpirit in moſt of the children of men, even in all them who look upon any thing they have as their own.</hi> There is a ſenſe in which we have a right to, and a propriety in what we have, and may call it <hi>ours;</hi> but that ſpirit which moves in moſt of the children of men, is a lying ſpirit, when they ſay, this and that is <hi>their own. David (Pſal.</hi> 12.4.) brings in the wicked, ſaying, <hi>With our tongue will we prevail, our lips are our own, who is Lord over us?</hi> What, have not we, who have ſo many Lordſhips, the Lordſhip of our ſelves, the Lordſhip of that little piece of our ſelves, our lips? But were not their lips their own? not, in the ſenſe they ſpake it, as if they were accountable to none for them; for their next word was, <hi>Who is Lord over us?</hi> Thus moſt do, they look upon their lips, and all the members of their body as their own; but what ſaith the Apoſtle (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.20.) <hi>Glorifie God in your body, and in your ſpirit, which are Gods.</hi> And (<hi>verſ.</hi> 19.) <hi>Ye are not your own.</hi> Your body is not your own, but it is the Lords; then much leſs are the things that you have your own; your Land is not your own, nor your cattel your own; the beaſts of the earth are not your own, nor the fiſhes of the Sea your own; nor is a hair of your head your own, nor a pin upon your ſleeve: they are all the Lords. Is it not then a lying ſpirit which poſſeſſeth very many among the children of men, who look upon themſelves, and what they have, as their own? Their houſes and lands are their own, their gold and ſilver are their own; who is Lord over them or theirs? O let ſuch remember, that themſelves, their houſes and lands, their gold and
<pb n="707" facs="tcp:48669:366"/> ſilver are the Lords, and that the Lord ſaith expreſsly, <hi>The ſilver is mine, and the gold is mine (Hag.</hi> 2.8.)</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If all be the Lords, then the Lord is able to ſupply the wants of all who wait upon him, and to ſupply them plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. The Lord ſupplieth the wants of all creatures. The Lord keepeth a great houſe he feedeth all that he hath made, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videth food for Leviathan, <hi>he ſatisfieth every living thing (Pſal.</hi> 145, 16.) and (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 115.16.) <hi>The heaven, even the heavens are the Lords, but the earth hath he given to the children of men;</hi> that is, whatſoever of the earth the children of men, that is, men in common, or mankind, have, the Lord hath given it to them; and ſeing his own children have need of it, ſurely he will not deny it them. The Lord (I ſay) hath given <hi>the earth to the children of men;</hi> and if the Lord hath beſtowed the earth on men, as men, then much more hath he the earth to beſtow upon his own chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Chriſt in his Sermon upon the mount (<hi>Mat.</hi> 6.32.) aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth them of it, <hi>Your heavenly father knoweth that ye have need of theſe things.</hi> Food and cloathing is in your fathers hand, your father is rich, he is rich indeed, and therefore he can ſupply your wants. If children do but remember, that their father hath ſuch and ſuch lands and houſes, they think they ſhall be well provided for; how much more may a godly man ſay, my father hath a great deal of land, the whole earth is his, and therefore I ſhall be provided for? The Apoſtle improves this poſition twice (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.) Firſt, to mak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> uſe of our liberty, <hi>in eating whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is fold in the ſhambles, asking no queſtion for conſcience ſake; for</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the earth is the Lords, and the fullneſs thereof</hi> (verſ. 26.) He makes uſe of it, Secondly, to perſwade us not to abuſe our liberty (<hi>ver.</hi> 28.) <hi>But if any man ſay unto you, this is offered in ſacrifice unto idols, eat not for his ſake that ſhewed it</hi> (do not offend him) <hi>and for conſcience ſake</hi> (do not offend thy ſelf) <hi>The earth is the Lords, and the fullneſs thereof.</hi> As if he had ſaid, why ſhouldſt thou trouble thy ſelf or others, by eating ſuch meat? ſeing there is enough to be had without running ſuch a hazard, and thou mayſt take thy choice all the world over, <hi>for the earth is the Lords.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, This grand Aſſertion carrieth in it great encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to be much in the Lords work: Why? becauſe he is able to give us a good reward. We ſhall not need to fear any loſs of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in doing what we do for him, he can recompence us fully,
<pb n="709" facs="tcp:48669:367"/> for all is his under the whole heaven; he is able to pay us well for any ſervice we do him. <hi>Saul</hi> wondered why the <hi>Benjamites</hi> followed <hi>David</hi> (what's the matter? ſaid he, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22.7.) <hi>Hear ye Benjamites, will the Son of</hi> Jeſſe <hi>give every one of you fields and vineyards, and make you Captains of thouſands, and Captains of hundreds?</hi> Can the Son of <hi>Jeſs</hi> do theſe things for you? It is a wonder that any ſhould ſerve him, that hath nothing to beſtow upon them; but who can wonder that the people of God ſhould ſerve him, and ſtick cloſe to his ſervice, while they do but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that he hath fields and vineyards, the ſilver and the gold, together with all the great offices and preferments, that he hath in his hand. This was the Motive which the Apoſtle uſed to edge his Exhortation (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.5, 8.) <hi>Be ye ſtedfast and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, for as much as ye know, that your labour ſhall not be in vain in the Lord.</hi> He ſaith as much (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8.) <hi>Godlineſs is profitable unto all things, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the promiſe of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.</hi> Godlineſs hath the promiſe of a comfortable portion in this life, as well as of a full one in the life to come.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>Fear not to loſe for Chriſt.</hi> Do not fear to loſe any thing under heaven for Chriſt, for whatſoever is under the whole heaven is Chriſts; he is able to make up all again. We need not wonder at that promiſe which is made by Chriſt, <hi>He that ſuffers loſs of any thing for my name ſake, ſhall receive a hundred-fold, now in this time (Mark.</hi> 10.36.) Not only dot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the Lord promiſe a hundred fold, in ſweet inward contentments in this time, to them who loſe for him; but he is able to ſupply a hundred fold, even in this life, of the things of this life: and as he is able, ſo he will ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fulfill it, according to that promiſe, when he ſees it fit to give, or us fit to receive ſuch enjoyments. O, ſaith one, I may loſe my lands, and I my trade, ſaith another, and I my liberty ſaith a third. As many fear and fly from ſuffering, becauſe of the puniſhment of ſenſe, ſo not a few, becauſe of the puniſhment of loſs; they are in danger of loſing all, and they are not willing to loſe any thing for Chriſt. Now, I may anſwer all, who upon that account, fear of loſs, refuſe to ſuffer for Chriſt, as the Prophet did that King of <hi>Judah</hi> (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25.9.) who, when he had word brought him from the Lord, that he muſt let go the Army of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that he had hired againſt the <hi>Edomites,</hi> preſently objected, <hi>But what
<pb n="708" facs="tcp:48669:367"/> ſhall I do for the hundred talents of ſilver, that I have given to the Army?</hi> The man of God anſwered, <hi>The Lord is able to give thee much more than this:</hi> Do thou obey the Lords command, and do not trouble thy ſelf about the hundred talents, the Lord is able to give thee more than this. This hath been the queſtion of many, when called to ſuffer, <hi>What ſhall we do for the hundred talents?</hi> what ſhall we do for our worldly ſubſtance, and ſubſiſtence? what ſhall we do for a lively-hood? I may ſay as the Prophet then did, the Lord is able to give you abundantly more than what you loſe for him.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, As we ſhould not fear to loſe for the Lord's ſake, ſo <hi>let us not forbear to give for the Lords ſake.</hi> Some are afraid to give for the Lords ſake, to ſupply the neceſſities of their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; but remember, what you give to the poor, you lend to the Lord, and to ſuch a Lord as hath all things under the whole hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for his. If we give, the Lord is able to repay us. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle makes uſe of this very argument (<hi>Phil.</hi> 4.18.19.) <hi>I have all, and abound, I am full, having received of</hi> Epaphroditus, <hi>the things which were ſent from you, an odour of a ſweet ſmell, a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice acceptable, well pleaſing to God.</hi> What follows? <hi>But my God ſhall ſupply all your needs, according to his riches in glory by Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Do not think you ſhall want, becauſe of the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply you give to my wants; no, my God ſhall ſupply your wants or needs, according <hi>to his riches in glory,</hi> that is, according to his rich and glorious grace. There is no need to be ſupplied in the glory of the next life; but there is a glory in rich grace which readily and plentifully ſupplieth all our needs in this life.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, <hi>If all under the whole heaven be the Lords? then all places are the Lords.</hi> This is comfort to thoſe, who are at any time Gods <hi>out-caſts;</hi> he can ſay to any place, as he did to <hi>Moab (Iſa.</hi> 16.4.) <hi>Let mine out-caſts dwell with thee,</hi> &amp;c. All coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries are the Lords, he can make room for his in any part of the world, for all the world is his. The Lord provided a place for the Church (<hi>Rev.</hi> 12.6, 14.) when ſhe was caſt out, <hi>The Church fled into the wilderneſs, where ſhe had a place prepared of God.</hi> The wilderneſs was her troubleſome condition, but the Lord provided a place for her then and there. The Lord can command a place for his any where; if not in one country, yet in another, becauſe all the countries and kingdoms under heaven are his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mean;
<pb n="710" facs="tcp:48669:368"/> he is Lord over all, bleſſed for evermore. Whatſoever is under the whole heaven is his, both in his poſſeſſion, and at his diſpoſition.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, If all that is under the whole heaven be the Lords? then <hi>go to God for all (Phil.</hi> 4.5.) <hi>Let your moderation be known unto all men, the Lord is at hand;</hi> he is at hand <hi>as a Judge</hi> to right you, and he is at hand <hi>as a Father</hi> to provide for you; therefore be careful in nothing, but let your requeſt be made known unto God by prayer and ſupplication. If you would have any thing of the earth, you muſt go to God for it, as well as for heaven it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, If all things under the whole heaven be the Lords? then <hi>whatever good things you have under the whole heaven, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the Lord as the Donor and Giver of them all</hi> (1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.14.) When <hi>David,</hi> together with the Princes and People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> had offered ſo freely towards the building of the Temple, he ſaid, <hi>Lord, who am I, and what is my people? that we ſhould be able to offer ſo willingly after this ſort, for all things come of thee, and of thine own have we given thee.</hi> He acknowledged the Lord as the giver of all, that himſelf and his people had given to the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Tenthly, Is all the Lords? then, <hi>uſe all as the Lords, and not as your own.</hi> Remember you are but Stewards; God hath a title <hi>paramount</hi> to all you have: do not uſe what is yours as your own, but as the Lords; you are but Stewards of the things you have in this world. The Lord rebuked <hi>Iſrael (Hoſ.</hi> 2.8, 9.) for uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their riches, their corn and wine, otherwiſe than he had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed; they did not uſe them as Stewards, they uſed all as Lords, not as the Lords: They thought it was their gold, and their ſilver, and their wine, and their oil, their wool, their flax, and they beſtowed all upon an idol, and prepared all for <hi>Baal.</hi> See what the Lord ſaith in the next verſe, <hi>Therefore will I return and take away my corn in the time thereof, and my wine in the ſeaſon thereof, and will recover my wool and my flax.</hi> All theſe are mine, and you uſe them as your own, and beſtow them upon <hi>Baal.</hi> Thus men beſtow their gold and ſilver upon their luſts, upon their pride and intemperance, upon their revenge and uncleanneſs, yea, to adorn their idols; take heed of applying your poſſeſſions to wrong uſes. God is the Lord of all, and he will have an account
<pb n="711" facs="tcp:48669:368"/> of Lords, as they have of their Stewards, what they have done with all, for they are but Stewards.</p>
                  <p>In the Eleventh place, <hi>Then the Lord may give and take of all that is under heaven, when he pleaſeth, and how he pleaſeth, to whom he pleaſeth, and from whom he pleaſeth.</hi> May not he do what he will with his own? (<hi>Mat.</hi> 20.15.) If he gives to one, he giveth but his own; and if he takes from another, he taketh but his own; if he gives another much, and you but a little, you muſt be quiet and ſubmit, he giveth but his own. If he give much of this worlds good to evil men? if he adorn and beautifie them with all outward bleſſings, who hath any thing to ſay againſt it? what though men, meaſuring things by their own reaſon, ſee no reaſon, yet let them know what he beſtoweth, is of his own, not of any mans poſſeſſion; and if he beſtow great things upon the unworthy, he doth no wrong to thoſe that are worthy, much leſs to thoſe who are as unworthy as they: The benefits he beſtows upon any are no wrong to others. Upon this ground the Lord commanded the Nations quietly to ſubmit to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> King of <hi>Babilon (Jer.</hi> 27.4, 5, 6.) <hi>Thus ſhall ye ſay to your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi> (The Word was given by <hi>Jeremiah</hi> from the Lord to the Meſſengers of ſeveral Princes) <hi>I have made the earth, the man, and the beast that are upon the ground, by my out-ſtretched arm, and by my great power, and have given it unto whomſoever it ſeems meet unto me. And now I have given all theſe lands into the hand of</hi> Nebuchadnezzar, <hi>&amp;c. And the beaſts of the field have I alſo given to ſerve him: and all Nations ſhall ſerve him,</hi> &amp;c. Thus if the Lord gives, he giveth his own, and if he takes all away from any, it is but his own; thus <hi>Job</hi> quieted his ſpirit at firſt, <hi>The Lord hath given, and the Lord hath taken, bleſſed be the name of the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the Twelfth place, If all be the Lords under the whole hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, then, <hi>be ſure you pay your Land-lord your rent.</hi> Shall we live in the Lords houſe, and uſe the Lords land, and not pay him his rent? let us pay the Lord his rent, for we are all Tennants and Tennants at Will. Pay him his rent; you will ſay, what is that? It is the rent of praiſe and obedience; the Lord hath a ſervice due to him for all.</p>
                  <p>In the Thirteenth place, <hi>Let all the godly rejoyce.</hi> All that is under the whole heaven is Gods, it is in the hand of their friend
<pb n="712" facs="tcp:48669:369"/> and father; all their enemies are in the hand of the Lord, their tongues are the Lords, and their power is the Lords, and all they have is in the hand of the Lord; and therefore no wonder if <hi>David</hi> concluded (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 144.15.) <hi>Happy are the people that are in ſuch a caſe, yea, happy is that people whoſe God is the Lord,</hi> for they have him, who is Lord of all, of all under the whole hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, If all be the Lords under the whole heaven, then, <hi>let us above all things labour to aſſure an interest in the Lord.</hi> To be able to ſay the Lord is our God, is the ſureſt way to a worldly eſtate; if we have him who hath all, we have all; as one ſaid, <hi>If God be mine, then all is mine.</hi> 'Tis the happineſs of all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, that God is theirs; <hi>This God is our God, we have waited for him. The Lord, who is our God, is the God of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> Believers appropriate God to themſelves; they do not ſtand talking of gold and of ſilver, of houſes and lands, but, ſay they, <hi>God is our God.</hi> Keep cloſe to God in Chriſt, and he will keep you. You cannot but have enough, when you have God, who hath all things under heaven, yea, and all things in heaven.</p>

                  <p>We have here God ſpeaking, <hi>I</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>will not conceal his parts.</hi> There is a two-fold opinion about the connection or dependance of this verſe.</p>
                  <p>Some joyn it with the former, the eleventh verſe; <hi>Who hath prevented me, that I ſhould repay him? whatſoever is under the whole heaven is mine.</hi> Now, in caſe any one ſhould ſtand forth with that boldneſs as to tell the Lord, he had prevented him, he had been a fore-hand with God; Well, ſaith the Lord,<note place="margin">Si quis me ante vertere, aut ſuperior me eſſe poſſet, ejus laudes utique celebrarem. <hi>Merc.</hi>
                     </note> if any will undertake this, if any man dares affirm, that he hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented me, <hi>I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely proportion,</hi> I will do him no wrong, I will not ſhadow, nor obſcure his worth; I will ſet him forth in his faireſt colours, or paint him to the life, in all that he is, in all that he can ſay, or do, or ſhew himſelf to be in ſuch a conteſt with me, or in his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
<pb n="714" facs="tcp:48669:370"/> me about this matter. And when that's done, I ſhall eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and quickly convince him, or make him both ſee and confeſs, that he is a poor weakling, that he is nothing, or, if any thing, vile, compared with me: For if I do but oppoſe to him the parts, powers, and comlineſs of Leviathan, he will find himſelf over-matched. Thus, I ſay, ſome conceive the Lord referreth to the former words, as promiſing to him right, that ſhould accept the challenge there made, and ſay, that he had prevented God, or had been aforehand with him.</p>

                     </note>Others give it thus, if any man ſhall venture to anſwer my challenge, <hi>I will not conceal his lies</hi> (ſo the word, by us tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>parts,</hi> is rendred, Chap. 11.3.) nor his boaſting words, not the rhetorical ornaments, nor the comely proportion of his ſpeech, in pleading and arguing with me; all which will be found upon trial, to be but lies, vain flouriſhes, and mear ſophiſtical fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacies.</p>
                  <p>But I rather take this verſe as a general Preface to that which the Lord intended further to ſay, in the deſcription of this mighty creature, Leviathan. As if he had ſaid; <hi>O</hi> Job, <hi>that thou mayſt be yet more fully convinced, how unable thou art to deal with this mighty fiſh; and mayſt therein ſee, yet more clearly, how unable thou art to ſtand before my power, who have given both being and power to this creature, I ſhall go on, to give thee a more lively pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, a more particular narrative, a fuller character of him; and, as it were, anatomize this ſea monſter, in all his parts, powers, and proportions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So then, in this context, and forward to the end of the 32d verſe, we have the fourth part of the deſcription of Leviathan, even, by the diſtinct parts of his body, together with the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful powers, effects, and operations that appear in them; as acted by that courage, ſtoutneſs, and greatneſs of ſpirit, with which God have clothed him.</p>
                  <q>I will not conceal his parts.</q>
                  <p>The Hebrew is, <hi>I will not be ſilent about his parts.</hi> And when the Lord ſaith, I will not conceal, nor be ſilent, his meaning is, I will fully,<note place="margin">Meioſis, cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brarem ejus membra. <hi>Druſ.</hi>
                     </note> largely, and evidently declare <hi>the parts, the power, and the comely proportion of Leviathan;</hi> I will view, as it were, all that is moſt obſervable in, and about him; I will do it exactly,
<pb n="715" facs="tcp:48669:370"/> not ſlightly, or perfunctorily, but like an Oratour declare all his excellencies; I will not let ſlip, nor omit any thing that is mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial or conducible to his commendation. So that, when the Lord ſaith, <hi>I will not conceal,</hi> he intends much more than he expreſſeth; As the Prophet alſo did (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 62.1.) when he ſaid, <hi>For Zions ſake will I not hold my peace;</hi> meaning, that he would pour out his heart, and make a loud cry, in prayers and ſupplications for <hi>Zions</hi> ſake. That's the import of his words, <hi>I will not hold my peace:</hi> As alſo, of thoſe (<hi>verſ.</hi> 6.) <hi>Ye that make mention of the Lord,</hi> or, <hi>ye that are the Lords remembrancers</hi> (in the concerns of <hi>Zion) keep not ſilence.</hi> The meaning is, ſpeak much for <hi>Zion.</hi> A man doth not keep ſilence, nor hold his peace, who ſpeaketh only a word or two. But the <hi>Lords remembrancers</hi> muſt ſpeak to the full, much and often; they muſt urge him with many arguments, and plead hard, till he bring forth ſalvation in <hi>Zion.</hi> I urge this Scripture, as parallel to the Text in hand, where the Lord ſaith, <hi>I will not conceal,</hi> when his purpoſe was to ſpeak copiouſly and largely.</p>
                  <p>And here the Lord ſetteth down three things concerning Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viathan, which he will not conceal;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>His parts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>His power.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>His comely proportion.</hi> To theſe three heads, all that can be ſaid of Leviathan is reducible.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I will not conceal his parts</hi> or <hi>members.</hi>

                     </note> This creature is made up of ſeveral heterogeneal parts or members. The word rendred <hi>parts</hi> properly ſignifieth the <hi>bar</hi> or <hi>bolt</hi> of a door, as alſo <hi>the boughs of a tree:</hi> There is a great elegancy in that metaphor, becauſe the members of the body in any creature, are as ſo many boughs ſhot out from the ſtock of a tree. <hi>I will not conceal his parts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, what are the parts which the Lord mentions, or would not conceal?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, The word <hi>parts,</hi> in our language and common ſpeech, ſignifieth the inward abilities, and faculties of any man. We ſay, ſuch a one is a man of excellent parts, or he hath good parts, that is, he is a wiſe man, an underſtanding man, a well-ſpoken man. But here in this place, the word <hi>parts</hi> notes only the limbs, members, and organs of the body, or the ſeveral pieces of the whole compages or frame of the body. Of theſe parts
<pb n="716" facs="tcp:48669:371"/> the Lord ſpeaketh in the following part of the Chapter. And he ſpeaketh,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Of his skin (ver. 13.)</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Of his jaws and teeth (ver. 14.)</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Of his ſcales (ver. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, 16, 17.)</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Of his noſtrils, eyes, and mouth (ver. 18, 19, 20, 21.)</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Of his neck (ver. 22.)</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Of his fleſh all over (ver. 23.)</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, Of his heart (ver. 24.)</p>
                  <p>All theſe, if not more particular parts, the Lord mentions in this Chapter; and therefore he might well ſay, <hi>I will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal his parts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>Nor his power.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Parts</hi> are one thing, and <hi>power</hi> is another. There may be great bodily parts, where there is but little power. That which mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth parts excellent, is when they are full of power, or when out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts are accompanied with inward parts, which are the accompliſhments of them. <hi>I will not conceal his power.</hi>

                  <p>Firſt, In his noſtrils; <hi>By his neefings a light doth ſhine,</hi> in the former part of the 18th verſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, In his eyes; They are <hi>like the eye-lids of the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> in the latter part of the 18th verſe.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, In his mouth; <hi>Out of his mouth go burning lamps, and ſparks of fire leap out</hi> (ver. 19.) Heat riſeth out of the vital power of any creature: Leviathans heat is ſo great, that it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>fire;</hi> and from thence, <hi>ſmoke goeth out of his noſtrils, as out of a ſeething-pot, or cauldron</hi> (ver. 20.) yea, <hi>his breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth</hi> (ver. 21.) All theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions ſhew the mighty heat within him.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, In his neck (ver. 22.) <hi>In his neck remaineth ſtrength.</hi> He hath not only a neck, but a ſtrong neck.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, In his heart (ver. 24.) <hi>His heart is as firm as a ſtone, yea, as hard as a piece of the nether mill-ſtone.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="717" facs="tcp:48669:371"/>
                  <p>Sixthly, Such is his power, that he is terrible to others (v. 25.) <hi>When he raiſeth up himſelf, the mighty are afraid.</hi> Yea,</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, Such is his power, That nothing can annoy him, <hi>the ſword of him that layeth at him cannot hold, the ſpear, the dart, nor the habergeon</hi> (ver. 26.)</p>
                  <p>And Laſtly, Such is his power, That <hi>he maketh the deep to boil like a pot, he maketh the ſea like a pot of ointment: He maketh a path to ſhine after him: one would think the deep to be hoary</hi> (ver. 31, 32.) Thus the Lord deſcribes, not only the parts, but the power of Leviathan. And in the Hebrew, the word is plural, <hi>powers,</hi> which intimates the greatneſs of his power, or that he is powerful in every part, each part being full of power.</p>
                  <p>There is a two-fold power. Firſt, of ſtrength. Secondly, of authority. Leviathan hath no power of authority, though he be called <hi>a King over all the children of pride.</hi> But he hath a mighty power of <hi>ſtrength;</hi> That's here intended, <hi>I will not conceal his parts, nor his power,</hi>
                     <q>Nor his comely proportion.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Or <hi>the grace of his diſpoſition.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Non tacebo gratiam diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitionis ejus, <hi>i. e.</hi> dicam, quam concinnè membra ejus compoſita ſunt.</note> That's the emphaſis of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew. There is a two-fold diſpoſition;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Of the mind, which we commonly call a mans <hi>diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Of the body, which conſiſts in the right placing of the parts, their ſymetry order and proportion. Hence we tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate fully, <hi>His comely proportion.</hi> Maſter <hi>Broughton</hi> renders it, <hi>The grace of his frame,</hi> that is, the due compoſition and feature of all the members of his body.</p>
                  <p>Some expound theſe words <hi>Ironically;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ironicè</hi> dictum; cum enim hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifica ſit imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſſimi monſtri diſpoſitio, &amp; conformatio totius corporis, nihil in illo gratiae, &amp; ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſtatis eſſe poteſt. <hi>Caje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan.</hi>
                     </note> As if when the Lord ſaith, <hi>I will not conceal his comely proportion,</hi> his meaning were <hi>his monſtruous uncomlineſs.</hi> But by their leave; how great, or vaſt ſoever any creature is, there may be a comelineſs, and proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or a due diſpoſition of the members of his body, as well as of a leſſer, or little one. There are three things which make up the compleat natural comelineſs of a creature. Firſt, Diſtinction of members; there muſt be parts. Secondly, Strength, for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of the parts. Thirdly, A due proportion of the parts one towards another; that's it which we properly call <hi>feature.</hi> There may be beauty, but no comelineſs, without a due diſpoſition or
<pb n="718" facs="tcp:48669:372"/> proportion of parts; and where there is a due proportion of parts, there is comelineſs, how great ſoever any creature is. All theſe concur in Leviathan; Firſt, parts; Secondly, power; Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, proportion; and therefore he is, though a Monſter for big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, yet a comely creature. <hi>I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely proportion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence obſerve, Firſt;
<q>God hath beſtowed excellent parts, power, and proportion, upon all his creatures, eminently upon ſome of them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whatſoever the Lord made, he made it (as 'tis ſaid) <hi>in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, weight and meaſure,</hi> that is, exactly. The fowls of the Air, the beaſts and creeping things of the Earth, the fiſhes of the Sea; all of them according to their kind, have excellent parts, power, and comelineſs of proportion. <hi>David</hi> ſpeaking this in general, brings it down to the particular under hand (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.24.) <hi>O Lord, how manifold are thy works</hi> (that is, the works of Creation) <hi>in wiſdom haſt thou made them all</hi> (all of them, even to the very Fly, are wiſely made, in wiſdome haſt thou made them all) <hi>the earth is full of thy riches,</hi> verſ. 15. <hi>So is this great and wide Sea, wherein are things creeping innumerable, both ſmall and great beaſts; there go the Ships, there is that Leviathan, whom thou haſt made to play therein.</hi> Leviathan is made in wiſdom, or wiſely made; the wiſdom, as well as the power of the great God is viſible, in the making and compoſure of him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Obſerve;
<q>God is pleaſed to ſet forth, and in ſetting forth, the particular excellencies of natural creatures.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I will not</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>conceal his parts,</hi> &amp;c. God (who is without parts) is ſeen in the parts of every creature, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hath not concealed their parts. <hi>Men do not light a candle</hi> (ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.15.) <hi>and put it under a buſhel, but on a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſtick.</hi> God hath lighted a candle for us to ſee himſelf by, in making the parts of every creature, and he hath put that light on as many candleſticks, as he hath made diſcourſes or diſcoveries of them in any part of the Scriptures; and that he hath done emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently in the latter part of this Book of <hi>Job.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now if God be thus pleaſed in declaring the parts of natural
<pb n="721" facs="tcp:48669:372"/> creatures, <hi>How much more is he pleaſed in declaring the parts and excellencies, or thoſe moſt excellent and amiable parts of the new creature!</hi> That is, the excellencies of man in his inner man. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſaith (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.10, 11.) <hi>He delighteth not in the ſtrength of the horſe, he taketh not pleaſure in the legs of a man. The Lord taketh pleaſure in them that fear him, in thoſe that hope in his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;</hi> and with them he is much taken: He is infinitely more pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſpeaking of their parts, and powers, and comely proportion, than in thoſe of <hi>Leviathan,</hi> or of any the moſt comely and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful creature in the world. Jeſus Chriſt could not conceal the parts, the power, not the comely proportion of his Spouſe, that is, of his Church (<hi>Cant.</hi> 4.1, 2, 3, 4.) <hi>Behold, thou art fair my love, behold, thou art fair, thou haſt doves eyes within thy locks; thy hair is as a flock of goats that appear from mount</hi> Gilead; <hi>thy teeth are like a flock of ſheep, that are even ſhorn,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Thy lips are like a thread of ſcarlet; thy ſpeech is comely; thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate within thy locks; thy neck is like the tower of</hi> David; <hi>thy breaſts are like two young roes, that are twins, which feed among the Lillies.</hi> Thus Jeſus Chriſt, you ſee, was ſo far from concealing, that he gave his divine rhetorick full ſcope to depaint all the lineaments, parts, powers, and comely proportion of his Spouſe, the Church. Jeſus Chriſt was ſo raviſht with the beauty which himſelf had put upon the Church, that like an amorous woo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, he could not (if I may ſo ſpeak) contain himſelf from cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up her comely proportion. The rareſt bodily beauty takes the heart, and affects the eye of Chriſt, no more than the gaſtly appearance of a rotting carcaſe, unleſs he ſee ſpiritual beauty there too; and where he ſees that, he is highly pleaſed, though the body, where ſuch a ſoul lodges, hath an appearance as little attractive or deſirable, as that of a rotting carcaſe.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Conſider the reaſon why the Lord inſiſts ſo much in declaring the parts and powers of Leviathan; the reaſon was, that God might declare his own power: it was not for Leviathans ſake that God declared his parts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but that he might declare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in Leviathan.</p>
                  <pb n="722" facs="tcp:48669:373"/>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>The parts, powers, and comely proportions of the creature, clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evidence the excellencies of God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Lord chiefly proclaimed his own name, when he proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the name of Leviathan (<hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20.) <hi>The inviſible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly ſeen, being underſtood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead.</hi> The unſeen God hath made all things, that he may be ſeen in them. When he makes a Comment upon his own works, why is it? but that he may make a Comment upon himſelf, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound his own glory in them. And as the excellencies of the Lord are ſeen in the works of creation, ſo in the works of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; and he hath therefore made ſo many declarations of them to us, that his power, wiſdom, and juſtice may ſhine through them to us (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 75.1.) <hi>That thy name is neer, thy wondrous works declare.</hi> And he ſaid to <hi>Pharaoh (Exod.</hi> 9.16.) <hi>For this cauſe have I raiſed thee up, for to ſhew in thee my power, and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth.</hi> All that the Lord doth to, or in the creature, is to get himſelf a name, and a glory; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us give God the glory of his power, wiſdom and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in all his works.<note place="margin">Negare Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganus Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um poteſt; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gare Deum om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotentem non poteſt. <hi>Auguſt.</hi> ſer. <hi>139.</hi> de Temp.</note> It was the ſaying of one of the Ancients, <hi>A Pagan may deny that there is a Chriſt, but a Pagan cannot deny Almighty God.</hi> A Pagan may deny Chriſt, for that's meerly mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of faith; but ſenſe will lead a Pagan to believe there is a God, or ſome omnipotent power that hath wrought all theſe things. If we ſee a ſtream, <hi>that</hi> aſſures us there is a Spring or Fountain; if we ſee a goodly Palace built, <hi>that</hi> aſſures us it had a builder, a maker. And if the ſtream be full, what is the fountain? If the Palace built be great and magnificent, how great, how magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent was the builder! <hi>Every houſe</hi> (as the Author to the Hebrews ſaid upon another occaſion, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.4.) <hi>is builded by ſome man, but he that built all things is God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Seeing the Lord is pleaſed to read ſuch a natural Phyloſophy Lecture upon this creature, we may take this Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation from it.</p>
                  <q>
                     <pb n="723" facs="tcp:48669:373"/>God would have man know the parts and powers of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</q>
                  <p>Why doth the Lord in this book, ſpeak at large of them, and of their powers, but that we may take notice of them, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them? or that we ſhould ſearch and ſtudy them? What the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeaks concerning the works of providence, is true of the Lords works in nature (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 111.2.) <hi>The works of the Lord are great.</hi> And (<hi>verſ.</hi> 4.) <hi>He hath made his wonderful works to be remembred;</hi> that is, that they ſhould be ſpoken of and memoriz'd. And therefore having ſaid at the beginning of the ſecond verſe, <hi>The works of the Lord are great,</hi> he adds in the cloſe of it, <hi>Sought out of all them that have pleaſure therein. His work is honourable and glorious,</hi> &amp;c. The works of God are to be ſearched to the bottom (though their bottom cannot be found) by all thoſe that have pleaſure, and delight either in God, or in his works; and they therefore ſearch them out alſo, becauſe they encreaſe and better their knowledge of God the Creator, by encreaſing and better<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their knowledge about the creature.</p>
                  <p>From the whole verſe we may infer,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, If God will not conceal the parts, the power, and comli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his creatures, <hi>then let not us conceal the power, the glory, and the excellency of God:</hi> Yea, let us with heart and tongue declare the glorious perfections of God, how holy, how juſt, how wiſe, how merciful, how patient and long-ſuffering a God he is. When God makes the creature known to us, he would much more have us know himſelf, and make him known. <hi>Davids</hi> heart was ſet upon this duty (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.14.) <hi>Thou haſt lifted me up from the gates of death, that I may ſhew forth all thy praiſe, in the gates of the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Sion.</hi> As if he had ſaid, This, O Lord, was thy deſign in <hi>lifting me up from the gates of death,</hi> that is, from deadly dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, or killing diſeaſes, that I might declare thy praiſe in <hi>Sions</hi> gates, or, that I might declare how praiſe-worthy thou art to all who come into the gates of <hi>Sion.</hi> And again (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 118.17.) <hi>I ſhall not die, but live, and declare the works of the Lord.</hi> In the 40th <hi>Pſalm,</hi> which is a Prophecy of Chriſt, he ſpeaks in the words of the Text (<hi>verſ.</hi> 10.) <hi>I have not hid thy righteouſneſs within my heart, I have declared thy faithfulneſs and thy ſalvation, I have not concealed thy loving kindneſs and thy truth from the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.</hi>
                     <pb n="724" facs="tcp:48669:374"/> As the Lord ſaith here concerning Leviathan, <hi>I will not conceal his parts,</hi> ſo ſaith the Prophet, <hi>I will not conceal his loving kindneſs and truth,</hi> &amp;c. Which, as it is moſt true of Chriſt, whoſe work it was to do ſo, as alſo the end of all his works, ſo it ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth what we ought to do, and what ſhould be the end of all our works, not to conceal the righteouſneſs and goodneſs of God, but declare them in the great congregation. And as Chriſt declared the glory of the Father, ſo ſhould we the glory of Chriſt. We read the Church engaged in this. As I ſhewed before, Chriſt could not conceal the parts of the Church, ſo the Church could not conceal the parts of Chriſt (<hi>Cant.</hi> 5.9.) There the queſtion is put to the Church; <hi>What is thy beloved more than an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other beloved, that thou doſt thus charge us?</hi> The Church being asked this queſtion, will not conceal the parts, nor the power, nor the comely proportion of Chriſt her Beloved, but gives a copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Narrative of his gracious excellencies (<hi>verſ.</hi> 10.) <hi>My Beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefeſt among ten thouſand; his head is as moſt fine gold, his locks are buſhy, and black as a Raven; his eyes are as the eyes of Doves by the rivers of waters, waſhed with milk, and fitly ſet; his cheeks are as a bed of ſpices, as ſweet flowers; his lips like Lillies, dropping ſweet ſmelling myrrh; his hands are as gold rings, ſet with Beryle; his belly is as bright Ivory, overlaid with Saphyres; his legs are as pillars of marble, ſet upon ſockets of fine gold; his countenance is as</hi> Lebanon, <hi>excellent as the Cedars; his mouth is ſweet, yea, he is altogether lovely. This is my beloved, and this is my friend, O daughters of Jeruſalem.</hi> Thus, as Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed not the parts of the Church, ſo the Church concealed not the parts, the power, and comely proportion of Chriſt. And did we more conſider who Chriſt is, and what he is, both in himſelf, and unto us, we ſhould be more, both in admiring within our ſelves, and in reporting to others, his parts, his power, and come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proportion.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If God hath not concealed the knowledge of his creatures from us, if he hath not concealed the parts, &amp;c. of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viathan from us, <hi>Then certainly he will not conceal the knowledge of himſelf, and of his Son, from us.</hi> We may get to heaven, or be ſaved, though we know not the creatures thus diſtinctly; but without the knowledge of God in Chriſt, we know no ſalvation (<hi>Acts</hi> 4.12.) If therefore the Lord hath acquainted us thus parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
<pb n="725" facs="tcp:48669:374"/> with the knowledge of the creatures, which is an inferior and not ſo neceſſary a knowledge, doubtleſs he hath acquainted us with the knowledge of himſelf, which is altogether neceſſary. <hi>This is life eternal, to know thee the only true God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Deus non defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit in neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riis.</note> 
                     <hi>and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent (John</hi> 17.3.) It is an uſeful knowledge to know the creature, to know the Leviathan; but it is of abſolute neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to know God the Father, Son and Spirit. God hath not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed himſelf from us, nor his will from us, neither what he would have us do and believe, nor what he will do for us. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> could ſay to the Church at <hi>Epheſus, I have not ſhunned to declare to you the whole counſel of God (Acts</hi> 20.27.) The Lord hath not ſhunned to declare his counſel for our dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, for our inſtruction, for our caution, and for our conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; he will not conceal the knowledge of himſelf from us, in what is needful for us to know unto ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>The Lord having thus prefaced his purpoſe to declare the parts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of Leviathan, comes in the next words to declare his parts.</p>

                  <p>That is, his garment. The word rendred <hi>face</hi> is redundant. As to flie from the face of a man, is to flie from a man; and to flie from the face of the ſword, is no more than to flie from the ſword. The face of any thing ſtrictly taken, is the ſuperficies of a thing, or that which is uppermoſt. The face of the earth is the upper part of the earth, not the whole earth. But here the face of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viathans garment, is his whole garment.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, Some learned Interpreters are of opinion, that the Sea it ſelf is here intended by this garment, becauſe the Whale doth, as it were, wrap himſelf in the waters, as we do in a garment. The Sea is his garment, ſaith Mr. <hi>Broughton;</hi> who can take that from him, and bring him to Land?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Others conceive, that by this garment, we are to underſtand, the skin of the Leviathan. The natural garment of every creature is his skin. At firſt mans, not only natural, but only garment, was his skin, and afterward his artificial garment was made of skins. <hi>Who can diſcover the skin of the Leviathan?</hi> that is, who can fley off his skin, and ſo ſtrip him of his garment?</p>

                     </note>Thirdly, Others who interpret this garment, <hi>the skin,</hi> yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it ſpoken, not of the skin of his whole body, but the skin about his face, and which hangeth over his eyes, which no man is ſo hardy (unleſs he be fool-hardy) as to open and take away.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Some take theſe words as a proverbial ſpeech, who can take away a piece of his skin, or touch his skin? As we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſay of a proud and wrathful man, who dares touch him, or pull off ſo much as a ſingle hair from his beard?</p>
                  <p>I ſhall pitch upon the ſecond interpretation, that by the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Leviathan is meant his skin, which is his natural gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. There are many remarkable things ſpoken afterwards in this Chapter, about the skin of Leviathan; Here 'tis called his garment.</p>
                  <p>Whence note;
<q>God hath given every creature ſome kind of garment or covering.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Whale hath his garment; he could not abide the water without it. All trees and plants have a garment, the rind or bark; they could not abide the air without it. Every beaſt and bird hath a garment; they could not abide either heat or cold without it. 'Tis ſaid of man in the ſtate of innocency, that he was naked (<hi>Gen.</hi> 2.18.) <hi>And the man and the woman were both naked, and were not aſhamed:</hi> yet they were not quite naked, they had a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural garment, though not an artificial one, their skin; yea, they had a better natural garment than their skin, their innocency, and that was the reaſon, <hi>why they were not aſhamed.</hi> Since the Fall, mans natural garment is not enough to keep him from either cold or ſhame, he muſt have an artificial garment over that; nor is any artificial garment, how thick, or rich, or coſtly, or faſhionable ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, enough to keep him from ſhame, he muſt have a ſpiritual one; he muſt (as the Apoſtle exhorts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.14.) <hi>Put on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> he muſt <hi>put on the new man, which after God is created in righteouſneſs and true holineſs (Eph.</hi> 4.24.) elſe he hath reaſon to be aſhamed. All are naked, till they put on this garment, Chriſt and his Graces. And they that have put on this garment, ſhall be cloathed with the garment of joy and glory. Being cloathed thus, we ſhall not be found naked, as the Apoſtles word is (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.3.) The Lord hath beſtowed a garment upon
<pb n="727" facs="tcp:48669:375"/> every creature, and upon man, garments of beauty and glory. <hi>Who can diſcover the face of his garment?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>Or who can come to him with his double bridle?</q>
                  <p>There is much contending about the meaning of theſe words, or what is meant by this double bridle; but I ſhall not make any ſtay about it.</p>
                  <p>The text may be read thus: <hi>Who can come within his double bridle.</hi> The <hi>Geneva</hi> tranſlation is near ours; <hi>Who can come to him with a double bridle?</hi> But what is this double bridle?</p>

                     <hi>Who can come to his double bridle?</hi> or into the doubling of his bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle? As the verdure or greenneſs of graſs is put for green graſs, ſo (ſay ſome) the duplicature or doubling of his bridle, is nothing elſe but his double bridle, that is, his jaws or mouth, which have ſome reſemblance to a bridle when they are opened, or at their end. Now according to this reading, the meaning is, who dares come within his lips or jaws, which look like a double bridle? Surely no man dares make ſuch an adventure, ſeeing his jaws are ſo vaſt, or wide, and terrible, that it may even ſtrike a man of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage with terror, or into a fit of trembling to look into them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Others (becauſe the jaws are ſpoken of afterwards) underſtand this double bridle, of any thing which man may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to put into his jaws to ſubdue him with; as if it had been ſaid, who can coerce or bridle him, though he have never ſo ſtrong a bridle, though he have a <hi>double bridle?</hi> The word ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>bridle,</hi> properly ſignifies the <hi>reine of a bridle.</hi>

Thus the Relative <hi>His</hi> doth not reſpect Leviathan, but the man who comes to bridle him: And this is moſt probable, becauſe, if by the double bridle we underſtand the jaws of Leviathan, this would be the ſame with what is ſpoken plainly in the next words.</p>

Yea, <hi>David</hi> would have us ſay ſo unto God (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.3.) <hi>Say unto God</hi> (that is, acknowledge with admiration) <hi>how terrible art thou in thy works!</hi> And (<hi>ver.</hi> 5.) <hi>Come and ſee the works of God; he is ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible in his doings toward the children of men.</hi> Yea, God is terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his own people (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.35.) <hi>O God! thou art terrible out of thy holy places,</hi> that is, out of the Church and Church aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies: the Lord many times declares himſelf very terribly in thoſe ſacred aſſemblies. How terrible was God in his Church, when he devoured <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> with fire, for offering ſtrange fire before him, which he commanded not! (<hi>Levit.</hi> 10.1, 2.) How terrible was the Lord out of his Church, when he ſtruck <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> dead! (<hi>Acts</hi> 5.5, 10.) how ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible was the Lord out of his holy place, the Church, to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians!</hi> concerning whom the Apoſtle ſaith (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.30.) <hi>For this cauſe</hi> (that is, their unworthy partaking of the Lords Supper) <hi>many are weak and ſickly among you, and many ſleep.</hi> God deals terribly with thoſe who are not regardful of him, who prepare not themſelves with due and reverential reſpect to his holineſs, for holy duties. <hi>He is a jealous God, and he will not hold them guiltleſs</hi> (that is, he will hold them very guilty, or deal with them as with guilty perſons) <hi>who take his Name in vain</hi> (Exod. 20.7.) When the Law was given, <hi>ſo terrible was the ſight,</hi> that <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> ſaid, <hi>I exceedingly fear and quake</hi> (Heb. 12.21.) The Lord appeared thus terrible at the giving of the Law, to ſhew how terrible he will be to ſinners, who tranſgreſs the Law, and repent not of, nor turn from their ſins and tranſgreſſions; yea, the Lord (for their trial) ſhews himſelf very terrible to good men, to broken-hearted and repenting ſinners. <hi>Heman</hi> had long and ſad experience of this (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 88.15.) <hi>I am afflicted, and ready to dye from my youth up: while I ſuffer thy terrours, I am diſtracted.</hi> And for this <hi>Job</hi> made that grievous complaint (<hi>Chap.</hi> 6.4.) <hi>The arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poiſon whereof drinketh up my ſpirit, the terrours of God do ſet themſelves in array
<pb n="730" facs="tcp:48669:377"/> against me.</hi> Now if the Lord make ſuch a terrible war upon Saints, if he terrifie them, even till he hath diſtracted them; how will he draw up his terrours as an army, or his army of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, in battle array againſt the wicked and ungodly! How often doth the Lord expreſs himſelf by terrible things againſt ſuch? As he ſometimes deſtroyeth ſinners ſecretly, or without any appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rare: of terrour (<hi>Hoſea</hi> 5.12.) <hi>I will be unto</hi> Ephraim <hi>as a moth.</hi> So often openly, he comes upon them as a Lion, or as a Bear, (<hi>Lament.</hi> 3.10.) <hi>He was unto me as a Bear lying in wait, and as a Lion in ſecret places.</hi> The Lion and Bear often lye cloſe, and in ſecret places, to wait for their prey; but they no ſooner get them within their reach or danger, but they riſe up and devour them openly.</p>
                  <p>Again, if we are afraid to meddle with terrible things? how ſhould we fear to meddle with ſin! Sin hath terrible teeth, it will bite like a Serpent (<hi>Prov.</hi> 23.32.) and tear like a Lion. 'Tis ſin that maketh all things terrible to us. God himſelf is not ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, but as we are ſinners: ſin hath made all things terrible, and troubleſome to us that are ſo. The teeth of Leviathan had not been terrible to man, if man had not ſinned againſt God. <hi>His teeth are terrible round about.</hi>

                     <hi>Beza</hi> ſeems to object from this part of the deſcription of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viathan, that the Whale cannot be meant by Leviathan, becauſe the Whale hath no teeth.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, Firſt, Though Whales, catcht by our Sea-men, have no teeth properly taken, yet they have ſomewhat which is Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical to teeth, they have that in their mouths, which is as terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as teeth.</p>

                  <p>Now as Leviathan is armed with teeth, as offenſive weapons, to hurt others, and to be a terrour to them, ſo with deſenſive armes to ſecure himſelf from hurt, as it followeth,

                  <p>In theſe three verſes Leviathan is deſcribed. Firſt, By the confidence which he hath in his ſcales; they are <hi>his pride,</hi> being like bucklers of braſs. Secondly, By the natural cloſeneſs of his ſcales; ſo cloſe they are, as if ſealed, <hi>that no air can come between them.</hi> Thirdly, By the indiſſolubleneſs of his ſcales; they are joyned ſo faſt one to another, <hi>that they cannot be ſundred.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>His ſcales are his pride,</hi> that is, he is proud of his ſcales. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever any man is proud of, may be called his pride.

Leviathan's ſcales are his pride, that is, he is proud of his ſcales.</p>
                  <p>Here again it is objected, as before about teeth, The Whale hath no ſcales, therefore Leviathan cannot be the Whale. The learned <hi>Bochartus</hi> inſiſts much upon this argument againſt the Whale, proving alſo by many authorities (which is clear to ſight in thoſe carkaſſes of Crocodiles which are among us) that the Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codile hath great and ſtrong ſcales, and thoſe very cloſely laid, or joyned together.

And he adds, Thirdly, That though <hi>Nearchus</hi> ſhould have ſaid, that himſelf had ſeen ſuch a Whale, yet little credit were to be given him, he being an Author of no good credit. Theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, I confeſs, may ſomewhat weaken the teſtimony of <hi>Nearchus;</hi> yet I ſee no reaſon, why they ſhould utterly infringe and diſable it.

And if there be any truths in his writings, as, I ſuppoſe, no man will deny, but there are many; then why this report of a Whale, or mighty fiſh, of that kind, with great ſcales, may not be reckoned among the truths contained in his writings, rather than among the lies, let the Reader judge.</p>
                  <p>Now though it be queſtioned, what animal this Leviathan is? yet 'tis out of queſtion, that he hath ſcales upon him, or that which amounts to ſcales; For (ſaith the Lord) <hi>His ſcales are his pride.</hi>

                  <p>Hence note, Firſt;
<q>There is a kind of pride in brutes and irrational creatures.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Pride ſtrictly taken, is proper to man; yet there is more than a ſhadow of pride in brutes. Even as a man is proud of fine new cloaths, ſo is a horſe of his trappings; or as a man is proud of a ſtrong gliſtering ſhield, ſo is Leviathan of his ſcales. And I may ſafely ſay, that as ſome beaſts are <hi>proudiſh,</hi> ſo all proud men, ſo far as they are proud, are <hi>brutiſh.</hi> It is not for want of grace only, but for want of a due exerciſe of reaſon, that any man is proud.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Note;
<q>Extraordinary attainments or injoyments, are occaſions of pride.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Why are Leviathans ſcales his pride? 'Tis becauſe they are ſo ſtrong and cloſe, that he thinks himſelf ſafe from all injuries un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their ſhelter. The word properly ſignifyeth a buckler of molten braſs. They who are armed with ſuch a defenſive wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, fear neither ſword nor ſpear. Any great injoyments or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments, are occaſions of pride. The Peacock is proud of his feathers, and the horſe of his ſtrength; and men are proud of their riches and worldly abundance (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.17.) <hi>Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not high-minded, nor truſt in uncertain riches.</hi> Some good men, no ſooner get a few golden ſcales, or their ſcales a little gilded, but they begin to be proud; therefore the Apoſtle gave <hi>Timothy</hi> that charge, to warn ſuch rich men as profeſſed the true faith of the Goſpel, to take heed of high-mindedneſs. And as men are apt to be proud of their riches, ſo are women of their beauty, and the learned of their knowledge, and the wiſe of their underſtanding, and great men of their power, and godly men (if they have but gifts beyond their brethren) are apt to be proud of them: And as ſome are proud of the gifts given them by God, ſo many are proud of the gifts given by them to men, I mean, of their good deeds or works of charity. <hi>Salvation</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.9.) <hi>is not of works, leaſt any man ſhould boaſt.</hi> If ſalvation were by working (either by works of grace, or gracious works, towards God, or works of charity towards men) men would be boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which is properly the work of pride. Again, men are very
<pb n="734" facs="tcp:48669:379"/> apt to be proud of their priviledges. The Nation of the Jews, how proud were they of that priviledge, that they were <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> children, that they had the Law and Temple: Whence the Apoſtle left that ſerious admonition to the Gentiles (<hi>Rom.</hi> 11.20.) <hi>Becauſe of unbelief they were broken off, and thou ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt by faith; be not high minded, but fear.</hi> Do not pride your ſelves in your priviledges as they did, leſt you alſo be broken off as they are. Laſtly, ſome have been proud, even of their graces; that of the Apoſtle argueth it (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6, 7.) <hi>Who hath made thee to differ?</hi> (thou haſt grace, and another hath none; who hath made this difference between thee and him? hath not God?) <hi>what hast thou, that thou haſt not received? why then dost thou boaſt as if thou hadst not received it?</hi> Even they that have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived grace, are in danger of boaſting, as if they had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it. I may ſay, as of all proud men, ſo of all men, who are but toucht with pride, as here it is ſaid of Leviathan, <hi>Their ſcales</hi> (ſome attainments or other) <hi>are their pride.</hi> And hence we may infer, <hi>If great attainments are an occaſion of pride;</hi> then</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Let us pray for an humble heart in high injoyments and attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> If you have ſtrong ſcales, much ſtrength about you, or in you, beg hard for humility; be not like Leviathan, let not your ſcales be your pride. <hi>His ſcales are his pride,</hi>

So far are they oftentimes from cleaving together, in duty to God and man, like the ſcales of Leviathan, that they hang together (as we ſay) like ropes of ſand. The Evangeliſt <hi>Luke</hi> ſpeaks of a time (<hi>Acts</hi> 4.32.) When all believers were like the ſcales of Leviathan, <hi>Then the multitude of them that believed</hi> (that is, all they that believed) <hi>were of one heart, and of one ſoul.</hi> Here they were not only joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, like the ſcales of the Leviathan, but they were joyned, as if they were all but one ſcale. Godly men ſhould carry it towards one another, as members of the ſame body, and acted by the ſame ſpirit. They who have relation to thoſe <hi>ſeven ones</hi> mentioned (<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.4, 5, 9.) ſhould labour to be one, ſhould be found endeavouring (as 'tis there ſaid, <hi>ver.</hi> 3.) <hi>To keep the unity of the ſpirit, in the bond of peace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Further, by way of alluſion. The luſts of carnal men in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, are like the ſcales of Leviathan, ſticking ſo cloſe to them, and one to another, that the Spirit of God, in the Miniſtery of
<pb n="737" facs="tcp:48669:381"/> his word finds no paſſage between, till he makes one; yea, hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart, obſtinacy and impenitency are expreſſed by this word (<hi>Lam.</hi> 3.65.) <hi>Give them, O Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>hardneſs of heart, thy curſe unto them. Give them ſorrow of heart;</hi> ſo our tranſlation renders it. The <hi>Hebrew</hi> is, <hi>Give them a ſhield upon their heart.</hi> The word is the very ſame, which is here tranſlated <hi>ſcales,</hi> the ſcales of Leviathan being as ſo many ſhields, ſo ſtrong and thick, that nothing can enter. It is ſad, when we have ſcales on our eyes. It was ſaid of <hi>Saul,</hi> when in that viſion he was ſtricken blind, that before he received his ſight, ſcales fell from his eyes. <hi>Ananias</hi> being ſent to him, ſaid (<hi>Acts</hi> 9.17.) <hi>Brother</hi> Saul, <hi>the Lord (even Jeſus that appeared unto thee in the way as thou cameſt) hath ſent me, that thou mighteſt receive thy ſight, and be filled with the holy Ghoſt; and immediately there fell from his eyes, as it had been ſcales,</hi> &amp;c. All men naturally have ſcales on their eyes. It is ſad to have a ſcale on the eye, any thing that doth hinder the ſight of ſpiritual things; but how ſad is it to have ſcales on the heart alſo! To all impenitent perſons, their luſts are as ſo many ſcales and ſhields upon their hearts; and they have ſo many ſcales upon their hearts, and thoſe ſuch hard ones, that nothing but an Almighty power can make entrance or impreſſion. None are in ſo much danger, as they that are fenced and armed with theſe ſcales. It is beſt for man to open a naked breaſt, to receive every ſtroke which the ſword of the Spirit, the Word of God, makes upon him.</p>

                     </note> was Levia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans terrible head; the firſt in this, is the power of his brain.

That's the reaſon (I ſuppoſe) why they ſay neeſing is a good ſign in prayer.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Both they and others ſay, <hi>Neeſing is a good ſign in a ſick man.</hi> We ſay commonly, <hi>Neeſing is a ſign of health,</hi> it ſhews a vigour and quickneſs in the natural ſpirits, reſiding <hi>in the brain.</hi>

The word by which the Whale is expreſſed in Latine, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies this action, or, his ſpouting out water; and by theſe ſpoutings or neeſings, we may ſay (as it followeth in the Text)
<q>A light doth ſhine.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Becauſe the water which he ſpouts up into the Air, with a great and vehement force, meeting, and as it were, mingling with the light there, looks like light, and hath a great brightneſs in it; ſo that this action of Leviathan, and the effect or concomitant of it, is as applicable to the Whale as to the Crocodile.</p>
                  <q>And his eyes are like the eye-lids of the morning, <hi>or,</hi> like the dawning of the day.</q>
                  <p>So we tranſlate theſe words (<hi>Job</hi> 3.9.) <hi>Let it not</hi> (that is, let not the night in which I was conceived) <hi>ſee the dawning of the day,</hi> or (as the Margin hath it) <hi>the eye-lids of the morning.</hi> Levia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans eyes are ſaid to be like the <hi>eye-lids of the morning,</hi> becauſe of the lightſomeneſs of them. Chriſt ſaith (<hi>Mat.</hi> 6.22.) <hi>The light of the body is the eye.</hi> We may call it ſo in a double reſpect. Firſt, becauſe the eye is the moſt lightſom part of the body, or hath moſt light in it. Secondly, becauſe the eye gives or lets in light to the whole body. They that want eyes, or their eye-ſight, dwell in darkneſs. The eyes of Leviathan are not only light in themſelves,<note place="margin">Palpebrae pro oculis, meto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymicè ſumun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</note> but <hi>are like the eye-lids</hi> (that is, eyes) <hi>of the morning.</hi> But wherein doth this likeneſs conſiſt? I anſwer, in two things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, His eyes are very great, in proportion to his head and body.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, His eyes are very clear. And ſo Leviathans eyes may be ſaid to be like the eye-lids of the morning; Firſt, in their greatneſs; Secondly, in their brightneſs or clearneſs. It is uſual in Scripture to mention the morning light, when it would expreſs the cleareſt light. The Prophet (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.8.) aſſuring the <hi>Jews</hi> of
<pb n="741" facs="tcp:48669:383"/> the greateſt outward proſperity, in caſe they kept a true Faſt, ſaith, <hi>Then ſhall thy light break forth as the morning.</hi> And when the Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> deſcribes God, <hi>making the morning darkneſs</hi> (Chap. 4.13.) As alſo, <hi>turning the ſhadow of death into the morning</hi> (Chap. 5.8.) his meaning is, that the Lord can eaſily, and at pleaſure, change a ſtate of greateſt proſperity, into adverſity; and a ſtate of deepeſt adverſity, into cleareſt or higheſt proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
                  <p>But ſome may ſay, if the Lord intended to ſet forth the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding clearneſs of Leviathans eyes, it might ſeem more proper to have compared them to the light at noon-day, than to the morning light.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, Though the light at noon-day is clearer than that in the morning, conſidered in it ſelf; yet conſidering the morning light, with reſpect to its neerneſs or neighbourhood to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going darkneſs, ſo we are more ſenſible of that than of the light at noon-day. Contraries placed neer together, illuſtrate each other. For, as ſoon as the morning appears, light conveys it ſelf all over the Hemiſphear, and makes a wonderful change in the Air. The morning light coming ſuddenly, and immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diſmal darkneſs, affects us more than the light at noon-day,<note place="margin">Ardentos ocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los ſuffectos ſanguine &amp; igne. <hi>Virg.</hi> l. <hi>2.</hi> Aeniad.

And to what <hi>Bochartus</hi> ſaith of the Whale, that he is ſo dim-ſighted when deep in the Sea, that he cannot find his way without a guide, I
<pb n="742" facs="tcp:48669:384"/> may reply from his own ſhewing out of ſeveral Authors, that the Crocodile is no better at ſeeing when much under water, they teaching, that the Crocodiles eyes are dull while in the water, but out of the water very quick or ſharp-ſighted, as if then at laſt he recovered his eye-ſight; and if ſo, he hath no advantage of the Whale in that particular.</p>

The Hebrew word rendred <hi>Caldron,</hi> properly ſignifies a copper or brazen Kettle, in which dying ſtuff is boyled for the colouring of cloth. It ſignifies alſo a pond, and ſo a great veſſel like a pond; as that in the Temple was called a <hi>Sea,</hi> for its greatneſs.</p>

                     </note> Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viathans heat is ſo vehement, that <hi>his breath kindleth coals.</hi> The Hebrew is, <hi>His ſoul or life kindleth coals.</hi> The ſoul and life of irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional creatures is the ſame, and both are but breath, <hi>His breath kindleth coals;</hi> that is, his breath is ſo hot, that it will even kindle dead or unkindled coals. Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi> renders, <hi>His breath would ſet coals on fire.</hi> The breath of the Whale is not only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a great wind, iſſuing out of a pair of bellows, which ſoon kindleth a ſpark into a great fire, but is it ſelf here compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to a fire by a ſtrong Hyperbole, like that which concludes this matter.</p>
                  <q>And a flame goeth out of his mouth.</q>
                  <p>That is, a heat as from a flame, or ſuch a heat as a flame giveth.</p>
                  <p>Theſe four verſes may be improved for our uſe, in two things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, to inform us how terrible ſome creatures are. There is nothing which is not terrible in this; <hi>His mouth ſends out a burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lamp, and ſparks of fire; ſmoak goeth out of his noſtrils, coals are kindled by his breath, and a flame goeth out of his mouth.</hi> What's the meaning and import of all this? not that Leviathan hath theſe, or doth theſe things indeed; but in his wrath (for this is the deſcription of an enraged Leviathan) he appears as if he were nothing but heat, and would ſet the very element of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter on fire, and turn the very billows of the Sea into burning flames.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>If the Lord hath put ſuch a fierceneſs into this crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture when he is angry, what is there in the Lord himſelf when he is angry!</hi> The Lord in his anger, is deſcribed like this Leviathan (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.7, 8.) <hi>Then the earth ſhook and trembled, the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alſo of the hills moved, and were ſhaken, becauſe he was wroth</hi> (what follows?) <hi>There went up a ſmoak out of his noſtrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured; coals were kindled by it.</hi> The words are almoſt word for word, the ſame with thoſe in the Text. The Lord is ſet forth, as uſhered by fire (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.2, 3.) <hi>Out of</hi>
                     <pb n="744" facs="tcp:48669:385"/> Zion, <hi>the perfection of beauty, God hath ſhined. Our God ſhall come, and ſhall not keep ſilence, a fire ſhall devour before him, and it ſhall be very tempeſtuous round about him.</hi> Again (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 97.2.) <hi>Clouds and darkneſs are round about him</hi> (verſ. 3.) <hi>A fire goeth before him, and burneth up his enemies round about;</hi> that is, he deſtroyeth his enemies in his anger, as if he conſumed them by fire. Once more (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.14.) <hi>The ſinners in</hi> Zion <hi>are afraid, fearfulneſs hath ſurprized the hypocrites; who among us ſhall dwell in the devouring fire? who amongſt us ſhall dwell with everlaſting burnings?</hi> Thus the Scripture ſpeaks of the Lord in his wrath. And doubtleſs the flaming anger of Leviathan, when provoked, is but like a warm Sun-ſhine, compared with the provoked anger, and hot diſpleaſure of God againſt preſumptuous ſinners. Who is able to abide his wrath? who (in ſin) <hi>can dwell with thoſe everlaſting burnings? who</hi> (unpardoned) <hi>can ſtand before the devouring fire, and flames of the Lords diſpleaſure?</hi> Thus we have the diſcovery of Leviathans furious heat; he is all in a flame.</p>
                  <p>Now the Lord having ſhewed what work Leviathan makes with his mouth and noſtrils, which belong to his head, he comes next to his neck.</p>

                     <bibl>
                        <hi>Verſ. 22.</hi>
                     </bibl> In his neck remaineth ſtrength, and ſorrow is turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into joy before him.</q>
                  <p>Leviathans head is ſtrongly joyned to the reſt of his body, by his ſtrong neck; yet ſome queſtion whether the Whale hath any neck or no, becauſe no diſtinction (which in other creatures is viſible) appears between his head and his body. The learned <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chartus</hi> makes this another argument againſt the Whale, and a little reflects upon <hi>Diodate,</hi> who joyning fully with him in opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that Leviathan is the Crocodile, yet lets go this hold, yielding that the Crocodile hath no more neck than the Whale, as the neck is taken ſtrictly for that diſcernable diſtance between head and ſhoulders; and though he himſelf grants that ſeveral other Authors, by him alleadged, ſay the Crocodile hath no neck, yet he anſwers, 'tis ſafer to credit <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> who ſaith the Crocodile hath a neck, and gives this reaſon for it, becauſe thoſe animals which have no neck at all, cannot move their heads, whereas the Crocodile (by the teſtimony of <hi>Pliny</hi> and others) can turn his head upwards, or hold it up backwards to bite his prey.</p>
                  <pb n="745" facs="tcp:48669:385"/>
                  <p>To this ſome anſwer, and I conceive their anſwer may ſatisfie in this Point, That how little, or how undiſcernable ſoever the ſpace is between the head and the body of any animal, the very joyning or coupling of them together, may be called his neck; and in that ſenſe the Whale hath a neck as well as the Crocodile. To this I may add, that the ſhorter the neck of any animal is, the ſtronger it is; and that complies fully with what is here ſaid of the neck of Leviathan,
<q>In his neck remaineth ſtrength.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Hebrew is, <hi>Lodgeth.</hi> And ſo Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi> renders, <hi>In his neck alwayes lodgeth ſtrength;</hi> that is, he is alwayes ſtrong, very ſtrong neckt; his neck is ſo ſtiff and ſtrong, that ſtrength it ſelf may ſeem to have taken up its reſidence there: That's the elegancy of the Hebrew. So then, theſe words ſhew the great ſtrength of Leviathan. A ſtiff or thick neck, ſignifies both ſtrength of body, and ſtoutneſs of ſpirit. Naturaliſts ſay,<note place="margin">Qui collum habent groſſum fortes ſunt, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becilles autem qui illud ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent gracile. <hi>Ariſtot.</hi> in Phyſiognomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis.</note> thoſe creatures are very ſtrong, that are thick neckt, as Bulls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and they are weak that have thin ſlender necks. The Scripture intimates the ſtiffneſs and unyieldingneſs of mans will to the commands of God, by the ſtiffneſs of his neck (<hi>Pſalm.</hi> 75.5.) <hi>Lift not up your horn on high, ſpeak not with a ſtiff neck;</hi> that is, with a neck that will not bow to the Lords yoak, nor obey his commands. Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ones bow their heads to worſhip God, and yield their necks to his will. For though to <hi>bow down the head like a bull ruſh for a day,</hi> be not the Faſt which God hath choſen (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.5.) for that is but an out-ſide repentance, and they who do ſo, may ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſtiff-ſpirited and pertinacious in their ſins; yet the bowing of the head hath in it the appearance of a bowed or humbled heart, and a ſtiff neck is the badge of a proud impenitent one. To ſpeak with a ſtiff neck, is to ſpeak arrogantly. <hi>Hannah</hi> in her Song (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.3.) uſeth this language to the ſtiff ones of the world, <hi>Talk no more ſo exceeding proudly; let not arrogancy come out of your mouth:</hi> we put in the margin, <hi>let not hardneſs come out of your mouth;</hi> that is, let it not appear at your mouths, that your hearts are hard, that your ſpirits are high and ſtiff; ſpeak no more as if you were Leviathans, as if you could not bow your necks. 'Tis good to have a neck ſtrong to bear, but there is nothing worſe than a ſtrong neck that will not bow; yet the ſtrength of Leviathans neck
<pb n="746" facs="tcp:48669:386"/> ſeems rather to imply his courage than his pertinacy, as it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>In his neck remaineth ſtrength,</hi>
                     <q>And ſorrow is turned into joy before him.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are three other readings of theſe words, which I ſhall name, and come to our own,</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Ante cum exilit moeror. <hi>Jun. i. e.</hi> moerore afficit omnes obvios; ac ſi de illis trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans exulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret moeror effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus ab ea hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum. <hi>Jun.</hi>
                     </note>Firſt, Some thus, <hi>In his neck remaineth ſtrength, and before him danceth fear.</hi> Several of the learned inſiſt much upon this tranſlation, and their meaning is this; all that come near Levia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, or within ſight of him, are afraid; all the fiſh in the ſea, and all the mariners upon the ſea that ſee him, dance or haſt away for fear, as if fear cauſed by him, triumphing over them, danced before them. He makes ſuch a combuſtion by ſtirring the waters, and rolling in them, that be frights every living thing he meets with, none dare ſtand him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Maſter <hi>Broughton</hi> renders it thus, <hi>Before him danceth carefulneſs,</hi> that is, (as himſelf gloſſeth) <hi>he takes or hath no care, meeting with any fiſh to feed upon, that his taking thought is a glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> He is ſo ſtrong, that he knows he can maſter all the fiſh that comes near him, and can have prey enough for the taking, to ſatisfie his vaſt ſtomack, and fill his belly; therefore he takes no care for tomorrow, <hi>before him danceth carefulneſs.</hi> Chriſt ſaith to his diſciples, <hi>take no thought for the morrow:</hi> It were well if ſuch carefulneſs danced before us, as Leviathans cares dance before him. We ſay of ſome men, <hi>they ſing care away;</hi> and all carking, heart-cutting, and dividing cares, ſhould even dance away be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all men. The Apoſtles counſel is (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.32.) <hi>I would have you without carefulneſs,</hi> as much as to ſay, let carefulneſs dance before you, or put it from you; uſe the means, and be not ſolicitous about ſucceſſes or iſſues.

                     </gap>e we live by faith, the leſs we live in care, or the more our cares dye; and they whoſe hearts are full of faith, cannot but have their heads emptied of cares. Some ſay, we have a great family, many bellies to fill, and backs to cloth, how can we be without carefulneſs? Conſider one Leviathan needs more food than many families, yet he takes no care; God provides for him though he know it not, and will he not provide for thoſe that know him? therefore let careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs dance before you; That's a good reading for our uſe and comfort.</p>
                  <pb n="747" facs="tcp:48669:386"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, Others tranſlate thus, <hi>before him paſſeth pennury.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Faciem ejus praecedit ege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtas. <hi>Vulg.</hi>
                     </note> The meaning of that reading is; whereſoever Leviathan comes, he leaves nothing but pennury behind him, he devours all before him, and all little enough, ſcarce enough for him; all the fiſh he meets with all in the ſea, he eats them up: the ſea hardly affords enough to fill his huge belly, &amp; ſatisfie his hungry appetite. As 'tis ſaid of Behemoth, he thinks he can draw up <hi>Jordan,</hi> that is, all the waters of <hi>Jordan;</hi> ſo Leviathan thinks he can draw up the ſea, that is, all the fiſh in the ſea; ſo that, how much ſoever he meets with, he looks upon it as pennury, at moſt, as but enough for him. So that this tranſlation, <hi>Before him paſſeth pennury,</hi> may have or bear theſe two interpretations: Either, Firſt, That he makes all pennury where he comes; as its ſaid of the Turkiſh wars, <hi>where the Grand Signiors horſe treads, the graſs will not grow,</hi> he treads down and ſpoils all; Or, as 'tis ſaid in Scripture of thoſe ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, <hi>The land was before them like the garden of</hi> Eden, <hi>and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them as a deſolate wilderneſs.</hi> Or, Secondly, That he thinks all to be but pennury and ſcarcity (how plentiful ſoever it is) that is before him. That which may ſuffice many, is ſcarce a morſel, or a mouthful for him; as if all the fiſh in the ſea could not ſerve him for a break-faſt. As 'tis ſaid of <hi>Alexander the Great,</hi> when he had conquered the known world, he was as hungry and ſharp-ſet as ever, he looked upon all as pennury, and wiſhed there were another world for him to conquer. Thus plenty is pennury to Leviathan, he is an unſatiable gulf: that's a third reading; our own ſaith,</p>

                     <note place="margin">Jam video animo meo par periculum.</note> In ſuch a ſenſe it may be ſaid here of Leviathan, <hi>ſorrow is turned into joy before him.</hi> But whence was this? ſurely from his ſtrength, and the confidence he had in it.</p>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>They who have great ſtrength, think themſelves above ſorrow and danger.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Leviathan is ſo ſtrong that ſorrow is turned into joy before him; how full of joy, or how joyful then is he! as Chriſt ſaith (<hi>Mat.</hi> 6 23.) <hi>If the light that is in thee be darkneſs, how great is that darkneſs?</hi> ſo if our ſorrow be turned into joy to us, how great is our joy?

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ong men hope it ſhall be ſo to them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their pre umption. A ſt ong man rejoyceth to run a race, whereas a weak man is afraid of it; going is grievous to him, much more running. Whatſoever we have ſtrength to do, if we have hearts alſo to do it, we rejoyce to do it; yea, we are ſo apt to rejoyce in our carnal ſtrength of any kind, that the Lord by his Prophet (<hi>Jer.</hi> 9.23.) forbids it in every kind of ſtrength, in ſtrength of underſtanding, <hi>Let not the wiſe man glory in his wiſdom;</hi> he forbids it alſo in ſtrength of eſtate, <hi>Let not the rich man glory in his riches;</hi> and laſtly, he forbids it in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſtrength of body, <hi>Let not the mighty man glory in his might.</hi> And there is great reaſon we ſhould take heed of being found Leviathans in this, ſeing none have been more oppreſſed and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with ſorrow than they, who upon confidence in ſelf-ſtrength have thought themſelves above it, or that it ſhould certainly be turned into joy before them.</p>
                  <p>Further, It will not be unuſeful to conſider, That, as here it is ſaid, <hi>Leviathans ſorrow is turned into joy before him,</hi> ſo it is promiſed to, and the priviledge of, all true believers, to have their ſorrows, or that their ſorrows ſhall be turned into joy before them (<hi>John</hi> 16.20.) <hi>Verily, I ſay unto you</hi> (ſaid Chriſt himſelf) <hi>that ye ſhall weep, and lament, and the world ſhall rejoyce</hi> (here's the caſe of Chriſts Diſciples in this world, <hi>they ſhall weep and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> that is, they ſhall have cauſe to weep, and many times ſhall actually weep and lament) <hi>but your ſorrow ſhall be turned into joy.</hi> As ye ſhall rejoyce in ſpirit under thoſe diſpenſations which

The moſt ſorrowful things ſhall not now be able to ſwallow you up with ſorrow, and at laſt you ſhall not know by any then preſent experience any ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful thing. All your tears ſhall be, not only wiped off from, but out of your eyes; Chriſt will then renew that miracle, in a metaphorical ſenſe, which be once wrought in a natural, of which we read (<hi>John</hi> 2.) <hi>he will turn water into wine;</hi> the waters of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and tribulation, into the wine of joy and conſolation. Which bleſſed priviledge is alſo clearly propheſied (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.13, 14.)</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, If by reaſon of Leviathans ſtrength, his ſorrow is turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into joy, ſurely the faithful, who have the Lord for their ſtrength, may turn their ſorrow into joy, into ſuch joys, as none ſhall take from them, or turn back, or again into ſorrows.</p>

And the Lord would have us know, that the heart of Leviathan is ſo hard, that the heart of any other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in compariſon of his, may be called ſoft and tender. <hi>His heart</hi>
                     <q>Is as firm as a ſtone.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>That is, 'tis extraordinary hard; which is further intended by the laſt words of this verſe,
<q>Yea, as hard as a piece of the nether mill-ſtone.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mills have two ſtones, an upper (which in Hebrew is expreſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a word, which ſignifies <hi>to ride,</hi> becauſe it ſeems to ride (moving or turning round) upon the nether ſtone, which, becauſe it bears the weight of the work in grinding, is the harder of the two, though both are very hard; as if it had been ſaid, if any ſtone be harder than another, that's moſt like the heart of Levia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than.</p>
                  <pb n="751" facs="tcp:48669:388"/>
                  <p>Now though this may have reſpect to the litteral or proper hardneſs of the fleſh of Leviathans heart, yet we are not to ſtay in that ſenſe; for there is a moral or metaphorical hardneſs, as well as a natural or proper hardneſs. The heart of one man is ſaid to be hard, and the heart of another ſoft and tender, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the natural fleſh of one mans heart is hard, and anothers ſoft, but becauſe of a moral hardneſs or tenderneſs in the heart of the one or other. There is no difference between them, in the body of a good and bad man, as to tenderneſs and hardneſs; but the ſoul-heart (if I may ſo ſpeak) of the one, and of the other, differ exceedingly as to hardneſs and tenderneſs. The heart of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very good man (as to the ſpiritual conſtitution of it) is ſoft and tender; but the heart of every evil man is hard and ſtony. Again, a fearful man is ſaid to have a ſoft heart, every little danger pierc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it, or makes an impreſſion upon it; but a man of courage and boldneſs is ſaid to have a hard heart, or a heart of braſs, nothing can daunt him: In this ſenſe Leviathan hath a hard or firm heart, a heart of braſs. The hardneſs of Leviathans heart,<note place="margin">

                     </note> notes his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, boldneſs, and ſtoutneſs; he is not timerous, like many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creatures; his heart is as uncapable of fear as a ſtone, and as impenetrable by any paſſion, as the nether mill-ſtone. So that, to ſay his heart is as hard as a ſtone, is all one as to ſay, <hi>He is fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,</hi> or <hi>he is couragious.</hi> So then,</p>
                  <p>There is a threefold moral hardneſs of heart ſpoken of in Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Impenitency for ſin, is often called hardneſs of heart. They who go on knowingly to ſin againſt God, are bold daring men, they have hard hearts indeed: Such hearts have all men by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and therefore God makes that promiſe to ſinners, <hi>I will take away the heart of ſtone, and give a heart of fleſh (Ezek.</hi> 36.26.)</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Unmercifulneſs or cruelty towards men, is called hardneſs of heart. We commonly ſay of ſuch a man,<note place="margin">Crudeles &amp; inclementes aut è ſaxo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niti, aut cor ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bere ſaxeum dicuntur.</note> he is a hard-hearted man; that is, he is a cruel and unmerciful man.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Couragiouſneſs and ſtoutneſs in appearance of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, may be called hardneſs of heart. A man of great courage, hath a heart hardned againſt all fears and dangers.</p>
                  <p>Leviathan hath a <hi>hard heart,</hi> in theſe two latter ſenſes; he is cruel and unmerciful, he ſpares none, he ſwallows down all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſtinction, a <hi>Jonah</hi> and all, if he meet with him. The Whale
<pb n="752" facs="tcp:48669:389"/> hath no mercy, and therefore may be ſaid to have a hard heart.</p>
                  <p>Again, Leviathan is full of courage, he fears no colours (as we ſay) therefore he may well be ſaid to have a hard heart.<note place="margin">Cor durum ſignum auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciae &amp; fortitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinis. <hi>Plin.</hi> l. <hi>11.</hi> c. <hi>37.</hi>
                     </note> And thoſe creatures which have the hardeſt hearts in a phyſical ſenſe, are obſerved by Naturaliſts to be moſt daring and couragious.</p>
                  <p>Now, as Leviathan is thus fearleſs at the appearance of the greateſt dangers, ſo when he appears, all are filled with fear. As he is altogether dreadleſs, according to the interpretation given of this verſe, ſo he is altogether dreadful, according to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs tenour of the next.</p>

                  <p>We have had in the ſeven verſes laſt opened, the deſcription of Leviathan in many things, which cannot but render him an object of fear and terror; ſurely then, when he ſhews himſelf, all will be in a fright, even <hi>the mighty,</hi> who ſeem beſt fenced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt fear, as the Text ſpeaks, <hi>When he raiſeth up himſelf, the mighty are afraid.</hi>

As Chriſt when he would ſet forth the efficacy of ſeduction, which ſhall be in the latter dayes, ſaith, <hi>Falſe Prophets ſhall come, and deceive, if it were poſſible, the very elect (Mat.</hi> 24.24.)

As Ships in a ſtorm at Sea, are ſaid to <hi>mount up to the Heavens (Pſal.</hi> 107.26.) though they alwayes keep upon the billows of the water; ſo by a like hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbole, we may ſay, when Leviathan raiſeth up himſelf, the Angels of heaven are afraid.

                  </p>
                  <p>Hence Note, Firſt;
<q>Great dangers may put the ſtouteſt into a fear.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Natural fear is a paſſion or perturbation of the mind, raiſed by the appearance, or our apprehenſion of ſome eminent or imminent evil, ready to take hold of us, or fall upon us. And as ſome are of ſo fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a nature, or are made ſo fearful by a ſecret judgement of God upon them, that they are afraid <hi>where no fear is (Pſal.</hi> 53.5.) and
<pb n="754" facs="tcp:48669:390"/> (being purſued with their own guilt) <hi>flee when no man purſueth (Prov.</hi> 28.1.) or (as another Scripture ſpeaks) <hi>At the ſound of a ſhaken leaf;</hi> ſo it is natural to all men to fear, in caſe of real and apparent danger, eſpecially if the danger be like a Leviathan, <hi>very great,</hi> or if a Leviathan raiſe himſelf againſt them: And therefore Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, being in our nature, and cloathed with fleſh, though ſinleſs fleſh, began not only to be afraid, but <hi>amazed (Mark</hi> 14.33.) a little before his paſſion, when he ſaw that greateſt Leviathan, the Devil, together with many great Leviathans, raiſing themſelves to ſwallow him up.</p>
                  <p>And, if when a Leviathan raiſeth up himſelf, the mighty are afraid, how ſhall the mighty be afraid, when God raiſeth up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf! that's the deſign of God in this paſſage. The holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet gave this caution to all men (<hi>Zach.</hi> 2.13.) <hi>Be ſilent, O all fleſh, before the Lord; for he is raiſed up out of his holy habitation.</hi> As if it had been ſaid; the Lord now ſhews himſelf: he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as one aſleep, or laid down upon his bed, but now the Lord is raiſed up. What then? <hi>Be ſilent, O all fleſh.</hi> The mightieſt have reaſon then to be ſilent: How ſilent? There's a twofold ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; Firſt, from ſpeaking; Secondly, from boaſting. That charge in the Prophet is not to be underſtood of a ſilence from ſpeaking, but from boaſting; as if it had been ſaid, Be in fear and reverence, for the Lord is raiſed up out of his holy habitation. Another Prophet tells us, that at the Lords appearances the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhall tremble and be afraid (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.19.) having ſaid a little before, <hi>The loftineſs of man ſhall be bowed down, and the haughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of man ſhall be made low,</hi> He adds, <hi>They ſhall go into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves of the earth, for fear of the Lord, and for the glory of his Majeſty, when he ariſeth to ſhake terribly the earth.</hi> When the Lord ariſeth to ſhake this world by his judgements, he will make the mighty tremble, and run into the holes of the rocks, to hide themſelves from his dreadful preſence. If a creature, a Leviathan, cauſeth the mighty to fear when he ariſeth, how much more may the mightieſt of the world fear, when God ariſeth! and therefore that prayer of <hi>David (Pſal.</hi> 68.1.) <hi>Let God ariſe, let his enemies be ſcattered; let them that hate him, flee before him,</hi> may well be reſolved into this conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal propoſition; <hi>If God ariſeth, his enemies ſhall be ſcattered, and all that hate him ſhall flee before him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="755" facs="tcp:48669:390"/>
                  <p>This may teach the mean and poor of the earth to fear him, who can make the mightieſt afraid. When God is angry, the mighty cannot, then much leſs can mean underlings ſtand before him. When Leviathan <hi>raiſeth himſelf, the mighty are afraid,</hi>

                  <p>Firſt, The word rendred to <hi>purifie,</hi> properly ſignifies to <hi>erre,</hi> or to <hi>wander out of the way;</hi> and it notes, as outward erring or wandring, that of the body, when we know not whither to go, ſo inward wandring, that of the mind, when we know not what to do. The mind or underſtanding wanders often, and roves up and down, we know not whither. In this ſenſe, ſeveral underſtand the words; <hi>By reaſon of breakings they wander,</hi> they are ſtruck with ſuch a fear and amazement, that they run about like men di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted, and out of their wits; or, they (ſuppoſe it of Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners) know not how to guide the Ship, nor how to handle their ſails and tacklings. Some chiefly inſiſt upon this interpretation, <hi>By reaſon of breakings they wander,</hi> or know not what to do next to help or ſave themſelves from periſhing. A man in ſtreights, uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſaith, <hi>I know not what to do.</hi> They who are in much fear of ſuffering in any kind, ſeldom know what to do in any way, for
<pb n="756" facs="tcp:48669:391"/> their own ſafety, and often take the unſafeſt way, running them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves further into danger, while they endeavour to eſcape it. This is a proper and profitable expoſition; and we may note this from it.</p>
                  <q>Great fears cauſeth great diſtractions.</q>
                  <p>Every worldly fear hath ſomewhat of diſtraction in it; and in proportion to the fear, is the diſtraction: therefore great fear muſt needs cauſe great diſtraction. <hi>When men in a ſtorm mount up to heaven, and go down again to the depths,</hi> 'tis ſaid (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 107.26, 27.) <hi>their ſoul is melted becauſe of trouble, they reel to and fro, and ſtagger like a drunken man, and are at their wits end;</hi> their wit cannot go a ſtep further with them, nor their reaſon conduct them any longer. We ſay in the margin, <hi>All their wiſdom is ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up.</hi> He that fears Leviathan will ſwallow him up, may ſoon find his wiſdom ſwallowed up. Wiſe and mighty men may be mightily puzled in great dangers, and utterly diſabled to make uſe, either of their wiſdom or of their might. Good <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.12.) when a great enemy was invading him, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, <hi>O our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no might against them, neither do we know what to do;</hi> we are bereft of counſel. Great dangers even unhinge our reaſon, and put it out of place. The Diſciples of Chriſt in a ſtorm (<hi>Mat.</hi> 8.25.) were not only like men at their wits end, but almoſt at their faiths end too, crying out, <hi>Lord ſave us, we periſh;</hi> if thou help us not, we are all undone: <hi>And he ſaid, why are ye fearful? O ye of little faith.</hi> There is nothing but faith can keep down the prevailings of fear, in great or prevailing dangers &amp; breakings; and when once we are at our faiths end in a time of extremity, we ſhall ſoon be at our wits end alſo, yea, even quite out of our wits. A faithleſs man, is no match for little fears; &amp; he that hath but a little faith, or is a man of little faith, may ſoon be over-matcht with great ones. As perfect love, either the actings of our perfect love to God, or the evidence and apprehenſions of the perfect love of God to us, <hi>caſteth out fear</hi> (1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.18.) that is, all that fear which hath torment in it; ſo alſo doth perfect faith in God, that is, a ſtrong, a well-foundation'd, and a well and high-built faith. 'Tis either for want of faith, or for ſome want in faith, that mighty men by reaſon of breakings, are not only afraid, but <hi>wander,</hi> as uncertain of their way. That's the firſt reading.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, We ſay, <hi>They purifie themſelves:</hi> What's that? there are two interpretations of this tranſlation.</p>

Thus (I ſay) ſome expound this Text, that through ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamity of fear, they are ſurpriſed with a ſuddein looſneſs. The Prophet ſpeaking of a dreadful day, ſaith (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 7.17.) <hi>All knees ſhall be feeble,</hi> we put in the Margin, <hi>All knees ſhall go into the water;</hi> the meaning is (as all interpreters give it) they ſhall not be able to hold there water. And as ſome, upon a ſuddain aſſault of fear, cannot hold their water, ſo, neither can others their ordure. The reaſon of it is plain in nature, fear making a great diſſipation of ſpirits, weakens the retentive faculty. Some look upon this, as a ſenſe too low and mean for the intendment of this place, though in it ſelf a truth. And therefore, 'tis enough to mention it; nor ought it to be left unmentioned, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it may humble us to conſider unto what pitiful exigents mighty ones may be brought, when ſurpriſed with dangers.

                     <hi>They purifie themſelves,</hi> are rather to be taken morally; that is, mighty men, when they ſee themſelves in ſuch danger, mighty Leviathan raiſing himſelf, breaking all before him, what do they? <hi>they purifie themſelves,</hi> that is, they betake themſelves to prayer and repentance; and then they will <hi>purifie themſelves</hi> in all haſt, by confeſſing and vowing to put away their ſins; then they will (in all haſt) make their peace with God, this is a good interpretation. And the word which we tranſlate here to <hi>purifie,</hi> is applied to this ſpiritual purifying, by confeſſing of ſin, and tu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ning to God, and promiſes of amendment (<hi>Pſalm.</hi> 51.7.) <hi>Purge</hi> (or <hi>purifie) me with hyſop, and I ſhall be clean;</hi> only there 'tis Gods act, here mans. But as God doth purge us by pardon, ſo we may be ſaid, to purge our ſelves by repentance, and earneſt ſuing to God for pardon. And how uſual is it, even with bad men, when they are in great danger, when they ſee nothing but death before them, then to fall a praying and repenting, then to confeſs their ſins, and promiſe amendment, or to become new men. Thus <hi>by reaſon of breakings,</hi> when all is ready to be broken, loft, and ſpoiled, <hi>they purifie themſelves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="758" facs="tcp:48669:392"/>
                  <p>Hence, Obſerve;
<q>In great dangers; which threaten preſent death, or undoing at leaſt, even common men will confeſs their ſins, and make great ſhews or ſemblances of repentance.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>When the mighty are afraid, when they are in trouble and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, then they cry to God for mercy, and cry out upon their ſins, as the procuring cauſe of their miſeries and troubles. How good, how godly will they be for a fit (and it may work further) in a day of evil! It is ſaid of the Marriners in a ſtorm (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 107.28.) <hi>Then they cry unto the Lord in their diſtreſſes.</hi> Even ſuch Marriners, as ſeldom think of God, nor pray to him in a calm, being in a ſtorm, fall a praying, <hi>they purifie thomſelves:</hi> Now they are for repentance, now they will caſt their ſins over-board, ſeing themſelves almoſt ſwallowed up by the raging ſea. Thus (<hi>Jon.</hi> 1.4, 5.) <hi>When the Lord ſent out a great wind into the ſea, and there was a mighty tempeſt in the ſea, ſo that the ſhip was like to be broken: Then the Marriners were afraid;</hi> that was the firſt effect which the tempeſt wrought in them: and what was the next? that was a fit of devotion; <hi>They cryed every man to his God:</hi> Now they purified themſelves by repentance and prayer. <hi>Were not theſe Marriners grown very good, when beſet with evil?</hi> Thus many pray, repent, make lamentations over their ſins, take up re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions againſt their ſins in a ſtorm; then, or thus, even carnal, ignorant, common men will purifie themſelves in times of great danger. We ſay well, <hi>true repentances is never too late, but late repentance is ſeldome true.</hi> We may ſay alſo, <hi>Repentance in a ſtorm is good, but repentance in a ſtorm it not always good; real dangers may produce but falſe, feniged, and forced repentance.</hi> And they who repent only when they are in, or becauſe they are in a ſtorm, were never good as yet, nor will they continue in that goodneſs, which then they make ſhew of. As a godly man puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies himſelf when he ſees a ſtorm, ſo he purifies himſelf in a calm too, or when he is in greateſt ſafety. And if we do not purifie our ſelves in a calm, as well as in a ſtorm, our repentance is but the repentance of Heathen Marriners. Be in a calm, what you are in a ſtorm; be when you ſee Lambs, what you were when you ſee or ſaw Leviathans.</p>
                  <pb n="759" facs="tcp:48669:392"/>
                  <p>Secondly, Obſerve;
<q>It is a duty to repent when we ſee great dangers, or <hi>(as the Text ſpeaks)</hi> great breakings.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>To be ſure, we ought to repent in a time of trouble: We are to repent at all times, but then moſt: Be careful you leave not that work undone at any time, but do it very carefully at ſuch a time. It is ſaid of thoſe that <hi>were ſcorched with great heat</hi> (Revel. 16.9.) <hi>they blaſphemod the Name of God, which hath power over thoſe plagues, and they repented not to give him glory.</hi> And of othe s under the fifth vial (ver. 11.) <hi>They blaſphemed the God of heaven, becauſe of their plagues, and of their ſores, and repented not of their deeds.</hi> It was the character of that bad King <hi>Ahaz,</hi> that <hi>in the time of his diſtreſs he ſinned yet more.</hi> What! ſin in a ſtorm! ſin when God is ſcorching, plaguing, and diſtreſſing us! This is not only greateſt impenitency, but higheſt impuden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, or moſt ſenſeleſs ſtupidity. Such are like him, of whom <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> ſpeaks (<hi>Prov.</hi> 23.33, 34.) They are <hi>as he that lieth down in the midst of the ſea, or as he that lieth</hi> (ſleeping 'tis meant) <hi>upon the top of a maſt;</hi> where, by any ſtrong blaſt of wind, or great ſway and yawing of the ſhip, he may be tumbled into the deep.</p>
                  <p>There are two things we ſhould do, when we ſee breakings or great dangers, ready to break us.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, We ſhould hold faſt all the good we have, if we have any. When we are like to loſe all outward good things, and that which is better than any or all of them, our lives, we have reaſon to hold faſt all our ſpiritual and inward good things, the truths of God, our faith in God, our love to God, and all his ways.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If as yet we have not really taken hold of God, and good things, 'tis high time for us do it, when we can no longer hold, but muſt let go all our loved good things of this life, and even our beloved life.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, We ſhould in a day of evil, <hi>Let go all that is evil,</hi> that is, purifie our ſelves, our conſciences, our lives, our hearts, our hands, from all our ſins, from all that is ſinful; then, if ever, let us be found in the practice of that Apoſtical counſel (<hi>Jam.</hi> 4.8.) <hi>Cleanſe your hands ye ſinners, and purifie your hearts ye
<pb n="760" facs="tcp:48669:393"/> double minded.</hi> They ſurely are minded, or reſolved to be filthy ſtill, and never to purifie either heart or hand, who do not ſet their minds to purifie themſelves from evil, in an evil day. When the Lord breaks us by any judgment or viſitation, then 'tis high time for us to <hi>break off our ſins by righteouſneſs,</hi> as <hi>Daniel</hi> adviſed <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> (chap. 4.27.)</p>

                     </bibl> The ſword of him that layeth at him cannot hold.</q>
                  <p>We have in the compaſs of theſe four verſes, as it were a whole magazine of armes, of war-like inſtruments and engines. Armes are of two ſorts.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>Firſt, Offenſive.</item>
                     <item>Secondly, Defenſive.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Offenſive armes are likewiſe of two ſorts.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Such as we ſtrike with, or make uſe of at hand; of which ſort we reckon the ſword and the ſpear.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Such as are uſed at a diſtance; of which ſort are ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, and darts, and ſling-ſtones: All theſe offenſive weapons are here expreſly mentioned. And likewiſe we have here defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive armes, with which we cover and ſhelter the body, in a time of battle or danger, from taking hurt; of which ſort the helmet is a piece of armour for the head, and the habergeon or breaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate, for the fore-part of the body. So that here (I ſay) we have all ſorts of armes. And as we have all ſorts of armes brought together, ſo we have the unprofitableneſs or unſerviceableneſs of them all, or their utter inſufficiency to hurt Leviathan, or to ſave any man harmleſs, or from being hurt by him, as will appear, while I run over and touch upon theſe words.</p>
                  <q>The ſword of him that layeth at him cannot hold.</q>
                  <p>The ſword is an offenſive weapon, with which we aſſault our adverſary at hand. Now though a man doth lay at Leviathan with a ſword, that is, uſeth his utmoſt skill and ſtrength to make the ſword enter, yet it <hi>cannot hold,</hi> or, as the Hebrew is,<note place="margin">Reſilit duritiè tergaris repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus gladius. <hi>Bez.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>will not ſtand or abide;</hi> It will either be broken or dulled, and the edge of it turned and abated, or it will rebound without leaving any impreſſion.

<pb n="762" facs="tcp:48669:394"/> bold as to come near, with a ſword in his hand, to ſtrike Levia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, it is to no purpoſe, for ſuch is the ſtrength of his natural ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, ſuch the hardneſs of his ſcales and skin, he is ſo protected, fenced, and fortified with theſe, that the ſword can do him no more hurt than a thruſt or ſtroke with a bull-ruſh. <hi>The ſword can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>No, nor the ſpear.</q>

                     </note> we are to underſtand not a ſpear and a dart diſtinctly, but <hi>a darting-ſpear,</hi> or <hi>the ſpear that goeth forth:</hi> For there are two ſorts of ſpears. There are ſome ſpears which are held faſt in the hand of him that aſſaults. There are another ſort of ſpears, called Javelins, which are caſt out of the hand. Thus ſome (I ſay) conceive that we are to put theſe two words into one; <hi>Nor can the darting ſpear,</hi> or Javelin (which is caſt out of a mans hand againſt an enemy with greateſt force) enter to wound him.</p>
                  <q>Nor the habergeon.</q>
                  <p>As if he had ſaid; not only cannot theſe offenſive weapons, ſpear, and dart, or the darting-ſpear, hurt Leviathan; but thoſe armes which a man puts on to ſave himſelf from hurt, cannot protect him: Leviathan will be too hard for him; though he weareth a Coat of Male, an habergeon, though he be clothed all over with iron, back and breaſt, <hi>Cap-a-Pe,</hi> yet Leviathan can eaſily cruſh him, he can rend his corſlet, as if it were but a rotten-ragg, and tear it off as eaſily as a wiſp of ſtraw; for, as it followeth,
<q>
                        <bibl>

                  </p>
                  <p>That is, he makes no more of iron and braſs, than we do of a ſtraw, or of a piece of rotten-wood, which crumbles between our fingers, and is broken with the leaſt ſtrain. You may as ſoon wound him with a ſtraw, as with a ſword, and pierce his
<pb n="763" facs="tcp:48669:394"/> Buckler-ſcales, by throwing a rotten ſtick at him, as well as by caſting a dart or javelin at him; he ſlights all your artillery, as if he had reaſon to do it, and fully underſtood that his skin and ſcales were an <hi>armour of proof</hi> againſt all aſſaults.</p>

                     </bibl> The arrow cannot make him flee.</q>
                  <p>Arrows are notable weapons uſed at a diſtance, which being ſhot from a ſtrong bow, and drawn home by a ſtrong arm, wound deeply and deadly; yet Leviathan regards not whole ſhowers of arrows poured upon him. The Hebrew elegancy gives it thus, <hi>The ſons of the bow cannot make him flee.</hi> Maſter! <hi>Broughtons</hi> tranſlation holds the metaphor untranſlated, <hi>The bows child drives him not away.</hi> Arrows are ſometimes called <hi>the ſons of the bow,</hi> and ſometimes they are called the <hi>ſons of the quiver</hi> (Lament. 3.13.) becauſe arrows are firſt taken out of a quiver, where they are kept, and ſo are, as it were, <hi>children of the quiver;</hi> and then arrows are put upon the ſtring of the bow, and being ſhot out of it, may be called alſo <hi>ſons of the bow.</hi> Arrows come out of the quiver and the bow, as children from parents. And as in this Scripture, arrows are called children, ſo in another, children are compared to arrows (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 127.4.) <hi>As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man, ſo are children of the youth; happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them,</hi> that is, who hath many children. Here (by the way) give me leave to mind the Reader, that 'tis uſual in Scripture to call any thing that comes out of, or proceeds from another, its ſon or child. Thus corn is called <hi>the ſon of the floore</hi> (Iſa. 21.10.) <hi>O my threſhing, and the corn of my floor;</hi> the Hebrew is, <hi>O my threſhing, and the ſon of my floor.</hi> Corn is called the ſon of the floor, becauſe it comes from the floor, where it is threſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and delivered by the force of the flail, out of the husk or chaff in which it was bred, and lay as a child in his mothers womb. Thus alſo ſparks which come from the coal, are called <hi>ſons of the coal</hi> (Job 5.7.) According to this frequent Hebraiſme, arrows are here called the <hi>ſons of the bow. The arrow cannot make him flee.</hi> Though arrows fly at Leviathan, he ſcorns to flee from ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, he will ſtir no more when you ſhoot a feathered arrow at him, than if you ſhot only a feather at him. And as he contemns arrows, ſo
<q>
                        <pb n="764" facs="tcp:48669:395"/>Sling-ſtones are turned with him into ſtubble.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Bows and ſlings were of great uſe in war, before the invention of guns. Thoſe <hi>Benjamites</hi> were famous, who, as the holy Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reports them, could <hi>ſling ſtones at a hairs breadth, and not miſs</hi> (Judg. 20.16.) <hi>David</hi> went out againſt <hi>Goliah</hi> the Giant, weaponed only with a ſling, and five ſtones. Slings are no contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible weapons, ſeing with a ſling-ſtone <hi>David</hi> overthrew <hi>Goliah</hi> the <hi>Philiſtine,</hi> who made the whole hoſt of <hi>Iſrael</hi> tremble. Yet ſling-ſtones, with this <hi>Sea-goliah,</hi> Leviathan, are turned into <hi>ſtubble,</hi> that is, he even blows them away like ſtubble, nor cares he at all for their blows. When the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> would ſhew how eaſily the Lord could ſubdue the enemies of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he prayeth againſt them in this manner (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 83.13.) <hi>Make them, O my God, as a wheel, and as the ſtubble before the wind,</hi> that is, render them weak, and altogether unable to do miſchief. The Prophet deſcribes the eaſie overthrow of the wicked enemy, by this metaphor (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.24.) <hi>The whirl-wind ſhall take them away as ſtubble.</hi> And when the Prophet would ſhew how mighty the Lord aſſiſted <hi>Abraham</hi> againſt his enemies, he ſaith (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.2.) <hi>He gave them as the duſt to his ſword, and as driven ſtubble to his bow.</hi> Now as in all theſe Scriptures it appears from this ſimilitude, how unable the ſtrongeſt are to ſtand before the Lord, ſo, when the Lord would ſhew how impregnable this Leviathan is, he ſaith, <hi>Sling-ſtones are no more to him than ſtubble;</hi> yea, and he doubles it,

                  <p>We had darts in the 26th verſe, yet the original words differ; and 'tis very probable, that as the words differ, ſo the weapons, intended by them, differed alſo, though now unknown to us, and ſo we want names for them, or know not how to name them with a difference.<note place="margin">Tanquam ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pula habentur ab ipſo machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae bellieae. <hi>Bez.</hi>

                  <p>To ſhake a ſpear, is as it were, to threaten one with a ſpear; and ſo to brandiſh a ſword againſt an enemy, is to defie him, or to bid him do his worſt, or it tells him that you will do your beſt to overcome and conquer him. Leviathan ſcorns when any threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten him with their weapons in hand. If you ſhake your ſpear at him, he <hi>laughs at it;</hi> that is, he ſlights it, he regards it not. 'Tis the ſame word which is uſed (<hi>Job</hi> 39.22.) concerning the horſe, <hi>at fear he mock<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Eliphaz</hi> ſaith of a godly man (<hi>Job</hi> 5.22.) <hi>at de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and famine he ſhall laugh.</hi> The godly man is ſo fortified with a promiſe and aſſurance of protection and proviſion by God, that neither ſword nor famine can daunt his ſpirit, yea, he, as it were, laughs at them, as Leviathan at the ſhaking of a ſpear.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have paſſed, or poſted rather, through theſe four verſes, the general ſenſe of them all being the ſame, and that to ſhew that Leviathan is ſo armed by nature, that no artificial arms can hurt him.</p>
                  <p>This part alſo of Leviathans deſcription, is taken by <hi>Bochartus</hi> as a further proof, that the Leviathan here ſpoken of, is the Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codile, whoſe ſcales are not penetrable by the force of any wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon; whereas (ſaith he) the skin of the Whale gives paſſage to the forcible ſtroke or thruſt of any ſharp-edged, or ſharp-point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed inſtrument.</p>
                  <p>For anſwer to this, I have no more to ſay than what hath been ſaid, at the 15th, 16th and 17th verſes of this Chapter, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſcales of Leviathan, to which I refer the Reader; and ſhall paſs on, when I have given three or four hints, by way of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement from the whole.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>If the Lord hath made a creature that no weapon can hurt, then ſurely the Lord himſelf is exalted above all hurt from the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> as it is ſaid in another place of this Book (<hi>Chap.</hi> 35.6.) <hi>If thou ſinneſt, what doſt thou againſt him? or if thy tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be multiplyed, what doſt thou unto him?</hi> that is, thou canſt not hurt God with thy ſin. Though men by ſin lay at him, as with ſword and ſpear, though they throw their ſling-ſtones of blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
<pb n="766" facs="tcp:48669:396"/> at him, they cannot hurt him. <hi>Gamaliel (Acts</hi> 5.39.) gives warning againſt this; take heed what ye do, <hi>refrain from theſe men, leſt haply ye be found, even to fight againſt God.</hi> They fight againſt God, who ſet themſelves to do miſchief; but what miſchief ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they do to men, or among men, they can do none to God, their weapons reach him not. As <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us (<hi>Prov.</hi> 21.30.) <hi>There is no wiſdom nor counſel againſt the Lord;</hi> ſo there is no wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon againſt the Lord: <hi>Sword, and ſpear, and dart,</hi> whether materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al or metaphorical, <hi>are but ſtubble before him.</hi> And as the Lord himſelf is beyond the reach of weapons, and the rage of man, ſo are they who are under the Lords protection; therefore it is ſaid of the Church (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.17.) <hi>No weapon formed againſt thee ſhall proſper;</hi> that is, it ſhall not have the intended effect of the Smith that made it (as that Scripture ſpeaks) nor of the hand that weilds it. <hi>The ſword of him that layeth at the Church of God, ſhall not hold; the ſpear, the dart, nor the habergeon.</hi> As none are ſo much aſſaulted as the Church, ſo none are ſo well armed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As no offenſive weapon can hurt the Lord, ſo no defenſive weapon can ſhelter us from hurt, if under the wrath of the Lord. Though we have got an <hi>Habergeon,</hi> though we have ſcales or bucklers like Leviathan, yet the Lord hath a ſword, a ſpear, a dart, that can ſtrike through them, that is, through all the defences of the moſt hardned ſinners in the world. There is no ſhelter to be found, nor defence to be made againſt the weapons of divine wrath, but only in and by Jeſus Chriſt. God is a ſhield and Buckler, a Helmet and an Habergeon for belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, againſt all offenſive weapons of men or devils; but where ſhall unbelievers find a ſhield or a buckler to ſecure themſelves againſt the offenſive weapons of God!</p>
                  <p>Again, ſome in allegorizing this Scripture, ſay, that Leviathan is an emblem of the Devil. Now, though it be a truth, that no outward weapon, no ſword nor dart can terrifie or hurt the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, yet the Lord hath furniſhed us with weapons that can pierce the Devil, that Leviathan, and defend us from his power (<hi>Eph.</hi> 6.14, 15, 16.) The ſword of the Spirit, the Word of God, will wound that old Leviathan; the Breaſt-plate of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the Helmet of Salvation, the Shield of Faith, will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve us from woundings, in the midſt of all his fiery darts. How
<pb n="767" facs="tcp:48669:396"/> ſoon would the Devil, that cunning, and curſed, and cruel Dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Archer, wound our ſouls to death, with his fiery darts and poyſonous arrows, if the Lord had not given us a ſhield, a breaſt-plate, and an helmet, more impenetrable than the ſcales of Leviathan!</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, This deſcription of Leviathan, carrieth in it a fit reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of a hardned ſinner, of a ſinner reſolved upon his evil wayes. Some ſinners come at laſt to ſuch a hardneſs, that they are like Leviathan, nothing will pierce them; the ſword of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit doth not enter them. Though you lay at them with all your might in the Miniſtry of the Word, though you caſt darts, and ſhoot arrows of terrible threatnings againſt them, they eſteem them but ſtraw and ſtubble; ſin hath ſo hardned them, that they (as we may expreſs it) are <hi>Sermon-proof, threatning-proof,</hi> yea, <hi>judgement-proof too,</hi> as to amendment by them, though they are broken and periſh under them. Let God ſay what he will in his Word, or do what he will in his works, they regard it not; they laugh at the ſhaking of theſe ſpears. As a man that hath ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of proof, cares not for ſword or ſpears, fears not an arrow nor a bullet; ſo 'tis in a ſpiritual ſenſe with reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſinners: God having as a juſt judgement for former ſins, given them a ſhield upon their hearts (as the word ſignifieth, <hi>Lam</hi> 3.65.) which we render <hi>ſorrow of heart,</hi> and put in the margin <hi>obſtinacy,</hi> that is, hardneſs of heart, they then account reproofs, threats, admonitions, the moſt terrible words in all the armoury of God, no more than a ſtraw or rotten wood. Woe to theſe Leviathans, to thoſe who harden their hearts againſt the Word of God. <hi>Who hath hardned himſelf againſt the Word of the Lord, and proſpered?</hi> And let all ſuch know, that (as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4.) <hi>The weapons of our warfare are not carnal</hi> (that is, weak, dull, edgeleſs, pointleſs tools) <hi>but mighty through God,</hi> &amp;c. And that, though now they prevail not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, yet they will prevail to condemnation; and that while they go on to ſin, they are but going (as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks of the young wanton, <hi>Prov.</hi> 7.22.) <hi>As an Ox goeth to the ſlaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the ſtocks, till a dart ſtrike through his liver.</hi> God will have a dart at laſt, which ſhall enter, a dart which thoſe Leviathans ſhall not count ſtubble, nor find to be ſo.</p>
                  <p>The Lord proceeds to deſcribe Leviathan, and, as we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
<pb n="768" facs="tcp:48669:397"/> to give a further demonſtration of the hardneſs of his ſcales and skin.</p>

                  <p>Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi> reads it, <hi>His underneath-places be as ſharp-ſheards.</hi> The word rendred <hi>Sharp ſtones,</hi> properly ſignifies the ſharp pieces of a pot-ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>rd; that is, ſtones or other hard things, as ſharp and pricking as the pieces of a broken pot-ſheard. We may expound this verſe two wayes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, As being a proof of the hardneſs and firmneſs of Levia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans skin and fleſh; ſo hard they are, that he can lye down and reſt himſelf upon hard and ſharp ſtones, even upon the ſharp tops of rocks in the Sea, as we lye down upon our beds. <hi>Sharp ſtones are under him,</hi> but he feels them not; which may be the meaning alſo of the next words.</p>
                  <q>He ſpreadeth ſharp pointed things upon the mire.</q>
                  <p>That is, Leviathan like ſome hardy man, or <hi>iron-ſides,</hi> ſcorns to lye ſoft on the ouze or mire, but laying, as it were, ſharp ſtones upon it, ſhews what he can endure without hurt. And ſo I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive theſe words, <hi>He ſpreadeth ſharp-pointed things upon the mire,</hi> may be thus underſtood and read, <hi>He ſpreadeth himſelf upon ſharp-pointed things, as if it were upon the mire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, We may expound this verſe as to the falling off of darts caſt, and ſtones ſlung at him, or as to the breaking of ſwords and ſpears upon his ſcales, when aſſaulted with them. As if it had been ſaid, If you caſt darts, or ſling ſtones at him, they do not enter, but drop down under him; or, if you aſſail him with ſword and ſpear, the ſword breaks, the ſpears point is ſnapt off, and falls under his body. Thus he ſpreadeth ſharp pointed things upon the mire, or ſpreadeth the mire all over with ſharp pointed things. As after a well-fought battel at Land, we may ſee the field ſpread over with pieces of ſwords and ſpears, and other broken weapons; ſo is the bottom of the Sea (could you ſee to the bottom of it) after a skirmiſh, or day of battel with Leviathan. This is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable ſenſe, but I rather take the former, as ſhewing the hardneſs of his skin and ſcales, by his inſenſibleneſs of any ſharp or hard thing that he reſts himſelf upon.</p>
                  <pb n="769" facs="tcp:48669:397"/>
                  <p>All that I ſhall add is this: It were well for us, if in this caſe we could be like Leviathan, if we could harden our ſelves, or inure our ſelves to hardſhips, to lye with ſharp ſtones under us. Surely our fleſh is much too tender and ſoft, and our skin too de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate for the endurance of a lodging upon hard ſtones, and ſharp pointed things. The Apoſtle gives a ſutable word of advice to <hi>Timothy</hi> (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6.) <hi>Do thou endure hardſhip, as a good ſouldier of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> We ſhould labour to endure hardſhip, and to fare hard, and to lye hard. <hi>Edmond,</hi> a <hi>Saxon</hi> King in this Land, was called <hi>Iron-ſides.</hi> I fear there are few <hi>Iron-ſides</hi> among us, ſuch I mean, as are fit and ready to endure hardſhip, to ſuffer hard things at Chriſts call, and for his Name ſake: We ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, as the Church once was (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.30.) to <hi>lye among the pots,</hi> yea, as Leviathan, <hi>upon the pot-ſheards,</hi> in that behalf. The old Martyrs were patient, while they lodged in a coal-houſe, and ruſſeled among the ſtraw. Though the Lord doth not exerciſe with ſuch hardſhips, yet 'tis the duty of every Chriſtian to get his heart into readineſs and willingneſs to endure them. Though all the followers of Chriſt are not honoured with ſufferings for him; yet they who have nor, at leaſt who pray not that they may have, a ſpirit of ſuffering, are not worthy to follow him, nor to be called his Diſciples, (<hi>Mat.</hi> 10.38. <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.24. <hi>Luke</hi> 14.26.)
<q>
                        <bibl>

                  </p>
                  <p>As Leviathan troubles Sea-men, ſo he troubles the Sea;<note place="margin">Totum oceanum turbat. <hi>Jun.</hi>
                     </note> he macerates and vexeth the waters, he diſturbs <hi>the whole Ocean where he is, or whereſoever he comes.</hi> This is illuſtrated by a double ſimilitude; Firſt, of a boyling pot, <hi>He maketh the deep like a boyling pot.</hi> Secondly, <hi>He maketh the Sea like a pot of oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> Or, as Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi> renders it, <hi>He ſets the Sea as a ſpicers Kettle;</hi> that is, all in a ſume and foam. Spices mingled in a ket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to make ointment, boyl vehemently upon the fire; any li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor boyling is moved, and the more it boyles, the more it moves. Thus Leviathan bluſtring in the deep, cauſeth it to look like a boyling pot, or like a pot of ointment. This ſhews the force of Leviathan; he makes ſuch a buſſel, that he, as it were, raiſeth a
<pb n="770" facs="tcp:48669:398"/> ſtorm in the Sea: a fiercely boyling pot over the fire, much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles the Sea when the waves foam, and the waters are enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the winds. The mighty power of God is ſet forth in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, calming the Sea when 'tis ſtormy, and raiſing ſtorms when it is calm, as might be ſhewed in many Scriptures. Leviathan can trouble the Sea, when God hath made it quiet; but he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not quiet nor calm it, when God hath made it ſtormy. Leviathan is of a turbulent nature, and he deals only in ſtorms; his reſtleſs ſpirit will not let the Sea reſt, he makes <hi>it boyl like a pot,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>That which is ſaid of Leviathan in his turmoiling the Sea, may well repreſent the ſpirit of wicked men, who in this are like Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viathan; they (as the Prophet ſpeaks (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.20.) <hi>are like the troubled Sea, when it cannot reſt;</hi> and as themſelves are like the troubled Sea, having continual tumultuations in their own breaſts, ſo they often make others like a troubled Sea.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall not here omit what the learned <hi>Bochartus</hi> takes notice of in this verſe, both for and againſt his Aſſertion, That Levia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than is the Crocodile.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Though it cannot be denied, that the Whale makes a greater ſtir in the Sea, and troubles the waters more than the Crocodile (the Whale being much the greater of the two) yet he conceives the latter part of the verſe (where 'tis ſaid, <hi>He makes the Sea like a pot of ointment</hi>) very peculiar to the Crocodile. For (ſaith he) many Writers commend the fragrancy or ſweet ſmell which the Crocodile ſends forth, much like that of musk, or the <hi>Arabian</hi> ſpices, inſomuch that ſome think <hi>Amber-greeſe</hi> is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from that Animal. And hence he concludes, it may well be ſaid, that he (where he comes) makes the Sea like a pot of oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which gives a fragrant ſmell, then eſpecially when ſtirred, as Leviathan is here ſaid to ſtir. This is indeed a rare ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, and ſuch as <hi>Bochartus</hi> might well ſay, he could not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough admire, that the Ancients ſhould give no hint at all of; his teſtimonies for it, being from Authors of ſomewhat a late date, which the Reader may peruſe for his fuller obſervation, if he pleaſe. I would not raiſe any ſuſpition about the truth of the thing, which <hi>Bochartus</hi> ſaith cannot but be true, it being aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the unanimous vote of people of all Nations, <hi>Indians, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabians, Egyptians, Aſſyrians and Americans.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All that I ſhall ſay to it, is only this, That the Text in <hi>Job</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="771" facs="tcp:48669:398"/> this ſcope to deſcribe the turbulency of Leviathan in the Sea, ſeems not to reſpect the ſavour or ſmell of the pot of ointment, but only the troubled motion or ebullition of it, when 'tis boyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over the fire: And in that reſpect, the Whale maketh the Sea like a pot of boyling ointment, as much as, yea, more than the Crocodile.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing which <hi>Bochartus</hi> takes notice of in this verſe, is an objection which may be raiſed from it, againſt his opinion. The Lord ſpeaks of Leviathan, as being in the Sea, and (which is a word of the ſame ſignificancy) in the deep. Now, the Croco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dile is not a Sea-animal, but a River-animal, therefore Levia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than is not a Crocodile. To this he anſwers,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That the River <hi>Nilus</hi> is called the <hi>Egyptian Sea (Iſa.</hi> 11.15.) and quotes a <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Doctor, who expounds it ſo. To this I may reply, That other learned men (and among them the late Annotators upon our <hi>Engliſh Bible</hi>) deny that expoſition, and are very confident, that by the <hi>Egyptian Sea,</hi> is meant (not <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> but) the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> which out of the main Ocean ſhoots into the Land, in form and faſhion of a tongue.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, He anſwers, that not only the River <hi>Nilus,</hi> and the Lakes adjoyning to it, which abound with Crocodiles, but ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other great Lakes, both in holy Writ, and by many Writers, are called Seas; and therefore he concludes, the argument will not hold, that by the name <hi>Leviathan</hi> the Crocodile cannot be ſignified, becauſe the Sea is here aſſigned as the ſeat or habitation of Leviathan.</p>
                  <p>I grant this is is not a concluding argument againſt the Croco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dile, yet from theſe words we may gather a probable argument for the Whale; for as the word <hi>Sea</hi> is taken ſometimes in a large ſenſe, for great Rivers and Lakes where Crocodiles are, ſo in ſtrict and proper ſenſe, it alwayes ſignifies the Ocean, where Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codiles are not. And the Scripture tells us, that the proper place appointed by God for the moſt proper Leviathans ſeat, is not the Sea, in a large and improper ſenſe, but in that which is moſt ſtrict and proper, even that which is called <hi>the great and wide Sea (Pſal.</hi> 104.24, 25.) as was ſhewed before. And that we have reaſon to believe, that God ſpake to <hi>Job</hi> of and about the moſt proper and eminent of all thoſe animals, which by Scripture allowance may be called Leviathan, was there alſo ſhewed. And if ſo, then we
<pb n="772" facs="tcp:48669:399"/> muſt neceſſarily underſtand the great and wide Sea, by that <hi>Deep</hi> in the Text, which Leviathan <hi>maketh to boyl like a pot,</hi> and by that <hi>Sea</hi> alſo, which <hi>he</hi> (by his boyſterous motion) <hi>makes like a pot of ointment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus the Lord in this verſe, hath told us what work Leviathan makes when he is below in the deep, and raiſing himſelf towards the ſurface of the Sea; in the next he tells us, what he doth when he ſwims aloft.</p>

                  <p>'Tis good in one ſenſe, to make a path ſhine after us; that is, by the holineſs and righteouſneſs of our lives.

                  <q>One would think the deep to be hoary.</q>
                  <p>The word ſignifies the <hi>hoarineſs</hi> of the head of an old man. When we grow old, our hair changeth colour, and the head is hoary. Leviathan makes ſuch a foamy path, that one would think the Sea gray-headed, or that a hoary froſt covered the Sea. That metaphor was often uſed by the old Poets.</p>
                  <p>All I ſhall ſay from this verſe, is, to take notice of the good providence of God, that this hurtful and dangerous creature <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viathan</hi> gives ſuch warning where he is. While he lies below in the Sea he can do no hurt; and as often as he raiſeth himſelf up, he makes a path to ſhine, he makes the Sea hoary, by which we may the more eaſily diſcover and avoid him; whereas otherwiſe, he might do miſchief unawares, or eaſily ſurprize the unwary paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger. 'Tis mercy, when they who, like Leviathan, are able to
<pb n="773" facs="tcp:48669:399"/> do much hurt, make ſuch a path ſhine after them, as gives any an opportunity to eſcape them, and keep out of danger. Thus we have as it were, the picture of Leviathan, drawn by the hand of God himſelf: And from all, it appears that he is a very <hi>None-ſuch,</hi> or that his fellow is not to be found, he hath no equal in the viſible world, ſuch another is no where to be had.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Lord concludes.</p>

(As if he had ſaid, <hi>Why ſhould I wade further in a deſcription of him by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars? I will ſay all, I will wind up all in a word; he is ſuch a one, as in the earth there is not his like.</hi> Or, as if the Lord had ſaid to <hi>Job, I told thee before of Behemoth, that he is the chief of my ways; yet he comes far ſhort of Leviathan, for upon earth there is not his like.</hi> Leviathan is not only the chief in his own domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, among the fiſhes of the ſea, but alſo among the beaſts of the earth, the ſtrongeſt and ſtouteſt of which are not to be compared with him.</p>
                  <p>Before I proceed with the opening of theſe two verſes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our tranſlation, which generally holds out Leviathan to be the Whale; and before I touch ſome other tranſlations, which bear the ſame interpretation, I ſhall propoſe the tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and interpretation given by the learned <hi>Bochartus,</hi> which accommodates theſe two concluding verſes fully to the Croco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dile.

Now though the Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codile

Thus far the learned <hi>Bochartus</hi> gives us his tranſlation and underſtanding of theſe two verſes, compleating the deſcription of Leviathan.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall now conſider our own tranſlation.</p>
                  <q>
                     <pb n="775" facs="tcp:48669:400"/>

                  <p>But in what is it, that Leviathan exceeds all creatures on earth? ſo that <hi>he hath not his like,</hi> or <hi>there is no compariſon to him,</hi> as ſome render the words.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, In theſe two things, both which appear by what hath been ſaid before, and one of them is expreſt in that which follows.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, There is none like him for greatneſs.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There is none like him for his fearleſneſs or ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and therefore it is ſaid, <hi>he is made without fear:</hi>

                     </note> As if the Lord had ſaid, <hi>There is no creature upon earth ſo ſtout, but may be made afraid, the very Lion may be skared.</hi> Naturaliſts ſpeak of ſome ways, whereby the Lion is made afraid, but nothing can make Leviathan afraid, he is made (as one tranſlation hath it) <hi>That he ſhould fear nothing,</hi> or no man, neither one nor other. And as he feareth none, ſo all are or have reaſon to fear him; but when the moſt dreadful things appear, there is not the leaſt appearance of dread in him. Is not Leviathan full of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, ſeing he is altogether fearleſs? Where there is no fear there is nothing but courage, or courage at the height. It hath been noted in hiſtory, concerning ſeveral great men of the world, that notwithſtanding all their greatneſs, they have been very full of fear, they eſpecially, who have been either unrighteous or cruel in the exerciſe of their power: But Leviathan, though he be great, and cruel too, yet he hath no fear. Fear (as was ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) is that trouble of mind, which ſeizeth upon us at the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of ſome impending, or near-hand danger. Leviathan is, not ſaid to be without fear, as they who are not apprehenſive of danger, but as they, who though they ſee and apprehend great danger near them, yet fear it not. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the earth is not his like, who is made without fear.</hi> From the former part the verſe,</p>
                  <p>Obſerve, Firſt;
<q>It is of God that the creatures are diſpoſed into ſeveral ranks and degrees, that one exceeds and excells another.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>In ſome things there is a likeneſs among all creatures, and there may be ſomething wherein one exceeds them all, and hath none like him; that it is ſo, is of God. Some men are ſo bad, that
<pb n="776" facs="tcp:48669:401"/> they have not their like; it was ſaid of <hi>Ahab, there was none like him.</hi> There are alſo men ſo good, that there are none like them, as the Lord ſaid to Satan of <hi>Job</hi> (Chap. 1.8.) <hi>Haſt thou not conſidered my ſervant</hi> Job, <hi>that there is none like him in the earth.</hi> There God ſpake of <hi>Job</hi> with reſpect to his holineſs and righteouſneſs, as here of Leviathan, with reſpect to his greatneſs and fearleſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the earth there is not his like.</hi> Now as it is of the Devil, that any are beyond all others in wickedneſs; ſo it is of the Lord, that any exceed others in goodneſs, in holineſs, in patience, in righteouſneſs, in faith, in faithfulneſs, in fruitfulneſs; this is by ſpecial diſpenſation from the Lord. It is alſo of the Lord, that any among the irrational creatures exceed their fellows, as was further ſhewed concerning Behemoth, from thoſe words in the fortieth Chapter, <hi>He is the chief of the ways of God;</hi> and as here it is ſaid of Leviathan, <hi>There is none like him, who is made without fear.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note, Secondly;
<q>It is of God that one creature is leſs fearful than another.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>As the outward compoſure of the creature is of God, ſo alſo is the inward diſpoſition. Some creatures are (as I may ſay) no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but fear; ſuch is the Hare; whence we ſpeak proverbially, <hi>as fearful as a Hare.</hi> The Hart is a goodly creature, yet a little dog will make a hundred of them run. But there are other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that may be ſaid to have no fear at all; <hi>Solomon</hi> gives that character of a Lion (<hi>Prov.</hi> 30.30.) <hi>There are three things which go well, yea four, that are comely in going, a Lion which is ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt among beaſts, and turneth not away from any,</hi> that is, fears not any. And as among irrational creatures, one is more fearleſs than another, ſo it is among men; one is of a fearful ſpirit, and another of a couragious ſpirit. This alſo is of God, yet there are ſpecial and particular reaſons, why ſome men are fuller of fear than others.</p>
                  <p>Again, when the Lord would expreſs the perfection of this creature, he ſaith, <hi>He is made without fear.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="777" facs="tcp:48669:401"/>
                  <p>Hence note, Thirdly;
<q>The leſs fear, the more perfection, unleſs it be of that fear which is our perfection, the fear of God: then indeed the more fear the more perfection.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>We may diſtinguiſh of fear: There is godly fear, and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral fear. The leſs natural fear, the more perfection; but the more godly fear: The more perfection; the more we fear God, the more perfect we are; but the leſs of natural fear, or fear of the creature we have, the more perfect we are. The perfection of the godly is often expreſt by being above, or by being delivered from fear (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.5.) <hi>Thou ſhalt not be afraid for the terrour by night, nor for the arrow that flyeth by day.</hi> The Lord ſaith to many, fear; but there are but few of whom he ſaith, and for whom he undertakes, that they ſhall not fear; eſpecially, in a time of ſuch great fear, as is ſpoken of in that 91ſt <hi>Pſalm,</hi> a time of Plague, and that in the heat, when the ſlain of the Lord are many, and men fall by thouſands on the one hand, and on the other. Truſt in God is the ſpecial qualification of the perſon, who ſtands under the protection of that promiſe in the <hi>Pſalm</hi> laſt mentioned. And the ſame promiſe is made to a man fearing God (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 112.7.) <hi>No evil tidings ſhall make him afraid. David</hi> profeſſed this gracious fearleſsneſs (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 46.2.) <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the earth be removed, and the hills be carried into the midſt of the ſea, yet will not I fear.</hi> And again (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 23.4.) <hi>Though I walk through the valley of the ſhadow of death, I will fear no evil.</hi> 'Tis the perfection of a man not to fear outward dangers; therefore Chriſt rebuked his Diſciples (<hi>Mat.</hi> 8.28.) <hi>Wherefore did ye fear, O ye, of little faith?</hi> Their faith was very little, elſe their fear would not have been ſo great. Now as it is thus in man; the leſs of natural fear, the greater is his perfection: ſo alſo among other creatures, it is a note of their perfection, to be made without fear; for it ſhews the greatneſs of their courage, as alſo of their ſtrength. And, this is abſolutely the perfection of God, whoſe infinite inſuperable power and ſtrength, is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered with a moſt conſtant ſerenity and immutability of mind, who as he wants nothing, ſo he fears nothing. Thus our tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion carrieth the verſe: I ſhall touch upon a ſecond, before I part with it.</p>

                     <hi>His dominion is not over the duſt: he is made without fear.</hi> The reaſon of this variety of tranſlation is, becauſe the word which we render <hi>[like]</hi> ſignifies <hi>power</hi> or <hi>dominion;</hi> and the reaſon why the ſame word ſignifies to have power, as alſo <hi>to compare</hi> or <hi>be like,</hi> is, becauſe thoſe things which are great above others, uſe to be the matter of compariſon: And hence it is, that as we, and others, render, <hi>upon earth none is like him, or to be compared to him;</hi> ſo others, taking the word ſtrictly and properly, ſay, <hi>his dominion or magiſtracy is not upon the earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The text thus read, ſhews the Lords great goodneſs to men upon the earth; that having made ſuch a huge, vaſt, dreadful creature, he hath not given him any power or dominion upon the land, but by his providence hath ſhut him up in the ſea, where he can do leſs hurt: for if Leviathan, or a creature of his bigneſs and power, ſhould live upon the land, there were no living by him, either for man or beaſt. As it is an argument of Gods care of, and benignity to mankind, that thoſe land creatures, Lions, Tygers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which deſtroy and prey upon others, are ſo ordered, that in the day time, they retire to their dens (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.22.) and when night comes, then they go abroad: God ſhuts them up in the day time, when they might do moſt hurt, or hinder man from doing good, that is, the duties of his calling abroad in the open fields. (<hi>ver.</hi> 23.) 'Tis alſo a great part of the wiſdom and good provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, to ſhut up the Leviathan within the bounds of the ſea; his power, his dominion <hi>is not over the duſt, or upon the land.</hi> The Author of this tranſlation gloſſeth it thus: <hi>How ſmall a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter were it,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to ſay, that Leviathan hath not his like upon earth;</hi> far another thing is here intended or handled. Here Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine providence is hinted to us, which gives laws and limits to earth and ſea, and to all things contained in them: He hath not formed, nor fitted the body of Leviathan with members of uſe upon the earth; therefore the ſea is his dominion, not the land. This is a truth, and a uſeful conſideration.</p>
                  <p>Yet, I conceive, the Lord doth here rather highten the power of Leviathan, by ſaying, He hath not his like on earth. For it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken for granted that he hath not his like in the ſea, nothing could be ſaid more to ſet forth his greatneſs than this, that he hath not his like at land. And ſome of the Hebrew Doctors ſay,
<pb n="779" facs="tcp:48669:402"/> the Lord ſpake thus, becauſe beaſts on the land are ſtronger than fiſh in the ſea; and they give a reaſon for it, upon a Philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ground, becauſe much moiſture weakens. Therefore the wonderful, even, preternatural ſtrength of Leviathan appears in this; that he being a water animal, ſhould yet be both bigger and ſtronger than any beſt of the earth. <hi>

                  <p>Secondly, <hi>He beholdeth all high things,</hi> that is, he beholdeth them with diſdain, as if this were a ſignification of the match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs pride of Leviathan: He looks upon high things, how high ſoever they are, as his underlings, or as if they were not good enough for him, to beſtow a look, or a caſt of his eye upon. He is (as one gives his character) pride throughout, or nothing elſe but a piece of pride, extreamly proud.<note place="margin">Videre pro con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temnare. Totus ſuperbia eſt. <hi>Nicetas.</hi>
                     </note> Thus to behold is to contemn, and in that ſence we find it uſed in many Scriptures; ſo ſome expound that (<hi>Cant.</hi> 1.6.) <hi>Look not upon me, becauſe I am black, becauſe the ſun hath looked upon me,</hi> that is, do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn me (ſaith the Church) becauſe of my blackneſs by perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So (<hi>Job</hi> 37.24.) <hi>He</hi> (that is, God) <hi>reſpecteth not any that are wiſe of heart:</hi> The Lord looks upon the wiſeſt men of the world, as unworthy of a look; he looks upon them as infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely below him; and if any are proud of their wiſdom, he looks upon them with diſdain, he beholds them, and deſpiſeth them and their wiſdom. It is ſaid of <hi>Goliah</hi> (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.42.)
<pb n="780" facs="tcp:48669:403"/> when <hi>David</hi> came to him, <hi>he beheld him and diſdained him,</hi> that is, he beheld him with diſdain: When the Giant looked about, and ſaw <hi>David</hi> a youth, he diſdained him as no match for him. Leviathan is ſuch a <hi>Goliah, He beholdeth all high things,</hi> be they never ſo high, with a kind of diſdain.</p>
                  <p>Hence, Note;
<q>They who are great in any kind, are very apt to deſpiſe others, or to look upon them with diſdain, as if they were nothing to them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Looks of diſdain, deſpiſing looks, are very common in the world. With what a diſdainful eye did the <hi>Phariſee</hi> behold the <hi>Publican (Luke</hi> 18.9, 11.) <hi>I am not as other men are, Extortio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſt, Adulterers, or even as this Publican,</hi> this pittiful fellow. Pride in ſelf, is always accompanied with contempt of others, and cauſeth it. The Title of that Parable in the 16th of <hi>Luke</hi> is, <hi>He ſpake this Parable, to certain that truſted in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that they were righteous, and deſpiſed others.</hi> 'Tis the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of a Leviathan, he beholds all high things, how much more low things with diſdain. Yet,</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Some expound theſe words as an argument, not of the pride,<note place="margin">Nihil medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, non mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num eſt peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riphraſis ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi res magnas conſectantis. ſc. reſpicere ad id quod ſublime eſt, et nunquam in re humili ſenſum, aut in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentionem defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gere. <hi>Sanct.</hi> Non vacat ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iguis rebus ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſe <hi>Jovi.</hi>
                     </note> but greatneſs and nobleneſs of Leviathans ſpirit, who as he is the higheſt of elementary animals, ſo he beholds all high things, he will not meddle with inferiour matters, they are below him. Great men are for great matters. The Heathens ſaid of their <hi>Jupiter, He had no leiſure to attend upon, or have to do with ſmall affairs.</hi> Small matters will not go down with Leviathan, he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes looking at great. Such is the ſpirit of worldly men; they like Leviathan, behold all high things; not the high things of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but the high things of earth; they are not heavenly-minded, but high-minded. A godly man is heavenly-minded, a carnal man is high-minded. <hi>David</hi> profeſſed (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 131.1.) <hi>Lord, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty, neither do I exerciſe my ſelf in great matters, in things too high for me.</hi> What was too high for a King? for a <hi>David?</hi> yet King <hi>David</hi> ſaid, his heart was not haughty, nor his eyes lofty, looking at high things; he looked at thoſe things which concerned his duty, to ſerve God, and <hi>his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, by the will of God,</hi> or as God would have him (<hi>Acts</hi> 13.36.) he was heavenly-minded, and not high-minded. <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> ſpeaks of a generation (<hi>Prov.</hi> 30.13.) <hi>O how lofty are their
<pb n="781" facs="tcp:48669:403"/> eyes, and their eye-lids are lifted up.</hi> What generation was this?<note place="margin">Habet hoc magnanimus, ut mediocribus contentus, maxima negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat. <hi>Sen.</hi> Superbus vero puſillum ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum habet, er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go nunquam mediocribus contentus eſt, ſed inhiat ad majora.</note> It was the generation of proud, vain, men; O how lofty are their eyes! who can tell how lofty they are! no mean thing will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent them. They have ſuch a hunger after high things, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing low is food for them. A godly man is not ſatisfied with matters which are truly low and ſmall (to him the greateſt things in the world are ſo) yet the lower, the leſſer, the leaſt things of this world will ſerve his turn, as to contentation with them. <hi>Leviathan beholdeth all high things,</hi> and therefore as it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
<q>He is a King over all the children of pride.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>That is, he is <hi>the chief of all proud ones.</hi>
                  </p>

Thus ſeveral render it, according to the ſtrict words of the Hebrew, <hi>he is a King over all wild beaſts.</hi> The Septuagint tranſlate, <hi>he is a King over all that are in, or that inhabit the waters;</hi> others, that move upon the earth, as the learned Reader may ſee in the margin. Now, becauſe thoſe wild ones, of one kind or another, are proud, and prouder than tame beaſts; therefore we render, <hi>He is a King over all the children of pride:</hi> That's an Hebraiſme, <hi>children of pride,</hi> for proud children, or for thoſe that are extreamly proud. They who excel in any thing are ellegantly called the children of it, as if they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten by it, or born of it; they bear the likeneſs of it, as chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren do of a parent. Some perſons (as Leviathan here) are ſo like pride, that they may well be called children of pride, as if pride it ſelf had begotten them, and were their father, or the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that brought them forth and nurſed them, or brought them up.</p>
                  <p>But why is Leviathan called <hi>a King over all the children of pride?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I conceive the chief reaſon to be that which I ſhall give in this Obſervation, becauſe
<q>Leviathan hath more to be proud of, than the proudeſt of the world.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>They that have moſt to be proud of in nature, have not ſo
<pb n="782" facs="tcp:48669:404"/> much to be proud of as Leviathan. What had any natural man (as to the body) to be proud of in compariſon of him? is he proud of his ſtrength? 'tis weakneſs to the ſtrength of Levia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than. Is he proud of his comelineſs, or the exact compoſure of his body? Leviathan excels him in that. In many particulars Leviathan hath that in him, which may occaſion pride, or him to be proud beyond thouſands. And we may conceive, that the reaſon why the Lord brings this in the cloſe, is to humble <hi>Job,</hi> who had carried it too proudly,<note place="margin">In ſuperbis nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rationem ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minat, ut oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat hoc praeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puè <hi>Job</hi> fuiſſe timendum, ne Diabolus qui cum expetierat adtentandum praecipuè eum ad ſuperbium inducere cona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retur. <hi>Aquin.</hi>
                     </note> and ſtoutly towards God. And therefore <hi>Job</hi> was ſpecially to beware of this, leſt the Devil, who deſired to tempt him, ſhould prevail upon him, by ſuggeſting proud and high thoughts of himſelf, and ſo make him a ſubject of his own kingdom; for he is that myſtical Leviathan, who kings it to purpoſe over the children of pride. As if the Lord had ſaid to <hi>Job, Lay down all thoughts and words, which have any ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour or tincture of pride. Wilt thou be proud of this, or that, or any thing? know that in his kind, I have given more to Leviathan to be proud of, than to thee: And conſider under whom thou art to reckon thy ſelf, if thou art lifted up in pride, even under Leviathan, for he is a King over all the children of pride. And though Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>athan be exceeding proud and haughty, yet I can quickly bring him down; ſurely, then I can bring thee down, yet more than hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto I have done. Therefore, O</hi> Job, <hi>do not contend any more with me, be not unquiet under my hand, who am indeed thy King.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Lapſi videntur qui hoc de Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viathan, vel etiam de Sata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na interpretati ſunt. <hi>Coc.</hi> Tenebras offu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit interpreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, omiſſio re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lativi, <hi>&amp;c.

                     </note>This leads me to another reading of the verſe, which makes the antecedent to <hi>he,</hi> not Leviathan, not the Devil, but <hi>God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He that beholdeth all high things, is a King over all the children of pride;</hi> That is, God, who beholdeth all high things, and is <hi>higher than the higheſt (Eccleſ.</hi> 5.8.) he is above the proudeſt men. So then theſe words, <hi>he beholdeth all high things,</hi> having the Relative <hi>That</hi> ſupplyed, are a circumlocution of God. God indeed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds all high things, and high perſons: Let men be never ſo high God beholds them. And as he beholdeth all things, ſo he is higher than the higheſt things, <hi>he is a King over all the children of pride,</hi> who are the higheſt among men, or high above all men in their own conceit. The Lord, as a King, can rule and over-rule the proud, he can bring down their high looks; the Lord ſaid to <hi>Job</hi> (which may give ſome light to this interpretation) when he would
<pb n="783" facs="tcp:48669:404"/> ſtir him up, to conſider himſelf what he was able to do, and to do his beſt (<hi>chap.</hi> 40.12.) <hi>Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low.</hi> Canſt thou do it? canſt thou look on every one that is proud, and bring him low? Thou canſt not, but I can. God beholdeth all high things, he hath them all before him, and is a King over them; he can make the proudeſt, and ſtouteſt, and greateſt that are in the world ſtoop to him. That Great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> who lorded it over the greateſt of the world in his days, was at laſt brought to confeſs, that the Lord was a King over all the children of pride (<hi>Dan.</hi> 4.37.) <hi>Now I</hi> Nebuchadnezzar <hi>praiſe, and extol, and honour the King of heaven, all whoſe works are truth, and his ways are judgment, and thoſe that walk in pride he is able to abaſe.</hi> In this ſence God is a King over all the children of pride.</p>
                  <p>Now though the words, according to the ſenſe given of this laſt reading, may ſafely be applied to God; yet as moſt among late Interpreters underſtand them literally of Leviathan, ſo many of the antients, who have written upon this Book, turn this whole deſcription of Leviathan into an Allegory of the Devil (as was toucht before) and to make it out they have run into many need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſpeculations. But I conceive, though it be true, that many things ſpoken of Leviathan are applicable to the Devil, as alſo to Tyrants, to Antichriſt, and all wicked men; and ſome, who are very ſparing in urging the Allegory, yet grant we may, when we read what is ſaid of Leviathan, reflect upon the Devil, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what a mighty power he hath to do miſchief, if the goodneſs and power of God did not reſtrain him: Yet 'tis ſafeſt to keep to the plain ſenſe, and not to buſie our ſelves much in transforming the holy Scriptures into Allegories, in which ſome have been over-bold; nor ſhould any venture to draw Allegories, but out of a natural meaning, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> did in the 4th Chapter of his Epiſtle to the <hi>Galathians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall only adde, that as from the nature of this Leviathan (ſuppoſed to be the Whale) we may receive many inſtructions; ſo the Lord doth ſometimes Preach or Propheſie to whole Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by him, that is, he gives warning by him to Nations, of ſome great things which ſhall come to paſs among them. 'Tis the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of an Interpreter upon this place. <hi>God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies
<pb n="784" facs="tcp:48669:405"/> to people and nations by the Whale or Leviathan.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Deus catos quaſi poeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae precones facit, dum inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litis locis appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes bella, &amp; alias clades nuncient ut homines poeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiam agant. <hi>Scult.</hi>
                     </note> And as other places (he was a <hi>Germane</hi>) ſo we, have had warnings by him; <hi>for</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in the year</hi> 1620, <hi>there was a Whale caſt upon the ſhore of a great river far within the land, twenty and five ells long and a half, immediately before the great wars, changes, and troubles which befel</hi> Germany. Hence he infers, when theſe mighty fiſhes come into places which are out of their way and road, or when God caſts them upon unwonted ſhores, it fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhews ſome unwonted thing, or that God will bring gueſts among them, that they never thought of.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have done with this long and large deſcription, which the Lord makes of Leviathan. There remains only one chapter more, which gives us the full effect and iſſue of all the dealings of God with <hi>Job,</hi> and of his ſpeakings to <hi>Job,</hi> about Behemoth and Leviathan: All was to humble him; and we ſhall ſee him deeply humbled, and eminently reſtored, in the next chapter.</p>

                  <p>Fourthly, The Iſſue or Effect of all this, and that is his repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, <hi>Wherefore I abhor my ſelf, and repent in dust and aſhes.</hi> Thus we have both the general parts of the whole Chapter, and the more particular reſolution of this firſt part, which I call <hi>Jobs</hi> humiliation. And in this manner he humbled himſelf before the Lord (as followeth.</p>

                        <hi>Verſ. 1.</hi>
                     </bibl> Then <hi>Job</hi> anſwered the Lord, and ſaid.</q>
                  <p>Theſe are the words of the Divine Hiſtorian, connecting this Chapter with the former. And all that I ſhall ſay upon this firſt
<pb n="787" facs="tcp:48669:406"/> firſt verſe, ſhall be but to Anſwer this Queſtion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>How came it to paſs, that</hi> Job <hi>anſwered the Lord again, ſeing he had profeſſed before</hi> (chap. 40.5.) <hi>that he would anſwer no more? Once have I ſpoken, but I will not anſwer; yea, twice, but I will proceed no further.</hi> There <hi>Job</hi> ſeemed to take up a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to anſwer no more; how is it then, that here this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter beginneth with, <hi>Then</hi> Job <hi>anſwered the Lord and ſaid?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall give a three-fold anſwer to this doubt.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Thus; we may conceive, <hi>Job,</hi> in the former promiſe, that he would anſwer no more, meant it of ſuch a kind of anſwer as he had given the Lord, and his friends before; he would an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer no more in that way, or after that ſort; and ſo it was not an abſolute reſolve not to anſwer, but not to anſwer as he had done: As if he had ſaid, I will anſwer no more, juſtifying my ſelf, no, nor ſo much as excuſing my ſelf, or taking off the weight of any charge the Lord hath brought againſt me: There being ſuch a change in his anſwer, he may very well be ſaid to anſwer no more; for he anſwered no more, as once he did. The beſt and ſafeſt way of juſtifying and excuſing our ſelves, is to lay our ſelves at the foot of God: A confeſſion of, or a charging our ſelves with our ſins is the beſt way of acquitting our ſelves before God from our ſins; I mean, 'tis the beſt that we can do to juſtifie or acquit our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we may anſwer thus. 'Tis true, <hi>Job</hi> ſaid he would anſwer no more, but it is as true that the Lord commanded him to anſwer again (<hi>chap.</hi> 40.1.) For when <hi>Job</hi> had ſaid there at the fifth verſe, <hi>Once have I ſpoken, but I will not anſwer, yea, twice, but I will proceed no further:</hi> The Lord ſaith at the (7th verſe) <hi>Gird up thy loyns like a man: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.</hi> God called him forth, and bad him ſpeak, I have ſomewhat to ſay to thee, and do thou anſwer me; ſo that the Lord took off <hi>Job,</hi> or releaſed him from that bond, that he had put upon himſelf: Thou haſt ſaid, thou wilt anſwer no more, but I will have thee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer yet more. Now though we take up a reſolve to do, or not to do ſuch a thing, yet a word from God muſt over-rule us. As a word from God muſt over-rule us, not to do what we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to do; ſo a word from God muſt over-rule us, to do that which we have reſolved not to do.</p>
                  <pb n="788" facs="tcp:48669:407"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Lord had not only given <hi>Job</hi> a command to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, but inclined, and moved his heart to anſwer. The reaſon why <hi>Job</hi> reſolved not to anſwer, was the lowneſs of his own ſpirit, and the terror of the Lord that was upon him. The majeſty and dread of the Lord put him upon a reſolve for ſilence; but now ſome favour appearing, and the Lord giving him hopes of a gracious acceptance, he was encouraged to ſpeak, and had a freedom of ſpeech reſtored to him, and accordingly he <hi>anſwered the Lord.</hi> Thus we may ſalve <hi>Jobs</hi> credit from lightneſs, much more from a lie; though after he had ſaid, he would anſwer no more, we find him anſwering again, <hi>Then</hi> Job <hi>anſwered the Lord and ſaid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Lord having ſet forth his own infinite power and wiſdom, in that long and accurate ſpeech, which he made out of the whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind, concerning his works of creation and providence; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, by his diſcourſe about that <hi>unparallel'd pair, Behemoth and Leviathan,</hi> the greateſt of living creatures upon the land, and in the ſea: I ſay, the Lord having by this diſcourſe humbled <hi>Job,</hi> he ſaw, and was convinced there was no diſputing with God, nor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring into, much leſs complaining of, or murmuring at his ſecret counſels and judgments; he now ſaw, it was not for him to call God to an account about any of his dealings and proceedings, as ſometimes he had done, but rather to adore them: and therefore he ſubmits, and anſwers only with exalting God, and abaſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. He begins with the exaltation of God, <hi>Then</hi> Job <hi>anſwered the Lord and ſaid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <bibl>
                        <hi>Verſ. 2.</hi>
                     </bibl> I know that thou canſt do every thing.</q>
                  <p>That's his firſt word; and it teacheth us, That, <hi>when we begin to have high and great thoughts of God, we cannot but have low and mean thoughts of our ſelves.</hi> Our own humiliation begins at the exaltation of God; and our ſelf-emptineſs and weakneſs, at the ſight of his fulneſs and Almightineſs. Thus <hi>Job</hi> began his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, <hi>I know that thou canſt do every thing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This verſe exalts God both in his <hi>omnipotency,</hi> and in his <hi>omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciency.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Non exigit à nobis Deus multa verba, ſed multam fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem.</note> 'Tis a ſhort, yet a full confeſſion of his faith in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and though it were ſhort, yet it pleaſed God much and fully, becauſe <hi>Job</hi> uttered it in much faith. <hi>A few words pleaſe God, where he ſeeth much faith.</hi>

                  <q>I know.</q>
                  <p>The word notes a certain knowledge, ſuch a knowledge as leaveth no place for doubting, nor for an uncertain opinionating. <hi>I know,</hi> is as much as, <hi>I am aſſured:</hi> As <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> when he told him <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> was his firſt born (<hi>Gen.</hi> 48.19.) <hi>I know it, my ſon, I know it,</hi> &amp;c. As if he had ſaid, I do not lay my right hand upon the younger by miſtake, but choice; I know very well which is the firſt-born, and I know what I do, in laying my right hand upon the younger. Thus ſaith <hi>Job</hi> here, <hi>I know that thou canſt do every thing.</hi> This great truth is fixed and fully ſettled upon my heart; and I urge my ſelf with all my might now, to give thee the glory of it, though ſometimes under my grievous pains and undue paſſions, I have obſcured it, and ſpoken as if I doubted, or were not well aſſured of it. <hi>I know,</hi>

                  <p>Again, It ſignifies not only a power of doing, but a prevailing power of doing, or a conquering power, a power that overcomes all difficulties, and removes all obſtacles or obſtructions; ſuch a power is intended in this word. We have it in a proper name (<hi>Prov.</hi> 30.1.) <hi>The words of</hi> Agur, <hi>the ſon of</hi> Jakeh, <hi>even the propheſie. The man ſpake unto</hi> Ithiel, <hi>even unto</hi> Ithiel <hi>and</hi> Ucal: Under both theſe names, <hi>Ithiel</hi> and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>cal,</hi> ſome conceive Chriſt is to be underſtood: he is <hi>Ithiel,</hi> which ſignifies (as <hi>Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel) God with us;</hi> and he is <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>cal,</hi> that is, powerful and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty. When the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> would ſhew how ſtrongly that people were bent to ſin, he ſpeaks to them all as one man (<hi>Jer.</hi> 3.5.) <hi>Behold, thou haſt ſpoken, and done evil, as thou couldſt;</hi> that is, thou haſt put forth thy <hi>utmoſt Can,</hi> thou haſt done as much evil as thou canſt. As here, <hi>Job</hi> ſaith of the Lord, <hi>Thou canſt do all things.</hi> So ſaid the Prophet of the people, <hi>Thou haſt ſpoken, and done evil, as thou couldſt.</hi> A godly man ſins, but he doth not ſin as he can, he doth not lay his utmoſt ſtrength,
<pb n="790" facs="tcp:48669:408"/> nor ſet his ſhoulders to it; but an evil man doth evil as he can, he ſerves his luſt as he ſhould ſerve God, with all his might. I urge that place only to note the force of the word, <hi>I know that thou canſt do</hi>
                     <q>Every thing.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>That is, every thing which is fit for, and becoming thy Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty to do, every thing which is good, every thing which is juſt, every thing which doth not reflect diſhonour upon thy name, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing that is not a contradiction to thy ſelf. Thus, take things of what kind you will, God can do them; and take things in what degree you will, God can do them: he can do, not only little things, but great things, yea, the greateſt things. Great and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle make no matter of difference with God. As if <hi>Job</hi> had ſaid, <hi>O Lord, I know and acknowledge there is nothing too hard for thee, yea, nothing is hard to thee; and that as thy counſels and decrees are altogether wiſe and juſt, ſo thou haſt power enough to execute and bring them about. Thou canſt do</hi>
                     <q>Every thing.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is no bound to the power of God, except his own will. God will not do every thing that he can, but he can do every thing that he willeth: nothing can ſtop the power of God in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, where his will is to do. <hi>Thou canſt do every thing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Or we may take it thus, <hi>God can do every thing;</hi> that is, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing that he hath ſaid he will do, every thing that he hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged himſelf to do by promiſe, or by propheſie; he hath power to do what he hath ſaid or fore-ſhewed ſhall be done. Thus <hi>Job</hi> gives glory to God, and begins as <hi>David (Pſal.</hi> 59.16, 17.) <hi>to ſing of the power of the Lord, as well as of his mercy. I will ſing of thy power; unto thee, O my ſtrength, will I ſing.</hi> Here <hi>Job</hi> ſings of the power of God, <hi>I know that thou canſt do every thing.</hi> The words have no difficulty in them; only when <hi>Job</hi> ſaith here, <hi>I know that thou canſt do every thing,</hi> it may be queſtioned,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Did not</hi> Job <hi>know this before?</hi> yea, <hi>had not</hi> Job <hi>ſaid as much as this before?</hi> that God could do every thing. In ſeveral paſſages of the ninth and twelfth Chapters, he ſaid as much as this, and more cannot be ſaid of God. We have ſaid every thing of God, when once we have ſaid, he can do every thing. There <hi>Job</hi> cryes
<pb n="791" facs="tcp:48669:408"/> up the power of God, together with his wiſdom (<hi>verſ.</hi> 4. &amp;c.) <hi>He is wiſe in heart, and mighty in ſtrength; who hath hardned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf againſt him and proſpered?</hi> If any ask, what can God do? <hi>Job</hi> anſwers, <hi>He can remove the mountains, and overturn them in his anger, he ſhaketh the earth out of its place, he commandeth the Sun, and it riſeth not, and ſealeth up the Stars, he alone ſpreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of the Sea.</hi> All theſe are ſpeakings forth of the Almightineſs of God; and he that can do theſe things, ſurely can do all things. Now ſeeing <hi>Job</hi> was there ſo much upon this point before, how is it that here he ſaith, <hi>I know that thou canſt do every thing?</hi> as if this were ſome new matter which he was not acquainted with before, or had never ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, it is true, <hi>Job</hi> knew this before, but he did not know it before as he knew it now: Though he knew the Lords power before, and ſpake of it, yet the trouble of his ſpirit, and the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of his ſoul under his ſufferings, did very much darken him as to this knowledge; and therefore when <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>I know that thou canſt do every thing,</hi> this knowing is not to be underſtood as oppoſed to ignorance only, as if <hi>Job</hi> knew this now, and did not know it at all before; but knowing here is oppoſed to a leſſer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of knowledge, or knowing here imports a higher and greater degree of knowledge than ever he had before concerning the power of God. <hi>Job</hi> ſpake ſometimes before, as if he knew little of this great truth, and he much detracted from the abſolute power of God over all creatures by his complainings, eſpecially that he and other innocent ones were afflicted; as alſo, by his earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt deſire of knowing why he was afflicted, being innocent, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by intimating, that he was not ſo well ſatisfied in the dealing of God with him, nor had wholly reſigned up himſelf to the ſoveraign power and will of God, to be diſpoſed of at his pleaſure; ſo that in this ſhort confeſſion <hi>Job</hi> ſeems to ſpeak more largely, thus; <hi>Now at length, O Lord, I know more fully than ever, that thou haſt a moſt juſt right and power to command and diſpoſe of all things, and that thou both doſt and mayſt effect whatſoever pleaſeth thee; nor ought any to murmur at, much leſs reſiſt thy counſels or dealings, ſeeing every thing is, and cannot but be juſt and righteous which thou doſt.</hi> We conclude then, <hi>Job</hi> knew this truth before, but not as he knew it now.</p>
                  <pb n="792" facs="tcp:48669:409"/>
                  <p>Hence note, Firſt;
<q>Knowledge is a growing thing.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And it were well if we were all found growing in knowledge. That's the Apoſtle <hi>Peters</hi> charge (2 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 3.18.) <hi>Grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Christ.</hi> He puts both together. There is a growth in knowledge as well as in grace; and in proportion to our ſpiritual growth in knowledge, is our growth in grace: for, though many grow much in notional and ſpeculative knowledge, who grow little in grace; yet they cannot but grow much in grace, who grow much in ſpiritual and experimental knowledge. As a godly man groweth in knowledge, ſo in grace too. Knowledge is a growing thing. The riſing and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing waters of the Sanctuary were a type of the encreaſings of knowledge; thoſe waters were firſt to the ancles, and then to the knees, and then to the loyns, and then to the neck. And as knowledge increaſeth, with reſpect to the ſeveral times and ſtates of the Church (for ſo that place (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 47.3, 4, 5.) is to be be underſtood) ſo it is a truth, that there is an increaſe of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, with reſpect to the ſtate of every particular believer; his knowledge is firſt to the ancles, and then to the knees, and then to the loyns, and then to the neck. As ſome points to be known are ſo eaſie or ſhallow, that (according to that clear and common ſimilitude) a Lamb may wade through them; others ſo difficult and deep, that an Elephant may ſwim in them: ſo the degree of knowledge in the ſame perſon, which at one time was very ſmall and ſhallow, at another time may be ſwelled into a great deep, and he called a man of deep knowledge. We have a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral promiſe of ſuch an increaſe (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.9.) <hi>The earth ſhall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the Sea;</hi> that is, there ſhall be a wonderful increaſe of knowledge. That's alſo the import of <hi>Daniels</hi> Propheſie (Chap. 12.4) <hi>Many ſhall run to and fro, and knowledge ſhall be increaſed.</hi> Particular perſons ſhall improve in knowledge, and ſo ſhall the whole Church. So then, this increaſe of knowledge is of two ſorts; Firſt, it is a knowledge of more things; and, Secondly, of every thing more.</p>
                  <p>We ſhould labour to know more truths; we muſt thus add to our knowledge. For, though it be true, that every believer hath
<pb n="793" facs="tcp:48669:409"/> received the anointing, whereby he knoweth all things that are of abſolute neceſſity (1 <hi>John</hi> 2.20.) yet he may come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of more things which are exceeding uſeful and helpful to him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We ſhould labour to know every thing more, as in the Text. <hi>Job</hi> knew before that God was omnipotent, and could do all things; but now he knew it more, and ſo much more, that the knowledge which he had before might be called ignorance, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the knowledge which he had now received. Then we increaſe our knowledge fully, when we get the knowledge of more things, and of every thing more.</p>
                  <p>Again, we ſhould labour to increaſe, as in ſpeculative, ſo in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental knowledge. Speculative knowledge alone, goes no further than the notion of what we know; experimental know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge finds and feels the power of what we know, it ſubjects us, or makes us ſubject to what we know; the motions of the Will follow the light and dictate of the Underſtanding. This is the beſt knowledge: Knowledge which is felt and acted, is better than that which is heard and declared. What the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſaid of himſelf, and his fellow Apoſtles, who were perſonally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with Chriſt while here on earth, with reſpect to their ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive knowledge of him, is moſt true of the ſpiritual and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimental knowledge which believers have of Chriſt now in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and they abſent from him (1 <hi>John</hi> 1.1.) <hi>That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have ſeen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled of the word of life, that declare we unto you;</hi> we declare that unto you which we have ſeen and felt. 'Tis a bleſſed thing, when we can ſay, that the things which we declare to others, we have felt them, and even handled them our ſelves. Many (as our uſual ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion is) handle Texts, and handle truths learnedly and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently in a diſcourſe, who never handled, no nor ſo much as toucht them by any experience of their ſweetneſs or efficacy, either in their hearts or lives.</p>
                  <p>Further, conſider in what way <hi>Job</hi> came to this proficiency in knowledge; he had been a great while in the School of affliction, before he ſaid, <hi>I know,</hi> and <hi>I know</hi> to purpoſe, <hi>that thou canſt do every thing.</hi>

                  <p>Hence note;
<q>Afflictions and ſufferings are a ſpecial means to increaſe our knowledge, and wiſe us in the things of God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The godly never increaſe more in knowledge, than under the Croſs, under afflictions of one kind or another. <hi>David</hi> ſaith (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.71.) <hi>It is good for me that I have been afflicted, that I might learn thy ſtatutes.</hi> Did not <hi>David</hi> know the Statutes of God before? doubtleſs he did; he was all-along trained up in the ſtatutes of God; but when God took him into the School of affliction, then he lea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nt the Statutes of God much better. Let us conſider what profiting we find at any time under affliction, as to the knowledge of God, and of our ſelves; if we do not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our knowledge by one croſs, we may expect to meet with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and another, till matters mend with us. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, (<hi>Prov.</hi> 27.22.) <hi>Though thou ſhouldſt bray a fool in a morter, among wheat, with a peſtle, yet will not his fooliſhneſs depart from him;</hi> that is, an obſtinate ſinner (he is the fool there ſpoken of) though extreamly afflicted, is not bettered: but a godly man profits by his affliction, both as to the departure and riddance of his folly, as alſo to his growth in ſpiritual experimental knowledge.</p>
                  <p>Once more (which will give us a third note) <hi>Job</hi> was not only in affliction, but God taught him in his affliction; <hi>Job</hi> had not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a rod upon his back, but a tutor by his ſide. His three friends had been long with him, and ſpoken much to him, but he learnt little by them. When <hi>Elihu</hi> had been ſpeaking to him, he yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſomewhat to him, though not fully; but when once God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to tutor and inſtruct him, <hi>Job</hi> learned amain, and profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed greatly in knowledge.</p>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>Then we profit indeed under afflictions, when God teacheth us in our afflictions.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>If we have nothing but the rod, we profit not by the rod; yea, if we have nothing but the Word, we ſhall never profit by the Word. It is the Spirit given with the Word, and the Spirit given with the rod, by which we profit under both, or either. (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 94.12.) <hi>Bleſſed is the man</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) whom thou cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteneſt, and teacheſt out of thy Law.</hi> Chaſtning and divine teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="795" facs="tcp:48669:410"/> muſt go together, elſe there will be no profiting by chaſtning. God was <hi>Jobs</hi> teacher as well as his chaſtner; <hi>Job</hi> received many leſſons from God, he taught him quire through the 38th and 39th Chapters, and he taught him quite through two Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters more, before he ſaid, <hi>I know that thou canſt do every thing.</hi> Thus far of <hi>Jobs</hi> knowledge. Let us a little conſider the firſt object of it here expreſſed, the omnipotence of God, <hi>I know</hi>
                     <q>That thou canſt do every thing.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence obſerve, Firſt;
<q>God is good at any work.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>That is, at any work that is good; he can do every ſuch thing, nothing comes amiſs to him. Among men, one man can do this thing, and another can do that thing, and a third can do more than either; but where will you find a man that can do every thing? One man is for counſel, another for action; one man can build a houſe, and another can till the ground; ſeveral men have their ſeveral arts and myſteries, and it is well if one man can do any one thing well: But God is for all. We have a ſaying (and 'tis a great truth) <hi>He that will be doing of every thing,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Aliquis in om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus, nullus in ſingulis.</note> 
                     <hi>is no great doer in any thing;</hi> that is, he never excels in any. But as the Lord can do every thing, ſo he is exact and perfect in every thing that he doth. The beſt creature is only a particular good, but God is an univerſal good; there is every good in God: all the good that is ſcattered in the creature, is eminently in him. Now as God is an univerſal good, ſo he is an univerſal Agent; he is in working, as he is in Being; <hi>He can do every thing for us,</hi> as well as be every thing to us. We need not fear if we bring this or that thing to God, that he hath no skill in it, as it is with men; if you bring this thing to a man, he is excellent at it; but bring another thing, and he knoweth not how to turn his hand to it: but whatſoever we have to do, if it be according to the will of God, he hath power and wiſdom enough to do it. The Lord had power enough to give a being to all creatures; and hath he not power enough to do all things in and about the creature? cannot he preſerve in all dangers, and provide in all wants? cannot he furniſh with all gifts, and give ſucceſs? cannot he overthrow the high, and exalt the low? cannot be reſtrain the wrathful, and ſubdue the obſtinate?
<pb n="796" facs="tcp:48669:411"/> cannot he weaken the ſtrong, and ſtrengthen the weak? cannot he make fools wiſe, and wiſe men fooliſh? ſurely he can do all theſe things, for he can do every thing.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, from theſe words take that grand aſſertion.</p>
                  <q>God is omnipotent, his power is infinite.</q>
                  <p>This is a principle, one of the great principles of Religion, an Article of Faith; yet I ſhall not enlarge upon it, having met with it in other places of this book. Only conſider here, how <hi>Job</hi> infers this principle; he infers it from the diſcourſe which the Lord was pleaſed to have with him, in the four former Chapters, wherein the Lord told him of many things that he had done; I have done this and that in the heavens above, and in the earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, I have made <hi>Behemeth</hi> and <hi>Leviathan:</hi> God had told him of his doings;<note place="margin">Ex mirabilibus recenſites ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit <hi>Job</hi> at<expan>

                     </note> whence <hi>Job</hi> inferred, <hi>I know thou canſt do eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing.</hi> He doth not make this concluſion by way of induction (there is ſuch a way of argumentation in Logick) but by dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. God hath done this and that, and the other, therefore he can do all things; if he can do this, what cannot he do? if he can make and ſubdue <hi>Behemoth,</hi> what cannot he do? and if he can make and maſter <hi>Leviathan,</hi> what cannot he do? Chriſt (<hi>Luke</hi> 5.20.) argueth his omnipotency or Godhead in the ſame manner; for having healed a poor man, and ſaid unto him, <hi>Man, thy ſins are forgiven thee,</hi> the Phariſees were very much offended with that word, ſaying, <hi>Who is this that ſpeaketh blaſphemy? who can forgive ſins but God alone?</hi> Chriſt knowing their thoughts, ſaid, <hi>What reaſon ye in your hearts? whether is it eaſier to ſay, thy ſins are forgiven thee, or to ſay, riſe up and walk?</hi> I have heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the man; doth not that argue a divine power? why may not I then ſay, <hi>Thy ſins are forgiven thee?</hi> He that can by his own might do one mighty or miraculous thing, can do all things. Such is the power of God, that, as I ſaid before, he hath no limit to it, but his own will.</p>
                  <p>And ſeeing the will of God is the limit of his power, let us take heed of deſiring him who can do every thing, to do any thing for us, which is not according to his will. Let us bound our deſires; let us take heed of ſaying, this is our deſire, and God can do every thing, therefore this which we deſire. Conſider, is your deſire according to the will of God. We cannot urge God with his Omnipotency, to do any thing that is our deſire, if we are
<pb n="797" facs="tcp:48669:411"/> not firſt clear in it, that our deſire is agreeable to his will: Unleſs we have a rule for our deſire, or we deſire by rule, we can have no well-grounded confidence, that God will do that for us, which we deſire. God is almighty, not to do what we will or forge in our brain, but to do what himſelf willeth. Papiſts ſay, the bread is turned into the very body of Chriſt; but ſay we, we ſee, and feel, and taſt but bread: They preſently fly to this, <hi>God is able to do all things, or he can do every thing;</hi> this is, to abuſe the Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency of God: Hath the Scripture declared any ſuch thing? yea, hath not the Scripture declared the quite contrary, that Sacraments are but ſigns of things, not the things themſelves. <hi>This is my body,</hi> ſaid Chriſt; but he ſaid not, <hi>my body is this.</hi> Chriſt willed that his body ſhould be repreſented by bread; he will not that bread ſhould be changed into his body. The power of God muſt not be urged beyond his will. He have no revelation of the will of God, that he will tranſubſtantiate the bread at the holy ſupper into the body of Chriſt; but he hath given it as a ſacred ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bole of Chriſts crucified and broken body, upon which we are to feed by faith.</p>
                  <p>That God can do whatſoever he willeth, hath a two-fold uſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Of comfort, to all true believers,<note place="margin">Noſtrae difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates Deo per faciles ſunt.</note> who ſtand in the grace of the Covenant. That nothing is too hard for God, is a marve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Conſolation to us in all our hardſhips. When God promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Abraham</hi> a Son in his old age (<hi>Gen.</hi> 18.) what a hard task was here for God? <hi>Sarah</hi> could not believe it, ſhe laughed; but what ſaith the Lord? <hi>Is any thing too hard for me?</hi> he preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly urgeth his own power, where he had declared his will. Whatſoever God hath declared to be his will, either as to particular perſons, or the whole Church; it matters not how hard it is, if we have but his will for it. As Chriſt will at laſt <hi>Change our vile body, that it may be faſhioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working, whereby he is able even to ſubdue all things unto himſelf</hi> (Phil. 3.21.) ſo according to that working, he is able to change and ſubdue all things to and according to his own will. When the <hi>Jews</hi> were to be carried into captivity to <hi>Babylon,</hi> the Lord commanded <hi>Jeremy</hi> to make purchaſe of a field in <hi>Anathoth</hi> (Jer. 32.7, 8, 9.) Now <hi>Jeremy</hi> might object; behold, the <hi>Chaldaeans</hi> are come to the City to take it; and ſhall I go and buy land? Is this a time to make purchaſes? is this a
<pb n="798" facs="tcp:48669:412"/> time to buy land, when the City is ready to be taken, and the whole land like to be loſt? yes, ſaith God, <hi>Buy the field for money, ſeal the evidences, and take witneſſes; for thus ſaith the God of Iſrael</hi> (verſ. 15.) <hi>houſes, and fields, and vineyards ſhall be poſſeſſed again in this land.</hi> Am not I able to bring you back again? And therefore after <hi>Jeremy</hi> had confeſſed in prayer to the Lord (<hi>verſ.</hi> 17.) <hi>Nothing is too hard for thee</hi> (The Hebrew is, <hi>hidden from thee, or wonderful to thee;</hi> becauſe hard things are hidden from us, ſtrange and wonderful to us. The Prophet, I ſay, having ſaid this to the Lord in prayer) the Lord ſaid to him (<hi>verſ.</hi> 27.) <hi>Is any thing too hard for me?</hi> And to the ſame point, the Lord ſpake again (<hi>Zech.</hi> 8.6.) <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord of hoſts, if it be marvellous in the eyes of the remnant of this people</hi> (name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhould be reſtored) <hi>ſhould it alſo be marvellous in mine eyes, ſaith the Lord of hoſts,</hi> to perform what was ſaid (<hi>ver.</hi> 4.) <hi>There ſhall yet old men, and old women dwell in the ſtreets of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and every man with his ſtaff in his hand for very age, and the ſtreets of the City ſhall be full of boys and girls, playing in the ſtreets thereof.</hi> Who could beleive this? but it was the will of God it ſhould be ſo: And therefore he ſaid, <hi>If it be marvellous in your eyes,</hi> ſhould it be ſo in mine eyes? You think this can never be brought about. But muſt it needs be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous in my eyes, becauſe it is ſo in yours? or (as the margin hath it) muſt it needs be hard or difficult to me, becauſe 'tis ſo to you? The ſame word which ſignifies <hi>marvellous,</hi> ſignifies <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult,</hi> becauſe that which is difficult and hard we marvel at: But ſaith the Lord, becauſe this thing is marvellous in your eyes, muſt it be ſo in mine, who can do every thing? And we may conceive, that when <hi>Job</hi> ſpake thus, he began to have ſome hope of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration. He had loſt all, children, and health, and ſtrength, and eſtate, all was gone, and he many times gave up all for gone, and ſpake deſpairingly, as to a reſtitution; but now God having ſpoken of what he had done, <hi>Jobs</hi> faith and hope revived in theſe words, <hi>I know that thou canſt do every thing;</hi> and among other things thou canſt reſtore all to me again, thou canſt give me as much health and ſtrength of body, as many children, as full an eſtate, as ever I had.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, This truth is matter of great terrour to the wicked. As God can ſtrengthen the weak, ſo he can weaken the ſtrong; and,
<pb n="799" facs="tcp:48669:412"/> as he can raiſe up the godly, ſo he can eaſily pull down the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly; as he can fill up the vallies, ſo he can level the mountains. Thus the Lord ſpake (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 17.24.) <hi>All the trees of the field ſhall know, that I the Lord have brought down the high tree, have exalted the low tree, have dryed up the green tree, and have made the dry tree to flouriſh; I the Lord have ſpoken, and have done it.</hi> It muſt needs be terrible to the wicked, that God can do what he will, ſeing his will is to deſtroy them, except they repent and turn to him; he hath power enough to do it, and his will is to do it; what then can hinder his doing it, but their repentance for what they have done. <hi>There are no ſons of</hi> Zerviah <hi>too hard for him, who can do every thing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, from the ſecond notion of theſe words, <hi>Thou canſt do every thing,</hi> that is, thou haſt right as well as might to do every thing.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve,
<q>The Lord may do, he hath an unqueſtionable right to do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he is pleaſed to do.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>God gives a law to all others for their actions, but he is the law to himſelf. He can do every thing of right he willeth, as well as he hath might to do what he will.</p>
                  <p>Then let none complain, that God hath done them wrong, for every thing is right which God doth. <hi>Job</hi> had failed in this, by ſpeeches reflecting upon the juſtice of God in his dealings with him; and therefore we may conceive, that in this confeſſion, <hi>I know thou canſt do every thing,</hi> he chiefly aimed at this, to give God the glory of his juſtice: As if he had ſaid, <hi>Though thou, O Lord, layeſt thy hand heavy upon an innocent perſon, and ſtrippeſt him of all that he hath; though thou, O Lord, makeſt a wicked man to flouriſh in this world, and filleſt him with outward felicity; yet all ought to reſt in thy will, for this thou canſt do of right, being abſolute Lord over all. I</hi> (ſaid <hi>Job) know that thou canſt do every thing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>And that no thought can be with-holden from thee.</q>
                  <p>Maſter <hi>Broughton</hi> renders, <hi>that no wiſdom was with-holden from thee;</hi> which he thus gloſſeth. Thou haſt made all things in perfect wiſdom, to ſhew thy eternal power and God-head. The ſame
<pb n="800" facs="tcp:48669:413"/> word ſignifies both <hi>wiſdom and thought,</hi>

There is a difference amongſt Interpreters, whoſe thought we are here to underſtand, when <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>No thought can be with-holden from thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, Many very worthy and learned men, are of opinion, that by thought, we are to underſtand the thought of God, Gods own thought; and ſo theſe words are but the carrying on of the ſame thing, or a further explication what was ſaid before, <hi>I know that thou canſt do every thing;</hi> that is, whatſoever is in thy thought or in thy heart to do; no power in the world can with-hold thee from doing it; <hi>no thought,</hi> that is, not any one of thy thoughts, <hi>can be with-holden from thee,</hi> that is, from thy fulfilling it, or bringing it to paſs: what thou haſt in thy mind, thou wilt perform with thy hand: If thou haſt but a thought to do ſuch a thing, thou canſt not be hindered of thy thought, it ſhall be done.</p>
                  <p>The words hold out a very glorious truth concerning God, if we take <hi>thought</hi> in this ſenſe; and as it is a great truth in it ſelf, ſo it is a very uſeful one to us.</p>
                  <p>The Obſervation is this;
<q>Whatſoever God hath a thought to do, he will do it, he cannot be hindered in the effect of a thought.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>As none of Gods thoughts are vain, ſo none of them are in vain or ineffectual, they all reach their end (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.13.) <hi>I will work, and who ſhall lett it?</hi> God will work if he hath but a thought to work; and if all the Powers in the world ſet themſelves againſt him, they ſhall not be able to diſappoint any one of his thoughts (<hi>Prtv.</hi> 19.21.) <hi>There are many devices in a mans heart, yet the counſel of the Lord ſhall ſtand;</hi> that is, there are many thoughts in mans heart oppoſite to the counſel and thought of God. Men think this and that, they make up many things in their thoughts, yet can make nothing of them, becauſe againſt the thoughts of God; for all the devices that are in mans heart, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hinder the effect of Gods counſel, his counſel ſhall ſtand faſt and firm, without any bowing, without any bending, while their devices fall and are utterly broken. The concluſion of wiſe <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> is (<hi>Prov.</hi> 21.30.) <hi>There is no wiſdom, nor underſtanding,
<pb n="801" facs="tcp:48669:413"/> nor counſel againſt the Lord.</hi> Let men take or give counſel as long as they will againſt the Lord, they cannot avoid the effect of his counſels. We have both theſe, the ſtanding of the Lords coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, and the overthrowing of all counſels that are againſt him, in that one Scripture (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.10, 11.) <hi>The Lord bringeth the counſel of the heathen to nought, he maketh the devices of the people of none effect: The counſel of the Lord ſtandeth for ever, the thoughts of his heart to all generations.</hi> God never loſt a thought: all come to paſs. This ſheweth the mighty efficacy of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of God; this is more than can be ſaid of any man or men in the world; the wiſeſt and greateſt, have had many thoughts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden from them. They have thought to do this and that, but could not effect it, nor bring it about (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 146.4.) <hi>Their thoughts periſh;</hi> they have a great many plots in their heads, but they prove not; they often live to ſee their own thoughts dye. Their thoughts periſh, not only when they dye, but they live to ſee them periſh and dye. The Prophet (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.25.) ſheweth how the Lord fruſtrates the counſels of men, and turneth them backward; he ſhews alſo, that without him they cannot go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward (<hi>Lamen.</hi> 3.37.) <hi>Who is he that ſaith and it cometh to paſs, when the Lord commandeth it not?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But ſome may object, the Lord ſpeaketh of the builders of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,</hi> as <hi>Job</hi> here ſpeaketh of him (<hi>Gen.</hi> 11.6.) <hi>Behold the people is one, and they have all one language, and this they begin to do, and now nothing will be reſtrained from them which they have imagined to do;</hi> as if he had ſaid, there will be no with-holding of them from their thoughts.</p>
                  <p>'Tis very true, amongſt men there was nothing to ſtop them; they being all as one man, and of one mind, would have accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed any thing that they did imagine: but though there was nothing upon earth, nothing among men, that could reſtrain them, yet God could do it, and he did it; he confounded their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and one brought morter, when he ſhould have brought brick; and another brought ſtones, when he ſhould have brought timber; they thought to build a tower that ſhould reach as high as heaven, they would be drowned no more; but they and their thoughts were ſoon ſcattered and blown away.</p>
                  <p>This point hath in it alſo abundance of comfort (as the former) for take thought for the thought of God, and it runs parallel with
<pb n="802" facs="tcp:48669:414"/> what I ſpake before, of the work of God; he can do every thing, every thing that is in his thought to do; we may take freſh comfort from it. Can no thought be with-holden from God? what a comfort is this to all that he hath good thoughts of, or thoughts for good. The heart of God is full of good thoughts to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, though he many times ſpeaks hard words to them, and doth hard things againſt them, yet he hath good thoughts concerning them (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.5.) <hi>Many, O Lord, my God, are thy wonderful works which thou haſt done, and thy thoughts which thou hast to us<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward:</hi> Thoughts to us-ward are thoughts for us, that is, thoughts of good intended us. Now hath the Lord many good thoughts for us, and none of theſe ſhall be with-holden; is not this comfort? When the Church of the Jews was in <hi>Babilon,</hi> the Lord dealt very hardly with them, though not ſo hardly as they deſerved. But what were his thoughts (<hi>Jer.</hi> 29.11.) <hi>I know the thoughts that I think towards you</hi> (you do not know the thoughts that I have towards you, but I do: what are they?) <hi>thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end,</hi> that is, the end which you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect and wait for. What a mercy is this, that no thought of God can be with-holden, whenas he hath ſo many thoughts of mercy and good things to his people!</p>
                  <p>Again, I might ſhew how dreadful this is to wicked men, for the Lord hath nothing but thoughts of revenge and evil towards them: But 'tis enough to hint it.</p>
                  <p>Before I paſs from this interpretation, ſome may object. If all the thoughts of God ſhall be brought to paſs, and none can with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold them, if God will do what he hath a purpoſe to do; then what need we trouble our ſelves ſo much in prayer? For if God hath any thoughts of good to us, it ſhall be done; but if not, we cannot bring it to paſs by prayer: And ſo ſome urge, what need we repent and humble our ſelves, the thoughts of God ſhall be fulfilled. To this, I ſay, in general, take heed of ſuch reaſonings; for as they are very abſurd and reaſonleſs, ſo they are very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and leave us remedileſs. More particularly,</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, thus; Though God hath thoughts and purpoſes of good to his people, yet whatſoever good he will do for his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he will be ſought unto to do it for them; and therefore prayer, repentance, and humiliation, are needful to bring forth thoughts of good from God to us. And though not man can hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="803" facs="tcp:48669:414"/> the bringing to paſs of any of his thoughts, yet we may help their birth and bringing forth. So much of the firſt interpretation of theſe words.</p>
                  <q>And that no thought can be with-holden from thee.</q>
                  <p>Secondly, no thought, that is, no thought of man can be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden from thee; thou knoweſt the thoughts of every one, what they are, of what kind they are. The Latine tranſlation is expreſs, <hi>There is no thought ſecret to thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some read the whole verſe thus. <hi>Thou knowest that thou canſt do thing every, and no thought is hidden to thee.</hi> As if <hi>Job</hi> had ſaid, <hi>O Lord, as none know what thy power is better than thy ſelf, or as none know like thy ſelf what thou canſt do, even that thou canſt do all things, ſo none know better than thy ſelf, not I my ſelf, what my thought, or opinion, or faith rather is, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning thy power and ſelf-ſufficiency to do all things.</hi> Which manner of ſpeech importeth the deep ſubmiſſion of himſelf unto God, or a kind of demiſſion, or letting of himſelf down into God, while he ſaith nothing expreſsly of himſelf, or what his thoughts were of Gods power; but refers all to God, as knowing him and his mind fully, and ſubjects himſelf wholly to his teſtimony. So that he ſeems to call God to witneſs, or appeals to God as a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſincerity of his heart, in the acknowledgment which he made of his All-ſufficiency, as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> of his love to Chriſt, when ſo often preſſed him, even a third time, with that ſearching queſtion, <hi>Simon, ſon of</hi> Jonas, <hi>loveſt thou me? Lord, thou knowest all things, thou knoweſt that I love thee</hi> (John 21.17.) <hi>Peter</hi> would not be confident, that he loved Chriſt more then thoſe; but referred himſelf, in that matter, to the judgment of Chriſt, who knew all things, and himſelf, both as to the truth and degree of his affections to him perfectly. Thus ſaid <hi>Job,</hi> thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt (and I acknowledge) that no thought can be with-holden from thee; therefore not mine.</p>
                  <p>Hence, note;
<q>Our very thoughts are plain to God; neither is there any way of concealing our thoughts from him.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>We cannot put our thoughts into a ſecret place where God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee them; we cannot with-hold them from God, as we eaſily may from man, if we can but hold our tongues, and not let our thoughts drop out of our mouths in words. (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.2.) The
<pb n="804" facs="tcp:48669:415"/> Lord knoweth <hi>our thoughts afar off.</hi> He knew what thoughts there were in the hearts of the <hi>Jews (Jer.</hi> 4.14.) <hi>O</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>waſh thine heart from wickedneſs, that thou maiſt be ſaved: how long ſhall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee!</hi> Theſe vain thoughts, were thoughts about their continuance in that peaceable condition, that the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſhould never come to moleſt them, or they ſhould never come into the hand of the enemy; as others afterwards had vain thoughts, that they ſhould be ſpeedily delivered out of their hands. Firſt, They had vain thoughts, that they ſhould never go into captivity. And Secondly, They had as vain thoughts, that they ſhould be preſently delivered out of captivity: Theſe are your vain thoughts, and theſe I know, ſaith God. Our thoughts are as open to God, as our works; all our thoughts, good and bad, are alike known to God: He knoweth our good thoughts, and the thoughts which we have to do good. If we have a thought of good to any man, the Lord knoweth it; and if we have a thought for evil to any man, the Lord knoweth it. The Lord knoweth not only what thoughts are evil in their own nature, but what are detrimentally evil unto others. Thus ſpake diſtreſſed <hi>Jeremy,</hi> in the perſon of the whole <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church (<hi>Lament.</hi> 3.60, 61, 62.) <hi>Thou haſt ſeen all their vengeance, and all their imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt me. Thou haſt heard their reproach, O Lord, and all their imaginations againſt me, and their devices againſt me all the day long.</hi> The Lord knoweth all the good thoughts that others have for us, and all the evil thoughts which they have againſt us: Now,</p>
                  <p>If no thought of ours can be with-holden from God, then keep guard, and watch over your thoughts; hold your thoughts in good order, for you cannot with-hold your diſorderly thoughts from God; bring every thought into captivity to the obedience of Chriſt (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.5.)</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If the Lord knoweth all our thoughts? then certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all good thoughts ſhall be rewarded, as well as good words, yea, even as well as good deeds. As the Lord will not loſe a good thought (which was ſhewed in the former point) ſo we ſhall not loſe a good thought; God will reward them fully, for he knoweth them fully. There was a good thought in <hi>Davids</hi> heart, to build the Lord a temple, and the Lord ſaid (as <hi>Solomon</hi> his Son reports it, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.18.) <hi>Whereas it was in thy heart to build a houſe to my name, thou didſt well that it was in thine heart,</hi> I take it as
<pb n="805" facs="tcp:48669:415"/> well, as if thou hadſt done it. God takes notice of our thoughts. And therefore this is comfort when we can do but little, yet God knows what we would do, what work our thoughts are at; and our thoughts are our beſt and choiceſt works, they are the <hi>firſt-born of the ſoul.</hi> Wicked men may do works, and ſpeak words, good for the matter, but they cannot properly think good thoughts.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if the Lord knoweth our thoughts, then evil thoughts ſhall not go unpuniſhed. When the Lord brought the deluge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the old world, we find him ſpeaking thus (<hi>Gen.</hi> 6.5.) <hi>God ſaw that the wickedneſs of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually.</hi> God ſpake not of their works, but of the imagination of their hearts, their thoughts. The Apoſtle counſel'd <hi>Simon Magus</hi> to repent of his wickedneſs, and pray God,<note place="margin">
                        <p>Recognoſcit ſo interius fuiſſe aliquo cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione ſuperba pulſatum, quod Deum non la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuiſſe cognoſcit. <hi>Aquin.</hi>

                     <hi>if perhaps the thought of his heart might be forgiven him (Acts</hi> 8.22.) There lieth the danger; take heed of evil thoughts: we are in as much danger by them, as by the worſt evil actions. Take heed, Firſt, of proud thoughts; though <hi>pride bloſſom not,</hi> that is, though it appear not openly, nor hang out its flag in words and works, yet take heed of it. Secondly, take heed of wanton and adulterous thoughts, though you act not wantonly, nor commit adultery. Thirdly, take heed of covetous thoughts, though you proceed not to covetous practices. Fourthly, of envious thoughts, or of being troubled at the good of your neighbours, though you hinder not his good. Fifthly, take heed of revengeful thoughts, or of deviſing evil a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt your neighbour, though you hurt him not, nor bring evil upon him. Sixthly, take heed of hard thoughts of God, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever his dealings be with you. Though you murmur not, though you ſpeak not hard words of his dealing with you, yet if you think hardly of him, and queſtion his juſtice or goodneſs in your hearts, he takes notice of it. Seventhly, take heed of diſcontentful thoughts with your own condition, though ſad and bitter. This was <hi>Jobs</hi> ſin, and it is conceived that he ſpake thus, as acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging that he lay open before God, as knowing all his thoughts of diſcontent. Eighthly, above all, take heed of blaſphemous thoughts of God, which the devil hoped to bring <hi>Job</hi> too. Take heed of theſe and of every every evil thought, though not acted, knowing alſo, that every evil act hath its evil thought belonging
<pb n="806" facs="tcp:48669:416"/> to it, and that no thought can be with-holden from God.</p>
                  <p>Thus much for the firſt part of <hi>Jobs</hi> humiliation, his exalting of God in his omnipotency, and in his omniſciency; he is omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent, he can do every thing, nor can any of his thoughts be with-holden from him, by any power of man; he is omniſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, no man can with-hold or hide his own thoughts from God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Job</hi> having made that great acknowledgement of the power and knowledge of God, <hi>I know thou canſt do every thing, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can any thought be with-holden from thee,</hi> comes to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of his own weakneſs and ignorance.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>
                        <bibl>
                           <hi>Verſ. 3.</hi>
                        </bibl> Who is he that hideth counſel without knowledge? there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have I uttered that I underſtood not.</p>
                     <p>Who is he?</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>That is, what manner of man is he? or what is he for a man? what a man hath he been?</p>
                  <q>That hideth counſel.</q>
                  <p>We had theſe words at the ſecond verſe of the 38th Chapter, where the Lord ſaid chidingly to <hi>Job, Who is this that darkneth counſel by words without knowledge?</hi> Here <hi>Job</hi> ſaith humbly to God, <hi>Who is this that hideth counſel?</hi> There is ſome change in the words; little, if any, in the ſenſe. There the Lord ſaid, <hi>Who is he that darkneth?</hi> Here <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>Who is he that hideth?</hi> &amp;c. both may be taken as intending the ſame thing, darkning and hiding being of a like ſignification, and things in the dark can no more be ſeen, than things hidden. Yet ſome <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Writers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that <hi>Job</hi> here doth ſomewhat abate what the Lord ſpake, or did extenuate the matter, as to his own faultineſs and miſcarriage; As if he indeed granted, that he had hid or concealed the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of God, but would be excuſed in this, that he had darkned it. This is a nice difference, and I doubt not but the ſpirit of <hi>Job</hi> was ſo low and graciouſly humbled, that he ſpake with the moſt and higheſt fervency, to humble himſelf, when he ſaid, <hi>Who is he that hideth counſel?</hi> But how had <hi>Job</hi> hid the counſel of God?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, Firſt; He had hid the counſel of God by not decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it ſo much or ſo fully as he ought, <hi>David</hi> prophecying of
<pb n="807" facs="tcp:48669:416"/> Chriſt, ſaith (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.10.) <hi>I have not hid thy righteouſneſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in my heart, I have declared thy faithfulneſs and thy ſalvation.</hi> What is meant by <hi>not hiding,</hi> in the former part of the verſe, is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by <hi>declaring,</hi> in the latter part of it; and when he ſaith, <hi>I have declared,</hi> his meaning is, I have amply and clearly made known thy faithfulneſs. So that, becauſe <hi>Job</hi> had not ſo clearly as he ſhould declared the righteouſneſs, or the righteous counſels of God concerning him, and his dealings with him, he may be ſaid to have hid the counſel of God. While we do not magnifie God, we leſſen him; while we do not declare, to the utmoſt, his power, we hide it; and therefore <hi>Job</hi> thus chargeth himſelf, <hi>Who is he that hideth?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Or we may take it thus, more diſtinctly; <hi>Job</hi> hid the counſel of God,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, by being ſo much in ſetting forth his own innocency. How much he inſiſted upon that argument, hath been ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from other places of this book. While we ſet forth our ſelves, we obſcure God. <hi>Job</hi> ſhould have been leſs in his own commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and more in the praiſes of God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Job</hi> may be ſaid to have hid the counſel of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was ſo much in amplifying and aggravating his own ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, not well conſidering the counſel of God in laying thoſe ſufferings upon him: Had he duly weighed the counſel of God in afflicting him, he would have proceeded as he began (<hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 21.) to bleſs God, both in and for his affliction.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, He may be ſaid to have hid the counſel of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he expoſtulated with God, as ſevere towards him in his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions; as if Gods counſel had been only to put him to pain. Such complainings of the living man, <hi>Jeremiah</hi> chockt, while he ſaid of God (<hi>Lam.</hi> 3.33.) <hi>He doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men.</hi> As it is not in the heart or counſel of God to afflict men with his heart (as the words there imports) ſo not to break their hearts (unleſs with godly ſorrow for their ſin) by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction. Therefore <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaking ſo much of Gods ſeverity, hid the counſel of God, which was only to try his graces and his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and graciouſly to do him good in the latter end. <hi>Who is this that hideth counſel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <pb n="808" facs="tcp:48669:417"/>Without knowledge? <hi>Or,</hi> for want of knowledge.</q>
                  <p>But, was <hi>Job</hi> an ignorant man? was he without knowledge? No, but he had not a right knowledge of the counſel of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning himſelf; which though it was ſome excuſe to him, yet it did not altogether excuſe, nor acquit him from the fault. <hi>Who is he that hideth counſel without knowledge?</hi> I ſhall not ſtay upon obſervations from this verſe, becauſe I did it at the ſecond verſe of the 38th Chapter. I ſhall only conſider that difference among Interpreters about this word <hi>counſel,</hi> to whom it doth refer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Quis eſt enim qui celat à te conſilium? <hi>Sept.</hi>
                     </note>Firſt, ſome refer it to <hi>Job,</hi> and conceive that he chargeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with this error, that he had hid his own counſel from God, or that he thought his counſel was hidden from him. The Septua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gint render it plainly to this ſenſe, <hi>Who is he that hideth counſel from thee?</hi> No man can hide the counſels, nor the moſt ſecret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendments of his ſoul from God; all things, even the thoughts of the heart, are naked and manifeſt before his eyes, with whom we have to do. 'Tis beſt for us to reveal our ſelves to him, from whom we cannot with all our skill and cunning conceal our ſelves, as was further ſhewed from the latter interpretation of thoſe words in the former verſe, <hi>No thought can be with-holden from thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But we may fully diſcharge <hi>Job</hi> of this, for he often profeſſed that his moſt ſecret wayes were known to God, yea, that the way of his and every mans heart, was known to God (<hi>Chap.</hi> 10.19.) <hi>If I ſin, then thou markeſt me.</hi> Read alſo <hi>Chap.</hi> 16.19. <hi>Chap.</hi> 31. <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. And if we look back to the 5th verſe of the firſt Chapter, there 'tis reported of <hi>Job,</hi> that he offered ſacrifice for his children after their feaſtings; for (ſaith he) <hi>it may be that my ſons have ſinned, and curſed God in their hearts.</hi> He knew, if it were but a ſin in their hearts, God took notice of it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doubtleſs he had the ſame apprehenſion of his own heart-ſins.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, others who take it for <hi>Jobs own counſel,</hi> give this ſenſe; <hi>Who is he that hideth counſel without knowledge?</hi> As if he had ſaid, <hi>I am the man that have hid my counſel, or my own mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for want of due knowledge how to expreſs it.</hi> Many hide the truth of their own apprehenſions and opinions, in the darkneſs or confuſedneſs of their expreſſions. Some have a clear notion of
<pb n="809" facs="tcp:48669:417"/> things in their head, yet cannot bring it out, and ſo hide coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel for want of knowledge to make it known. This interpretation carrieth a fair ſenſe for <hi>Jobs</hi> excuſe, acquitting him of any wilful or purpoſed ſpeaking amiſs: he had better things in his mind than he ſometimes uttered, or he wanted skill rightly to utter his own mind, and ſo darkned counſel without, or for want of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
                  <p>But I rather adhere to thoſe, who take counſel here, for the counſel or purpoſe of God in afflicting <hi>Job</hi> ſo grievouſly, and leaving him entangled in the bryars of thoſe troubleſom and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate diſputes with his friends, who came to comfort him.</p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaking in the third perſon, intends himſelf (which manner of ſpeaking is frequent in Scripture) <hi>Who is he?</hi> &amp;c. that is, <hi>I am he that have hid counſel without knowledge.</hi> For doubtleſs <hi>Job</hi> did well attend thoſe words of God in the 38th Chapter (<hi>verſ.</hi> 2.) <hi>Who is this that darkneth counſel by words without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legde?</hi> And being ſtruck with them, confeſſeth here, that God had met with him in thoſe words. And hence read theſe words of <hi>Job</hi> with an additional preface, as if they were a repetition of Gods words, <hi>Thou haſt ſaid, who is he that hideth counſel without knowledge?</hi> That is, thou haſt ſaid, that ſome body hideth coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel without knowledge, and I acknowledge 'tis I, <hi>I am he;</hi> and ſo he falls down convinced before the Lord, as <hi>David</hi> before <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,</hi> telling him in the name of the Lord, <hi>Thou art the man.</hi>

                  <p>Some underſtand this his hiding, to be only his forbearing to ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and celebrate the praiſe of God in his counſel, or the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of Gods providence towards him. But I conceive the fault which he confeſſeth here, is not a bare reticency, or his not ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the counſel of God, but his not ſpeaking rightly, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comingly, of his counſel; which agrees fully with what followeth, where <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks in the firſt perſon, or in his own perſon, and takes the charge home to, and upon himſelf.</p>

                  <p>The Hebrew word rendred <hi>underſtood,</hi> imports a diſtinct know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of things (<hi>Prov.</hi> 14.8.) <hi>The wiſdom of the prudent, is to underſtand his way;</hi> that is, to know what to do, and how or in what manner to do every duty in all the changes of his life.

At beſt he might well acknowledge he had raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>uttered things that he did not fully underſtand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Job,</hi> who thought he had ſpoken wiſely enough, while man ſpake to him, and he ſpake to men, now hearing God ſpeak, and he ſpeaking to God, doth more wiſely confeſs that himſelf was not wiſe, and that his light was but darkneſs concerning the works of God, much more concerning his counſel in thoſe works. As if he had ſaid, <hi>I have ſpoken many things of God, and of his excellencies in this diſpute with my friends; yet I have hidden, or not hit, but ſlipt that which I ſhould have moſt inſiſted upon and ſtudied to make manifeſt, even the ſoveraignty of God over me, and all that I am or have; as alſo, the counſel, aim and intention of God in laying his hand ſo ſorely upon me: but now being better informed about the reaſon of Gods dealings with me, I confeſs I have uttered that I underſtood not,</hi>
                     <q>Things too wonderful for me, which I knew not.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Job</hi> was a man of great underſtanding; yet here were things too
<pb n="811" facs="tcp:48669:418"/> wonderful for him. What were they? The counſel of God, the nature of God: theſe are paſt finding out. There are wonders in God which man cannot apprehend, much leſs comprehend. <hi>Job</hi> ſpake of things far above his reach, even of <hi>wonderful things;</hi> and therefore no wonder if he ſpake unduly of them. <hi>I</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>have uttered things too wonderful for me, which I knew not. Job</hi> here confeſſeth, that he wanted knowledge; and we know (though he were a mirror of patience) that many impatient ſpeeches paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from him. Now, here we have the root of all that impatience which this good man ſhewed in his afflictions; he had not a clear knowledge about the counſel or meaning of God in afflicting him.</p>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>Impatience flows from ignorance.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Did we underſtand theſe two things; Firſt, our own ſinfulneſs; Secondly, the ſoveraignty of God; we ſhould never be impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient. Did we underſtand our own ſinfulneſs, that we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved greater evils than any the Lord hath laid upon us; and did we underſtand the Lords ſoveraignty, that he may lay upon us what ſufferings he pleaſeth, though we had not ſinned (for we are wholly his, and he may do with his own what he will) did we (I ſay) underſtand and meditate upon theſe two things, it would quiet our minds in the greateſt ſtorms of adverſity, and be a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervative againſt all impatience. But if with theſe two, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider a third thing; that the end which the Lord hath in bringing ſufferings upon his people, is to do them good, how unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a thing will impatience appear? ſhall we be impatient at our profit! If we are well inſtructed in this great truth, that <hi>all things work together for good to them that love God, and are the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led according to his purpoſe (Rom.</hi> 8.28.) Where is there any room for impatience, in thoſe who are effectually called, and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly love God! <hi>Impatience floweth from ignorance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, in that <hi>Job</hi> confeſſeth himſelf to be the man that hid the counſels of God, when he had only been ſpeaking unadviſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of them,</p>
                  <pb n="812" facs="tcp:48669:419"/>
                  <p>Note;
<q>He that ſpeaketh improperly and unskilfully of the counſel or things of God, hideth them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>When in diſcourſes about divine truths, we do not advance the honour of God, we, as it were, caſt a vail upon it. <hi>Not to do what we ought, is to do what we ought not; our omiſſions of good, may be cenſured as commiſſions of evil.</hi> We ſhould diſplay and magnifie the wiſdom of God in all his dealings with us, and diſpenſations towards us, elſe we do unwiſely.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Job</hi> chargeth it upon himſelf as a fault, that he utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what he knew not.</p>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>Our words and our underſtandings ſhould go both together.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let us take heed of venting with our tongues, what we have not in ſome good degree reached with our underſtandings. The underſtanding ſhould give light to the tongue; nor need we any other light to ſpeak by, but that of the underſtanding. True light cannot ſhine out of our mouths, if there be much darkneſs in our minds. How ſhall we utter knowledge, if we have it not? (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.7.) <hi>God is the King in all the earth: ſing ye praiſes with underſtanding.</hi> In ſinging praiſes, as there is an exerciſe of our affections, ſo there ſhould be of our underſtanding alſo. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle puts it twice in thoſe duties of prayer and praiſe (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.15.) <hi>I will pray with the Spirit, and will pray with under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding alſo; I will ſing with the Spirit, and I will ſing with the underſtanding alſo.</hi> A word ſhould not go out of our mouths, but ſuch as the underſtanding dictates and directs: better not to ſpeak, than ſpeak what we know not. If we underſtand not what we ſpeak, we ſeldom edifie others, never our ſelves. As the tongues of ſome utter things above their experiences and affections, ſo do the tongues of others utter words beyond their judgements.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, When <hi>Job</hi> ſpake, he thought he had ſpoken very well, yet now he is convinced of his weakneſs and miſtakes in what he ſpake.</p>
                  <pb n="813" facs="tcp:48669:419"/>
                  <p>Hence note,
<q>Good-meaning men may ſometimes arrogate, and pretend to more knowledg, than cometh to their ſhare.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>They may think they know the truth in a better manner and meaſure than indeed they do: Our opinion of our ſelves is often greater than our knowledg of other matters; and we may ſoon imagine we know that, which indeed we know not. The Apoſtle ſaith (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.2.) <hi>If any man think that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know.</hi> He that really know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth any thing, as he ought, cannot but have thoughts that he knoweth it; but he that thinketh, that is, is much, or proudly think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he knoweth any thing, doth only think ſo, for he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>nothing as he ought,</hi> that is, really, groundedly, and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Obſerve;
<q>God will bring his ſervants at laſt to ſee how ſhort they are of that knowledg, which they ſometimes preſume to have.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Job</hi> thought he had more knowledg than he indeed had, and God made him ſee it. 'Tis a work of great goodneſs in God, to ſhew us how defective we are both in knowledge and goodneſs. We are full of ſelf, till God convinceth us of our ſelf-emptineſs; we are full of ſelf-wiſdom, and ſelf-ſtrength, and ſelf-righteouſneſs, till the Lord convinceth us, that our wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is folly, our ſtrength weakneſs, our righteouſneſs an unclean thing, and ſheweth us, yea cauſeth us to recieve and take Chriſt for our righteouſneſs, ſtrength, and wiſdom. God did not leave <hi>Job</hi> till he had brought him out of, and off from himſelf, as to whatſoever he had too high an opinion of, or any confidence in himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Again, <hi>Job</hi> was upon his humiliation before God; he had not any groſs ſin to charge himſelf with (for he ſtood ſtill upon his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, as he had done before; nor was <hi>Job</hi> miſtaken in that point, he had not lived in any groſs ſin) That which he charged himſelf with, was want of knowledg, and his erro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, in managing his cauſe towards God ariſing from it.</p>
                  <pb n="814" facs="tcp:48669:420"/>
                  <p>Hence note,
<q>
                        <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Our ignorance and errors, are to be confeſſed and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed before the Lord, and we to be deeply humbled for them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>What though we have not any open wickedneſs to charge our ſelves with? what though the world cannot charge us, nor we our ſelves, with any foul and black-fac'd enormities; yet have we not errors, have we not ignorances, have we not weakneſſes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs? <hi>Jobs</hi> eye had none of thoſe beams in it; but he began to ſee the moates in his eye, and repented of his ſhortneſs in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, and of his raſhneſs in language. Though great ſins call loudeſt for repentance, yet the leaſt ſin, even a ſin of ignorance, calleth us to repentance alſo; and wo to thoſe who knowingly neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, or ſtop their ears againſt that call. When <hi>David</hi> was only ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger'd at the providence of God giving proſperity to the wicked, &amp; ſo ſpake unadviſedly with his lips (as <hi>Job</hi> in a parallel caſe did) <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.13, 14.) <hi>Verily, I have cleanſed my heart in vain, and waſhed my hands in innocency: For all the day long have I been plagued and chaſtened every morning.</hi> Yet as ſoon as he recovered out of this temptation, how deeply did he charge himſelf (<hi>ver.</hi> 22.) <hi>So fooliſh was I, and ignorant; I was as a beaſt before thee.</hi> Why did he then call himſelf a fool, a beaſt? was it for adultery and murder, which were once his ſins? no, but for ignorance and raſhneſs. <hi>David</hi> called himſelf a beaſt, in judging of the dealings of God by ſenſe, not for living in any beaſtly ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality. Let us remember, and not lightly paſs it over, that though we have not (which rarely we have not) groſs ſins to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, yet we have ignorances and errors too too many. The ſame <hi>David</hi> ſaid and prayed (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.12.) <hi>Who can underſtand his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors? cleanſe thou me from ſecret faults,</hi> that is, from thoſe faults and errors which I do not underſtand; yea, cleanſe me from this fault, that I have not a better underſtanding. As he there pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be kept from the dominion (and ſo from the guilt) of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous ſins, that is, of ſins committed againſt the light of knowledg, ſo to be cleanſed from the guilt of his ſecret ſins, that is, of ſins committed without his knowledg. Thus a godly man acknowledgeth his weakneſſes, and lies low before God, in ſenſe of them, when he hath not great and groſs ſins to be humbled for.</p>
                  <pb n="815" facs="tcp:48669:420"/>
                  <p>Seventhly, As <hi>Job</hi> was now diſcovering his former ignorance; ſo, upon an increaſe of knowledge, he was growing up into a clearer light about the things of God, than he had manifeſted in his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer diſcourſes.</p>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>It is a good degree of knowledg and underſtanding, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that we know and underſtand little.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to be conſcious of our weakneſs, is a great part of our ſtrength; ſo, to be ſenſible of our ignorance is a good degree of knowledg. <hi>Agur</hi> ſaid of himſelf (<hi>Prov.</hi> 30.2.) <hi>Surely I am more brutiſh than any man, and have not the underſtanding of a man; I neither learned wiſdom, nor have the knowledg of the holy.</hi> This good man was none of the ignorant ones, he had knowledg in a large meaſure, and was growing into a further light, while he thus bewailed his own darkneſs. <hi>Davids</hi> knowledg was then cleareſt, when he made that confeſſion, <hi>So ignorant was I.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Eighthly, When was it that <hi>Job</hi> ſaw he knew little? It was when God was come nearer to him, when God had been dealing with him, and ſpeaking to him.</p>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>No man knoweth what a nothing he is in knowledge, and grace, and goodneſs, till the Lord is pleaſed to reveal him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to him.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is upon ſome eminent diſcovery of God to us, that we ſee we have little grace, righteouſneſs, or knowledg. While we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare our ſelves with our ſelves, or compare our ſelves with others below our ſelves, we have high thoughts of our ſelves; but when we compare our ſelves with God, who is infinitely above us, we are little, we are nothing, we are little or nothing in our own eyes; when God appears in his fulneſs to us, we appear empty to our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, From thoſe words, <hi>Things too wonderful for me, which I knew not.</hi> Theſe wonderful things being the dealings of God with him, according to the counſel of God concerning him,</p>
                  <pb n="816" facs="tcp:48669:421"/>
                  <p>Note,
<q>
                        <hi>Ninthly,</hi> The dealings of God with men are wonderful.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Not only the decrees of God from eternity, but the works of God in time, are full of wonder; nor can his works in time be otherwiſe, ſeeing they bear the expreſs image, and are the iſſue of thoſe eternal decrees. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is called <hi>wonderful, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller</hi> (Iſa. 9.6.) and he is wonderful in his counſels: As the works of God in us, ſo his works towards us are called wonderful. (<hi>Pal.</hi> 40.5.) <hi>Many, O Lord, my God, are thy wonderful works which thou haſt done, and thy thoughts which are to us-ward.</hi> The works of God (as of man too) are the birth of his thoughts, and the thoughts of God about the birth of man, have many wonders in them. <hi>David</hi> ſaid (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 139, 6.) <hi>Such knowledg is too won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful for me, it is high, I cannot attain unto it.</hi> What knowledg was it that he could not attain unto? The context tells us, it was the knowledg of Gods knowledg, concerning the formation of his body, before he was born (<hi>ver.</hi> 14, 15<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 16.) <hi>I will praiſe thee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made,</hi> &amp;c. Again, the Prophet having deſcribed the various courſes and methods which God uſeth in humbling ſinners, by afflictions and tribulations, which are ſhadowed under thoſe Metaphors and Allegorical expreſſions of Plowing and Harrowing, and the different ways of Threſhing out the Corn, by the ſtaff, or the rod, or the wheel. The Spirit of God doth not there intend the husband-mans work alone, in which yet there is much of God, and his teachings: The Prophet (I ſay) having done this, concludes (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.29.) <hi>This alſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth from the Lord of Hoſts, who is wonderful in counſel, and excellent in working.</hi> And as there are wonders in the works of God, which are the fulfilling of his ſecret and hidden counſel; ſo there are wonders in the Word of God, which is his reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and open counſel (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.18.) <hi>Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy Law.</hi> The Law is wonderful; but the Goſpel is, as it were, a continued wonder, and we ſhall be for ever wondring at, and admiring the grace and goodneſs of God diſcovered, therein when we come to heaven; and now, as we ſee further into the miſtery of Chriſt, we do it too (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.7.) <hi>We ſpeak the wiſdom of God in a miſtery, even the hidden wiſdom which God ordained before the world. Eye hath not ſeen,
<pb n="817" facs="tcp:48669:421"/> nor ear heard, neither have entred into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.</hi> They are won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful things, which man, by all his natural wiſdom, cannot attain unto. Philoſophers, who pry into all the ſecrets of nature, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not underſtand theſe ſupernatural ſecrets, how long ſoever they ſtand prying upon them: And though <hi>Job</hi> had been long conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of, and ſpeaking about thoſe things of God, which the eye often ſees, and the ear heard, yea, which he himſelf (to his grief) had felt; yet he ſaw reaſon enough at laſt to ſay, that even thoſe things, in the whole compaſs of them, exceeded his reaſon; <hi>I</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>have uttered that I underſtood not, things too wonderful for me which I knew not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Job</hi> having thus acknowledged his want of knowledg, and the weakneſs of his underſtanding in the miſteries of providence, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth himſelf to God for inſtruction in the next verſe.</p>

                     </bibl> Hear, I beſeech thee, and I will ſpeak: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.</q>
                  <p>This is <hi>Jobs</hi> humble petition; and it conſiſteth of two parts.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That God would not reject, but give ear to a poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, burdened with the ſenſe of his infirmities, in his addreſſes to him; <hi>Hear, I beſeech thee, and I will ſpeak,</hi> or as Mr. <hi>Brough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> renders, <hi>Oh, hear me, when I do ſpeak.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, That God would admit him under his tuition, and inſtruct him, while he waited for advice and counſel: <hi>I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of thee, and declare thou unto me;</hi> Lord, teach thou me. <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaketh ſubmiſſively as became a learner; he is not now what he was, he comes to God in another manner, than he had done before;
<q>Hear, I beſeech thee, and I will ſpeak.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>As if he had ſaid; I have formerly deſired to plead my cauſe with thee (<hi>Chap.</hi> 13.22.) and thou haſt juſtly checkt, and chid me for it (<hi>Chap.</hi> 38.3. <hi>Chap.</hi> 40.2.) as if I preſumed I could teach thee; but now I ſee my error, I ſubmit, and earneſtly deſire to be taught by thee. I have ſpoken heretofore otherwiſe than I ought, and otherwiſe than I purpoſe to ſpeak hereafter: I ſpake before in a challenging ſtrain (<hi>Chap.</hi> 13.22.) <hi>Then call thou, and I will anſwer: or let me ſpeak, and anſwer thou me.</hi> There <hi>Job</hi> ſeemed
<pb n="818" facs="tcp:48669:422"/> to challenge God, to be either opponent or reſpondent, and he would argue, or diſpute it out with him. But here, though his words are near the ſame in ſound, yet his ſence is far different; <hi>Hear, I beſeech thee, and I will ſpeak:</hi>
                     <q>I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is a two-fold demanding; Firſt, as a Diſputant; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, as a Supplicant. <hi>Job</hi> would now demand as a Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant unto God,<note place="margin">M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I anſwer, Firſt, <hi>Job</hi> made this ſuit to God, upon this condition, that God would pleaſe to enform him, if he ſaw need, or ſhould think fit to do it. Secondly, <hi>Job</hi> ſpake this doctrinally to ſhew what he and others ought to deſire &amp; ſubmit to, even the teachings of God. Thirdly, I anſwer, that the Lord ſeeing his ſubmiſſion, ſaw there was no need of ſpeaking any further to him, but broke up the whole diſputation, determining for <hi>Job,</hi> and giving him the day againſt his three friends, as will appear further in the ſequel of the Chapter.</p>
                  <p>From this verſe,</p>
                  <p>Obſerve,
<q>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> The ſence of our wants puts us upon prayer.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>When <hi>Job</hi> was ſenſible that he wanted underſtanding and knowledge, he came to God for it. <hi>Give me to underſtand, cauſe me to know.</hi> True and fervent prayer floweth from a ſence of our wants. If we ſee not our ſelves in need, why ſhould we pray? And when really we ſhall have no need (as in heaven) there will be no need of prayer; all will be praiſe, and all ſhall be in everlaſting praiſes.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The perſon to whom <hi>Job</hi> maketh his application for teaching, being God himſelf,</p>
                  <p>Note;
<q>We know nothing of God, nor of our ſelves aright, till God teacheth us, till he declareth and maketh it known to us.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Every good gift, and every perfect gift, is from above, and cometh down from the father of lights,</hi> &amp;c. (<hi>Jam.</hi> 1.17.) As no man can either make or redeem himſelf, ſo no man can teach or inſtruct himſelf. What we know of God, we know, from God? 'Tis in his light that we ſee light. The light may ſhine round about us, and we ſee it not; unleſs God enlighten us, as well as ſend us the light, we are never the better. As in conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the Lord firſt <hi>opens the eyes, and then turns from darkneſs to light</hi> (Acts 26.18.) So under every diſpenſation, we are in the
<pb n="820" facs="tcp:48669:423"/> dark, till God opens our eyes, and give us (by his own immediate or mediate teachings) light about it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, note;
<q>If we deſire God ſhould teach us, or if we would be taught of God, we muſt ask it of him.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>We find the godly often putting up this requeſt to God. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> was much in this petition (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.33, 34.) <hi>Teach me, O Lord, the way of thy ſtatutes, and I ſhall keep it unto the end: Give me underſtanding, and I ſhall keep thy law.</hi> He did not only deſire God that he would teach him, but give him a faculty, to receive his teachings (<hi>verſ.</hi> 35.) <hi>Make me to go in the path of thy commandement.</hi> See how the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> joyneth theſe petitions to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Firſt, <hi>Teach me the way of thy ſtatutes.</hi> Secondly, <hi>Give me underſtanding;</hi> as if he had ſaid, <hi>elſe thy teachings will do no good.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>Make me to go in the path of thy commandement;</hi> as if he had ſaid, though I underſtand thy ſtatutes, yet, unleſs thou help me, I ſhall not be able to walk in them, no, nor to take one right ſtep in them; therefore, <hi>Make me to go in the path of thy commandement.</hi> Again (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 143.10.) <hi>Teach me to do thy will, for thou art my God; thy ſpirit is good, lead me into the land of up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs.</hi> As the Lord teacheth us our way, and hath promiſed to teach us always, in all things needful for us to know and do; ſo he hath taught us by the written practiſe of many, as well as by his written precept, that we muſt pray for his teaching.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Job</hi> was humbling himſelf, and now he begs of God, that he would teach him.</p>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>Humble ſouls deſire and give up themſelves wholly to be taught by God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>They hang upon his mouth for inſtruction, and renounce their own wiſdom. <hi>Eliphaz</hi> gave <hi>Job</hi> that advice (<hi>Chap.</hi> 22.22.) <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint thy ſelf now with him, and be at peace, and good ſhall come unto thee: Receive, I pray thee, thee law from his mouth, and lay up his words in thy heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, In that <hi>Job</hi> prays for teaching in this form, according to the Hebrew, <hi>make me to know,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="821" facs="tcp:48669:423"/>
                  <p>Obſerve;
<q>The teachings of God are effectual, they make us know.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Men may teach others knowledge, but they cannot make them know. God can make a very dullard quick of underſtanding. Men may inſtruct the underſtanding, but they cannot give under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; God doth both. The teachings of God are effectual to all purpoſes. Firſt, to enlighten the ignorant. Secondly, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince gain-ſayers. Thirdly, to convert ſinners. Fourthly, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort thoſe that are ſorrowful. Fifthly, to reſolve ſuch as are doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Sixthly, to encourage the fearful. And, Seventhly, to raiſe up and recover thoſe that are fallen. Thus <hi>Job</hi> is become a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioner to the Lord for inſtruction, having confeſſed his own ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and weakneſs. And that he had formerly profited under the teachings of God, and was now in a further way of profiting, is evident by that which followeth.</p>
                  <q>
                     <bibl>
                        <hi>Verſ. 5.</hi>
                     </bibl> I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear, but now mine eye ſeeth thee.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Job</hi> had no ſooner asked for teaching, but God taught him, though not formally and explicitely as he deſired, yet really and effectually, as he needed. For, this verſe ſeems to be a real an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the petition he made in the former verſe; and in it <hi>Job</hi> aſſerts two things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>That he had heard of God by the hearing of the ear.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>That now his eye did ſee him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are two opinions about the general ſenſe of this verſe, and I ſhall conclude in a third.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Some conceive theſe diſcoveries of God to <hi>Job,</hi> were on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, inward to his ſoul; ſo that when he ſaith, <hi>I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear, but now mine eye ſeeth thee,</hi> we are not to underſtand him, as if he had had any viſible appearance of God, but that theſe words may be taken,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, as a compariſon between a ſlight hearing, when the mind is not intent upon what the ear heareth; and a ſerious hearing, which brings the mind fully into the ear. As if <hi>Job</hi> had formerly been a careleſs hearer, but now an attentive one; and ſo the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which <hi>Job</hi> had of God formerly, was little compared with his preſent knowledge. He had a knowledge of God by hearing only
<pb n="822" facs="tcp:48669:424"/> before, but his mind was not intent upon it; he heard only with the hearing of his ear, but <hi>his eye did not ſee;</hi> that is, he had not a clear ſight or knowledge, which is an intellectual ſight of the things which he heard. But doubtleſs, <hi>Job</hi> was no ſlight hearer of the word in former times; he did not hear the word in the dayes of his proſperity, as if he had only (as we ſay) given it the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: for, had he not ſeriouſly hearkned to the voice of God in thoſe dayes, he had never obtained ſuch a teſtimony as God gave of him, towards the end of thoſe dayes; yea, this very phraſe, <hi>I have heard of thee, by the hearing of the ear,</hi> implyeth ſerious and attentive hearing.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Others who deny any viſible manifeſtation of God to <hi>Job,</hi> grant that the firſt part of the verſe, notes ſerious hearing and receiving of the word, the latter more; ſo that here, ſay they, is a compariſon between that leſſer light or knowledge which <hi>Job</hi> had of the will of God before, and that fuller light which he got upon this diſcourſe which the Lord had with him; the former be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but as of a matter heard, this as of things ſeen. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſometimes calls clear knowledge ſight: So that, look how much that which we ſee with our bodily eyes, is clearer to us than that whereof we have only heard the report; by ſo much the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which <hi>Job</hi> had now of the things of God, eſpecially about the whole myſtery of Gods dealing with him, was clearer and fuller than what he had before, even as if he now ſaw what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he only heard. As we ſay, <hi>One eye-witneſs, is better than ten ear-witneſſes;</hi> ſo <hi>one eying</hi> of the word of God (the eye of the mind fully and diſtinctly taken in what is heard) is better than <hi>ten earings</hi> of it; that is, when little or nothing is taken in at the ear, but a ſound of words: For then only we may be ſaid to know divine things, by the ſeeing of the eye, when we know them not only from without by the report of others, but from experience within our ſelves. The Apoſtle ſaith of thoſe, who took joyfully the ſpoyling of their goods for the truths ſake, <hi>They knew in themſelves, that they had in heaven a better and a more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during ſubſtance (Heb.</hi> 10.34.) that is, they had even got a ſight of that heavenly enduring ſubſtance. Hence in Scripture, viſion is applied to ſpiritual things heard; and we are ſaid to ſee <hi>the Word of God</hi> (Jer. 2.31.) <hi>O generation, ſee ye the Word of the Lord; have I been a wilderneſs?</hi> &amp;c. As if the Lord had ſaid, <hi>Ye
<pb n="823" facs="tcp:48669:424"/> have heard it before, but now ſee it.</hi> Seeing notes the higheſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; then we ſee what we hear, when we fully underſtand what we have heard. Thus they expound this Text, who judge there was no outward viſion at all, but that <hi>Jobs</hi> ſeeing was only ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and intellectual.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Others affirm, that <hi>Job</hi> had an outward apparition, and that the eye of his ſenſe was affected. And concerning this,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Some are ſo much of this opinion, that they ſay Chriſt appeared in humane ſhape to <hi>Job,</hi> as he did to many of the holy Patriarks and Prophets of old; which apparitions are by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients called <hi>preludes to his incarnation.</hi> And ſome <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Writers tell us, that <hi>Job</hi> upon this ſight of God, had a ſpirit of propheſie given him; but they need not inſiſt upon that, for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral have had apparitions, who were no Prophets.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, others ſay, the appearance of God to <hi>Job</hi> was only in or by a cloud, with the whirlwind. But that he had a viſion or ſight of God one way or other, is aſſerted, as by many of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Writers, ſo by moſt of the Chriſtian Ancients.</p>
                  <p>And doubtleſs, when the Lord ſpake to him out of the whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind, he had a viſion, or an extraordinary manifeſtation of God, even to his eye: Not that God in himſelf can be ſeen, <hi>No man hath ſeen God at any time</hi> (1 <hi>John</hi> 4.12.) It is reported by the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Writers, that the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> was ſawn aſunder by his own Nation, for ſaying, that he had ſeen the Lord (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.1.) <hi>I ſaw the Lord ſitting upon a throne, high and lifted up.</hi> This they counted blaſphemy, and put him to death for it, ſay ſome: yet others ſay, he was put to death for his plainneſs in reproving the Princes and people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in thoſe words (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.10.) <hi>Hear the word of the Lord ye Rulers of</hi> Sodom, <hi>give ear to the Law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.</hi> But of that by the way. I ſay, God in himſelf cannot be ſeen; he is ſeen only by thoſe viſible demonſtrations of his preſence, which he is pleaſed to make of himſelf, as here he ſpake to <hi>Job</hi> out of the whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind.</p>
                  <p>I conceive we may take in both; ſo that when <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaketh of <hi>his hearing by the ear,</hi> he intends that teaching which he had in former times by the Miniſtry of his Anceſtors: And that, when he ſaith, <hi>But now mine eye ſeeth thee,</hi> he intends that teaching
<pb n="824" facs="tcp:48669:425"/> which he had from the preſent appearance of God to him for his inſtruction and humiliation; <hi>I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear, but now mine eye ſeeth thee.</hi> As if he had ſaid, <hi>Lord, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore I heard of thee, for I was religiouſly brought up; I had Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and Anceſtors, who declared to me who the Lord was; and I heard many things of thee, which took impreſſion upon my heart heretofore: but I never had ſuch an impreſſion as in this tempeſt, I never heard God ſpeaking thus immediately to me; nor did he ever give me any ſuch viſible demonſtration of his preſence, as he hath vouchſafed me at this time, ſpeaking out of the whirlwind.</hi> And from all we may conclude, that as <hi>Job</hi> had a powerful illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit, ſo an outward apparition of the Glory and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of God, or of Gods glorious Majeſty to convince and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble him. So that, though <hi>Job</hi> had a ſaving knowledge of God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, yet this diſcourſe of God with him, and diſcovery of God to him, had made him a better Scholar than all his earthly teachers. <hi>I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear,</hi>
                     <q>But now mine eye ſeeth thee.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>That is, now I have as clear a ſight or knowledge of thy mind and will, of thy juſtice and goodneſs, of thy power and ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty, as if I had ſeen thee with mine eyes, and had ſeen or looked into thy heart. Or thus: Not only haſt thou graciouſly inſtructed me, by ſpeaking ſo much to me, but thou haſt mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted thy ſelf preſent with me, by an aſpectable ſign, <hi>Mine eye hath ſeen thee;</hi> that is, thou haſt given me to ſee that which aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures me thou art neer unto me, namely, the Cloud, out of which thou haſt been pleaſed to ſpeak and make known thy mind to me, who am but duſt and aſhes.</p>
                  <p>The Lord may be ſeen theſe four wayes;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, In his Word. Secondly, In his works. Thirdly, In out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward apparitions. Fourthly, And above all, God is ſeen in his Son, our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, whom the Apoſtle calls (<hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3.) <hi>The brightneſs of his glory, and the expreſs image of his perſon;</hi> and in whoſe face the light of the knowledge of God ſhineth (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6.) And hence Chriſt ſaith (<hi>John</hi> 14.9.) <hi>He that hath ſeen me, hath ſeen the father.</hi> The inviſible father is ſeen in his Son, who was made viſible in our fleſh, <hi>John</hi> 1.18. Thus God may be ſeen. But in his nature God is altogether inviſible,
<pb n="825" facs="tcp:48669:425"/> he cannot be ſeen. <hi>Moſes ſaw him that is inviſible (Heb.</hi> 11.27.) that is, he ſaw him by an eye of faith, who is inviſible to the eye of ſenſe. <hi>I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear, but now mine eye ſeeth thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note, Firſt;
<q>It is a great mercy, and much to be acknowledged, that we have the word of God ſounding in our ears.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Faith cometh by hearing (Rom.</hi> 10.17.) The Prophet ſaith (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.3.) <hi>Hear, and your ſoul ſhall live.</hi> Now if faith and life come by hearing; to have the word of God ſounding in our ears, muſt needs be a great mercy. Though to have the word only ſounding in our ear, will do no man good, yet 'tis good to hear that joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſound. Though that ſad Propheſie mentioned by Chriſt (<hi>Mat.</hi> 13.14.) be fulfilled in many, <hi>By hearing ye ſhall hear, and ſhall not underſtand, and ſeeing ye ſhall ſee, and ſhall not perceive;</hi> Yet he ſaid to his faithful followers (<hi>verſ.</hi> 16.) <hi>Bleſſed are your eyes, for they ſee, and your ears, for they hear.</hi> They receive a bleſſing by hearing, whoſe ears are bleſſed when they hear. O how many ſouls are bleſſing God, that ever they heard of himſelf and his Son, our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by the hearing of the ear. To have an ear to hear, is a common bleſſing; but to have an hearing ear, or to hear by the hearing of the ear, is a ſpecial bleſſing.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve, Secondly;
<q>We ſhould hear the Word very diligently.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>That phraſe, <hi>I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear</hi> (as the Hebrew Writers note) ſignifieth a very attentive hearing. Every hearing is not an hearing with the ear, nor every ſeeing like that we intend, when a man ſaith, <hi>I ſaw it with my eyes.</hi> One may ſee and not ſee, hear and not hear. The Word of God is to be <hi>heard with a hearing.</hi> Such doublings in Scripture have a great emphaſis in them. As when the Lord ſaith, <hi>They are curſed with a curſe,</hi> it notes a great and a certain curſe is coming; ſo to hear <hi>by the hearing of the ear,</hi> implyeth fruitful hearing, and a laying up of that in the mind which hath been heard (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.1.) <hi>We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us, what work thou didſt in their dayes, in the times of old.</hi> They who thus hear with their ears, treaſure up in their hearts, and do with their
<pb n="826" facs="tcp:48669:426"/> hands what they have heard. The Lord charged <hi>Ezekiel</hi> (Chap. 44.5.) <hi>Son of man, mark well and behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears, all that I ſay unto thee;</hi> that is, mind diligently what I ſhew and ſay unto thee. The Lord called for the exerciſe of both ſenſes, in attending to what he ſpake to the Prophet: He did not only ſay, <hi>Hear with thine ears,</hi> but <hi>ſee with thine eyes;</hi> that is, hear as if thou didſt even ſee that which thou heareſt. For though poſſibly the Lord preſented ſomewhat to the eye of the Prophet, as well as he ſpake to his ear, yet the former notion may well be taken in, yea, and intended in that command. Many hear as if they had no ears, and ſee as if they had no eyes. One of the Ancients taking notice of that, ſaith, Such kind of hearers are like <hi>Malchus</hi> in the Goſpel, who had his ear cut off. From thoſe words, <hi>But now mine eye ſeeth thee,</hi> taken diſtinctly,</p>
                  <p>Obſerve, Thirdly;
<q>God revealeth himſelf more clearly and fully at one time, than at another.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Seeing is ſomewhat more than hearing, though it be atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive hearing. As the full and clear manifeſtation which we ſhall have of God in the next life, is expreſſed by ſeeing, and called viſion; ſo the fulleſt and cleareſt apprehenſion which we have of God, and the things of God in this life, is a degree of ſeeing both him and them, 'tis the ſight of faith, and may alſo be called viſion. A true and ſtrong believer taſts, and feels, and ſees the truths of the Goſpel which he hath heard; his faith (which is the eye of his ſoul) is the evidence of thoſe things to him which are not ſeen, nor can be ſeen by an eye of ſenſe: He by the help of the Holy Ghoſt looks ſtedfaſtly into heaven, and (with this eye) <hi>ſeeth the glory of God, and Jeſus ſtanding at the right hand of God</hi> (in his meaſure) as bleſſed <hi>Stephen</hi> did (<hi>Acts</hi> 7.55.) This ſight of God and ſpirituals, hath three things in it beyond that ordinary, though real knowledge, which comes in by the hearing of the ear. Firſt, a ſurpaſſing clearneſs. Secondly, an undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed certainty. Thirdly, a raviſhing ſweetneſs, and the overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of conſolation.</p>
                  <pb n="827" facs="tcp:48669:426"/>
                  <p>Fourthly, Note;
<q>According to the meaſure of Gods revealing himſelf to us, ſuch is the meaſure of our profiting in the knowledge of God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The word is ſpoken to all, in the publick Miniſtry of it, it is ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered upon all; but they only learn to know God &amp; themſelves tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to whom God doth inwardly reveal it, &amp; whoſe hearts he touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and openeth by his Spirit. <hi>Every man</hi> (ſaith Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 6.45.) <hi>That hath heard &amp; learned of the father, cometh unto me;</hi> that is, <hi>All that are taught of God,</hi> believe on me. And the more any learn of the father, the more they come to, &amp; abide the more cloſely with the Son. <hi>Job</hi> underſtood more of God, and the mind of God more, in all thoſe queſtions he put to him, concerning the heavens, the earth, the Sea, concerning the beaſts of the earth, and the fowls of the Air, concerning <hi>Behemoth</hi> and <hi>Leviathan,</hi> than ever he did before. The more immediate and extraordinary revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of God, are alwayes accompanied with notable effects: And though few profit in knowledge, according to the meaſure of the mediate and ordinary Revelation, yet probably the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation we have of that kind, the more we profit.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>Job</hi> had theſe great diſcoveries after God had kept him long in affliction.</p>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>God doth uſually reveal himſelf moſt to his people after great ſufferings.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence ſome are of opinion, that in theſe words <hi>Job</hi> pointed at his two ſtates. Firſt, that of his proſperity; then he heard of God only by the hearing of the ear. Secondly, Of his adverſity; then his eye ſaw him, that is, he greatly profited in the knowledge of him. There are two things which God uſually beſtows upon his people in the day of, or ſoon after their affliction; Firſt, more cordials and conſolations: He gives <hi>that ſtrong drink to thoſe that are ready to periſh, that wine unto thoſe that be of heavy hearts,</hi> He bids them <hi>drink and forget their poverty, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber their miſery no more;</hi> as <hi>Solomons</hi> metaphors may well im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port (<hi>Prov.</hi> 31.6, 7.) Secondly, as the Lord gives more conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in ſuch a day, ſo more illumination; the head is bettered by it as well as the heart. Many have got much inward light or
<pb n="828" facs="tcp:48669:427"/> knowledge, both of God and of themſelves, of their mercies and of their duties, by being, or after they have been brought into much outward darkneſs. <hi>Davids</hi> experience taught him this, elſe he had never ſaid (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.71.) <hi>It is good for me that I have been afflicted, that I might learn thy ſtatutes.</hi> He had never learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, either to know the Statutes of God better, or to keep them better by his affliction, if God had not been with him, and reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf further to him in the day of his affliction.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Note;
<q>When God manifeſts himſelf much to any man, great impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are left upon him.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>As will appear further in opening the next verſe.</p>

                        <hi>Verſ. 6.</hi>
                     </bibl> Wherefore I abhor my ſelf, and repent in duſt and aſhes.</q>
                  <p>This verſe concludes that part of the Chapter, which I call <hi>Jobs</hi> humiliation. He made confeſſion before of his own igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, uttering things that he underſtood not, things too won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful for him, which he knew not; he confeſſed alſo the great goodneſs of God to him, in that he had both heard of him by the hearing of the ear, and alſo that his eye had ſeen him: from all which he inferr'd this reſolve of deepeſt ſelf-abaſement before God.</p>
                  <q>Wherefore I abhor my ſelf, and repent in duſt and aſhes.</q>
                  <p>This word <hi>(wherefore)</hi> is diligently to be attended, for 'tis the hinge upon which the whole matter turneth. This <hi>wherefore,</hi> may have a double reference.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To the ſight which he had gained of his own folly, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and vileneſs, of which having made confeſſion in the former words, he adds <hi>wherefore;</hi> that is, for as much as I am thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of mine own ſinfulneſs, <hi>I abhor my ſelf, and repent in duſt and aſhes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, This <hi>wherefore,</hi> may have reference to thoſe higher, clearer and fuller manifeſtations of God to him. He had heard of God by the hearing of the ear, there was much in that; but now his eye had ſeen him, he had a light or a diſcovery of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and Majeſty of God, as much ſurpaſſing and exceeding what
<pb n="829" facs="tcp:48669:427"/> formerly he had, as eye-ſight doth the hearing of the ear: <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi> the light being come thus fully in upon him, concerning the glory, ſoveraignty, goodneſs, faithfulneſs, and all-ſufficiency of God, he cryeth out,
<q>I abhorr my ſelf, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Hebrew word ſignifieth the greateſt diſguſt againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, a kind of reprobating himſelf,<note place="margin">

Some render, wherefore, <hi>I reprehend or reprove my ſelf:</hi> but to abhor our ſelves is more than to reprehend or reprove our ſelves. Others, <hi>I reject, I deſpiſe, I ſlight my ſelf, I turn away from my ſelf.</hi> All theſe renderings ſhew to how little or low an account <hi>Job</hi> was now come in his own ſight: Our read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>I abhor,</hi> takes in all the reſt and more. The Lord uſeth this word negatively concerning his people (<hi>Levit.</hi> 26.11.) <hi>I will ſet my tabernacle amongſt you, and my ſoul ſhall not abhor you;</hi> the meaning is, my ſoul ſhall greatly delight in you: And at the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe of the ſame chapter, affirmatively of them, <hi>If you ſhall deſpiſe my ſtatutes, or if your ſoul abhor my judgments, then, &amp;c.</hi> deſpiſing is leſs than abhorring. To abhor the judgments of God, is to caſt them not only out of our affections, but out of our judgment too, and to judge them unworthy or unfit to be owned and obeyed. Again, at the 30<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe of ſame chapter, <hi>I will deſtroy your high places, and cut down your images, and caſt your carcaſſes upon the carcaſſes of your idols, and my ſoul ſhall abhor you;</hi> that is, I will manifeſt the utmoſt and higheſt of my diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure againſt you. Once more in the ſame chapter, <hi>When they be in the land of their enemies, I will not caſt them away, neither will I abhor them.</hi> To abhor is to caſt away, and to look upon a perſon or a people as <hi>caſt-aways.</hi> Read alſo (<hi>Deut.</hi> 7.26. <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.7. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 129.163. <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.24. <hi>Jerem.</hi> 14.21. <hi>Amos</hi> 5.10. <hi>chap.</hi> 6.8. <hi>Zech.</hi> 11.8.) from all which texts we may collect the weight and great ſignificancy of this word. To <hi>abhor</hi> things or perſons, imports the deepeſt diſplicency or diſlike towards either. <hi>I</hi> (ſaith <hi>Job) abhor</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The word <hi>(my ſelf)</hi> is here ſupplyed by our tranſlators. The
<pb n="830" facs="tcp:48669:428"/> Hebrew is only this, <hi>wherefore I abhor,</hi> leaving us to ſuppoſe what he did abhor: Our tranſlators make the ſuppliment thus, <hi>I abhor my ſelf,</hi> that is, whatſoever may be called <hi>my ſelf,</hi> ſelf-wiſdom, ſelf-righteouſneſs, ſelf-ſtrength, ſelf-ends, and I would ſee the end of ſinful-ſelf.

                  <p>Firſt, I abhor, that ever I curſed the day of my birth.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I abhor, that I wiſhed ſo often for death, that I wooed the grave, and ſo ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Fourthly, I abhor, that I uſed ſo many complaints of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Lords dealings with me.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, I abhor, that I was ſo bold, as to deſire to plead with God.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, I abhor, that I was ſo much in ſetting out my own righteouſneſs and innocency.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, I abhor, that ever I ſpake any word, which ſhould in the leaſt darken or reflect upon the goodneſs, mercy, faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, righteouſneſs, and ſoveraignity of God in his diſpenſations towards me. Theſe are the things which had unwarily paſſed him in the heat of diſputation with his friends, and theſe he now abhorreth. Take it either way, <hi>I abhor my ſelf,</hi> or <hi>theſe things,</hi> it comes all to one; for the truth is, he did abhor himſelf for thoſe things, which he had ſpoken with ſo much imprudence and impatience, while he was under the hand of God. <hi>I abhor my ſelf</hi> (neither is that all)
<q>And repent.</q>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Job</hi> was not only affected to abhorrence, but to repentance. The word tranſlated <hi>repent,</hi>

                  <pb n="831" facs="tcp:48669:428"/>
                  <p>Secondly, To comfort or to take comfort; thus it is rendered (<hi>Gen.</hi> 24.67.) <hi>Iſaac was comforted concerning the death of his mother</hi> (2 Sam. 13.39.) <hi>David was comforted concerning Amnon.</hi> (Pſal. 77.2.) <hi>In the day of my trouble I ſought the Lord, my ſore ran in the night and ceaſed not; my ſoul refuſed to be comforted.</hi> It may ſeem ſtrange, that the ſame word which ſignifies ſorrow and repentance, ſhould ſignifie alſo comfort and to be comforted: but ſorrow and comfort meet in true repentance; godly ſorrow doth not hinder, much leſs quite exclude, and ſhut out joy in God. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is uſhered in by godly ſorrow, and grief of heart for ſin, and it concludes with comfort and joy of heart in God who pardoneth ſinners; and therefore the ſame word which ſignifies <hi>to repent,</hi> may well ſignifie both to grieve and to take comfort. Repentance is a change from a bad ſtate to a good, and a turning from the worſt of evils, <hi>ſin,</hi> to the chiefeſt good, <hi>God himſelf;</hi> and therefore muſt needs be followed, if not accompanied with much ſweetneſs and comfort.<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. Et con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolationem ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepi in pulvere &amp; cinere.</note> A Greek tranſlator renders it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly ſo in this place, <hi>Wherefore I abhor my ſelf, and take com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in duſt and aſhes;</hi> and doubtleſs, while <hi>Job</hi> was repenting in floods of ſorrow, his comforts came flowing in. There is a laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in the midſt of which the heart is ſorrowful, and the end of that mirth is heavineſs (ſaith <hi>Solom,</hi> Prov. 14.13.) and there is a ſorrow (that's a bleſſed ſorrow) in the midſt of which the heart laughs, and the end of which heavineſs is mirth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To repent</hi> (in the general nature of it) <hi>is to change both the mind and way,</hi> and ſo take up new principles and new practices. A man that truly repenteth, is not the ſame man he was before he repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; he can ſay, <hi>I am not I.</hi> And as in true repentance there is a change from a bad to a good mind, and from a perverſe, to a right and righteous way; ſo in repentance, there is a change from a troubled to a quiet mind, and from a painful to a pleaſant and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful way. So then, there is a two-fold change in repentance; Firſt, A change of the mind from ſin. Secondly, A change in the mind from ſorrow. Many are the griefs and gripes, the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and perplexities, with which the conſcience of an awakened ſinner is followeth, till he hath unburdened himſelf by confeſſion and repentance; when once he hath truly done ſo, how great is his peace! &amp; how ſweet are his conſolations! And therefore, when the Apoſtle ſaith (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.10.) <hi>Godly ſorrow worketh repentance to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
<pb n="832" facs="tcp:48669:429"/> not to be repented of;</hi> his meaning is, the repentance which it works is matter of great rejoycing, or fills the ſoul of an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled believing ſinner with great joy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I abhor my ſelf</hi> (ſaith <hi>Job) and repent.</hi> But how did <hi>Job</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent? his was no ordinary repentance, therefore, he adds, <hi>I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,</hi>
                     <q>In duſt and aſhes.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>That is, either;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Throwing my ſelf upon the ground, (<hi>Jer.</hi> 6.26. <hi>Jer.</hi> 25.34. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.16.) or,</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Sitting upon the ground in the duſt, as (<hi>Job</hi> 2.8. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.5. <hi>Jonah</hi> 3.6.) or,</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Caſting duſt upon my head (<hi>Job</hi> 2.12.) Duſt caſt upon the head was the embleme of an afflicted heart. And to ſit in the duſt, or to caſt duſt upon the head was anciently the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial part of repentance. <hi>Job</hi> doth not leave that out, <hi>I repent</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in duſt and aſhes;</hi>

                  <p>There is another rendring of this latter part of the verſe, thus, <hi>I repent, as looking upon, or accounting my ſelf duſt and aſhes;</hi> 'tis an argument of much humility and humiliation to do ſo. <hi>Abraham</hi> gave himſelf no higher a title before the Lord (<hi>Gen.</hi> 18.27.) <hi>I have begun to ſpeak, who am but duſt and aſhes.</hi> If we take it thus, <hi>I abhor my ſelf, and repent, looking upon my ſelf but as duſt and aſhes,</hi> it is a good ſence alſo, and reacheth the purpoſe which <hi>Job</hi> was upon, or which was upon <hi>Jobs</hi> ſpirit in that day and duty of repentance. There is no difficulty in the words, they yield many uſeful obſervations: <hi>Wherefore I abhor my ſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, As the word <hi>wherefore</hi> refers to that ſignal diſcovery which <hi>Job</hi> had of God, who did not only manifeſt himſelf to him by the hearing of the ear, but by the ſeeing of the eye, that is more fully than before;</p>

The true reaſon why men carry it ſo high at any time with God, is, becauſe their notions and apprehenſions of God, fall ſo infinitely below him.

<pb n="834" facs="tcp:48669:430"/> they may boaſt of their knowledge; but as the Apoſtle ſaith (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.2.) <hi>He that thinketh he knoweth any thing knoweth nothing as he ought.</hi> The Scripture tells us, what that knowledge is which a carnal man hath of God: He knows God in his own light, not in the light of God; or he judgeth what God is, by what him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.21.) <hi>Thou thoughteſt that I was altogether ſuch a one as thy ſelf.</hi> Not that he thought God was a man; he had not ſuch groſs thoughts of God: but he thought God, as to his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, was ſuch a one as himſelf, who was indeed, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his pretentions to holineſs, a very unholy, a meer carnal man. When the Lord ſaid to him, <hi>Thou thoughteſt that I was altogether ſuch a one as thy ſelf;</hi> it is, as if he had ſaid, Thou meaſuredſt me by thy ſelf, and becauſe ſuch things pleaſed thee, thou wouldſt needs conclude that they pleaſed me too. Had men a clear knowledge of God, as he hath revealed himſelf, they would ſoon be convinced, that God is not only not altogether, but not at all ſuch a one as themſelves.

                  </p>
                  <p>Hence, Obſerve;
<q>The more we ſee and know our ſelves, the more we ſhall be abaſed, and lye low in our ſelves, and abhor our ſelves.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The reaſon why we are ſo proud of our ſelves, is, becauſe we are ſo ignorant of our ſelves. Did we know our own ignorance and miſ-underſtandings, as <hi>Job</hi> now at laſt did, we ſhould ſtrike ſail and come lower; much more, did we know all thoſe abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that are in our hearts, did we know what pride, and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and earthly-mindedneſs lye there, what inordinate creature, love what paſſions lye there, what envy lyeth
<pb n="835" facs="tcp:48669:430"/> there; did we underſtand how deceitful and falſe our hearts are, both towards God, our ſelves, and towards one another, we ſhould abhor our ſelves exceedingly. There are two things which we ſhould ſtudy, that we may walk humbly. Firſt, To know God; Secondly, To know our ſelves. A Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then ſaid that word <hi>(know thy ſelf) came down from heaven;</hi> and did we once know our ſelves aright, what frail, and blind, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful creatures we are, how humble and heavenly ſhould we be! rightly to know that we are creatures would cauſe us to live more like new creatures. <hi>David</hi> ſ eing ſome men do things ſo unlike men (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.20.) prayed thus, <hi>Put them in fear, O Lord, that the Nations may know themſelves to be but men.</hi> There are ſuch in the world as know not themſelves to be but men; they behave themſelves as if they were gods, and not men, as if they were all-ſufficient, or as if all their ſufficiency proceeded of themſelves, and they the founders of their own greatneſs and power. The <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> ſaid in plain terms, <hi>I will be like unto the moſt high,</hi> (Iſa. 14.14.) I do not reckon my ſelf amongſt mortals. There are many, who never attained that <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Princes height, who yet have much of his ſpirit, and ſpeak as if they knew themſelves to be more than men, at leaſt, as if they knew not themſelves to be but men, nor conſidered themſelves as frail, dying, and accountable creatures. Did we remember that we are but creatures, that we are the work of Gods hand, this would keep us low and humble; but did we know what ſinful polluted creatures we are, we ſhould ſoon come, not only to a lower eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, but an utter abhorrence of our ſelves. <hi>We over-think our ſelves, becauſe we do not know our ſelves;</hi> we over-rate our ſelves, becauſe we do not underſtand our ſelves. Even <hi>Job</hi> was too high in his own thoughts, in his own books, till he came to know and underſtand, that he had uttered things that he knew not, that he underſtood not. <hi>Wherefore,</hi>
                     <q>I abhor my ſelf, and repent in duſt and aſhes.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Obſerve, Thirdly;
<q>True repentance is joyned with ſelf-abhorrence, and with an abhorrence of all that we do, of all that we are.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>True repentance is joyned with an abhorrence,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Of ſinful ſelf, or of our ſelves for ſin. The Prophet ſpeaking of their repentance, who had gone a whoring from God,
<pb n="836" facs="tcp:48669:431"/> ſaith (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 6.9.) <hi>They ſhall loath themſelves for the evils which they have committed in all their abominations.</hi> And when the Lord had promiſed to bring the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to their own land, he tells them, what work they ſhall be at there (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.43.) <hi>There ſhall you remember your ways and doings, wherein you have been defiled, and ye ſhall loath your ſelves in your own ſight, for all the evils that ye have committed.</hi> Once more in that Prophet, (<hi>chap.</hi> 36.31.) <hi>Then ſhall ye remember your own evil ways, and your doings that were not good, and ſhall loath your ſelves in your own ſight for your iniquities, and for your abominations.</hi> In all theſe Scriptures we have loathing of ſelf for ſin and evil done. And as there is a loathing of ſinful ſelf in true repentance, ſo</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Of righteous ſelf, or a loathing of our ſelves in the good, in the beſt, that we have done. We may ſoon ſee that in the beſt of our duties, which will ſtir up this ſelf-abhorrence, or which gives us cauſe enough to abhor our ſelves. So <hi>Job</hi> did as to all the glitter of his moral vertues, of which he ſpake ſo much before in ſeveral places, eſpecially in the 31. chapter. He that truly repents, doth not only abhor his ſin, ſo as never to commit it again; but he abhorreth his righteouſneſs, ſo as never to truſt in it at all. Thus the Apoſtle ſpake (<hi>Phil.</hi> 3.7, 8.) <hi>I count all things but loſs for the excellency of the knowledge of Chriſt.</hi> What did he account loſs? not only the evil that he had done, but all the good that he had done; he accounted that but dung, that he might be found in Chriſt, not having his own righteouſneſs, which is of the law. Self-righteouſneſs is gold, and to be embraced in converſation; but 'tis dung, and to be abhorred in juſtification. <hi>Job</hi> abhorred his own righteouſneſs from the beginning of this diſpute in that point, though he ſpake ſo much of it (<hi>chap.</hi> 9.31.) <hi>If I waſh my ſelf with ſnow water, and make my hands never ſo clean, yet ſhalt thou plung me in the ditch, and mine own cloaths ſhall abhor me,</hi> or (as in the Margin) <hi>my own cloaths ſhall make me to be abhorred.</hi> What means he by his cloaths? Surely, not the cloaths that were upon his body, but his moral cloathing, his own works of righteouſneſs, according to the law. Theſe cloaths (ſaith he) will make me to be abhorred; I ſee, I cannot be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in them, nor juſtified by them. <hi>Job</hi> was clear in that before; but now he doth not only abhor his own righteouſneſs, as to truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in it, but as to talking ſo much of it, or ſo much as to talk of
<pb n="837" facs="tcp:48669:431"/> it. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doth;</hi> that is, take not much notice of thy own good deeds. As a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting perſon will not touch at all with his former evil deeds, ſo he will not talk, nor take much notice of his own good deeds. The beſt of himſelf is little to himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Before I paſs this point, it may be enquired, Firſt, what this ſelf-abhorrence, which accompanies true repentance, works in thoſe that have it, with reſpect to ſin, or ſinful ſelf.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, It works theſe five things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, A diſlike of ſinful ſelf; he grows into a diſtaſt with ſin, it reliſheth not his renewed palate, and ſo will not (like unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury meat) go down with him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, A hatred of ſinful ſelf. 'Tis but an eaſie ſtep from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſt and diſlike to hatred. That ſoon falls under our diſpleaſure which pleaſeth us not. No ſooner did <hi>Amnon</hi> diſlike his ſiſter <hi>Tamar,</hi> whom he inordinately liked a little before, but the Text ſaith (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.15.) <hi>He hated her exceedingly, ſo that the hatred wherewith he hated her, was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, An indignation againſt ſinful ſelf. The ſpirit of a true penitent riſeth againſt ſin, as againſt an open enemy, or a falſe friend (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.11.)</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, An utter averſation, or alienation from ſinfull ſelf. As they who live in ſin are averſe and alienated from the life of God, that is, from holineſs; ſo they who repent of ſin, are alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated and turned away from the ſins of their former life.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly and laſtly, An oppoſition againſt ſin. There is not bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a turning away from it, but a war againſt it, a deſire to deſtroy and mortifie it, to do it (as I may ſay) the greateſt miſchief we can. Thus diſlike is followed with hatred, and hatred with indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and indignation with averſation, and averſation with op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, wrought and riſing up in a penitent ſoul againſt ſin.</p>
                  <p>But, Secondly, it may be asked, why doth a repenting ſoul ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor ſinful ſelf?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, He doth it upon theſe four conſiderations.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe it appears to him as a filthy thing (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.5. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38.7. <hi>Prov.</hi> 12.22.) All which Scriptures ſhew, that as ſin is a filthy thing in it ſelf, ſo it appeareth ſuch to a repenting ſoul. They that love their ſins, look upon them as fine things, or
<pb n="838" facs="tcp:48669:432"/> as their beauty: but to a repenting ſoul, nothing appeareth more dirty and filthy; and who abhors not that which is ſo to him?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, A repenting ſoul looketh upon ſin as a hurtful thing to him. We naturally turn from, and abhor that which is ſo. We abhor the poyſon of a Toad, and the ſting of a Serpent: To taſte the one, or to be bitten by the other, is no more deadly to the body, than ſin is to the ſoul.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, A repenting ſoul is ſick, very ſick of his ſins, they have burdened his conſcience, as unwholſom food doth the ſtomack. Now, if a man abhors that which hath made him ſtomack-ſick, much more will he abhor that which hath indeed, and not ſo much from the quantity as from the quality and nature of it, made him conſcience-ſick.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, A repenting perſon hath vomited or caſt up his ſins by an humble confeſſion of them alwayes to God, and in ſome caſes to men (Repentance is the ſouls vomit.) Now, as any man loaths his own vomit; ſo a man truly repenting, loaths the ſin which he hath thus vomited. Upon all theſe accounts a repenting ſoul loaths <hi>ſinful ſelf, or ſin in himſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, But why doth a repenting ſoul abhor righteous ſelf? I anſwer,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe he is convinced, that ſelf-righteouſneſs is a weak imperfect thing, even in ſanctification; and therefore he is ſo far from boaſting of it, or truſting in it, that he hath a kind of abhorrence of it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, He ſeeth, that as to juſtification it is a filthy abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable thing (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.6.) <hi>All our righteouſneſs are as filthy rags.</hi> And as he abhors it, becauſe 'tis unfit and incompetent in it ſelf for that uſe, ſo becauſe 'tis utterly inconſiſtent with the tenour of the Goſpel, wherein God hath removed all mans righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, how pure ſoever it may be, from that uſe, and directed us to look only to the righteouſneſs of Chriſt for that uſe, which the Apoſtle calls the <hi>righteouſneſs of God (Rom.</hi> 10.3.) and that in a twofold reſpect. Firſt, becauſe 'tis that which the wiſdom of God the Father hath provided for us; and, Secondly, which the worthineſs of God the Son hath wrought out and procured for us.</p>
                  <p>Take two or three Inferences from the general Obſervation thus far proſecuted,
<q>
                        <pb n="839" facs="tcp:48669:432"/>That true repentance is joyned with ſelf abhorrence.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, Then ſelf-admirers are no repenters. They are at the furtheſt remove from abhorring themſelves, who admire them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Self-juſtifiers, are no true repenters. Chriſt told the Phariſees (<hi>Luke</hi> 16.15.) <hi>Ye are they which juſtifie your ſelves.</hi> They are far from abhorring themſelves, who juſtifie themſelves; ſuch ſurely are highly pleaſed with themſelves, and have much confidence in themſelves, therefore very far from ſelf-abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, What ſhall I ſay of their repentance, who inſtead of abhorring themſelves, abhor others? (<hi>Luke</hi> 18.9.) <hi>Chriſt ſpake a Parable unto certain which truſted in themſelves that they were righteous, and deſpiſed others,</hi> and preſently inſtanced in the Phariſee, who deſpiſed the poor Publican, and called him in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, <hi>This Publican;</hi> he would (as we ſay) hardly touch him with a pair of tongs. They that deſpiſe others, are uſually, if not alwayes, much pleaſed with themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, If theſe ſelf-boaſters, and ſelf-admirers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are not repenters, then, do they repent who are ſo far from abhorring ſinful ſelf, and righteous ſelf, that they take pleaſure in ſin and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs, whether their own or others? The Apoſtle ſpeaks of ſuch (<hi>Rom.</hi> 1.32.) <hi>Who knowing the judgement of God, that they which commit ſuch things, are worthy of death, not only do the ſame, but have pleaſure in them that do them.</hi> That's a dreadful word (2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.12.) <hi>That they all might be damned, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not the truth, but had pleaſure in unrighteouſneſs.</hi> O how far are they from abhorring their own righteouſneſs, who take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in unrighteouſneſs! How are they puffed up with that which hath but a ſhew of righteouſneſs, who pleaſe themſelves with that which is really unrighteous!</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, If true repentance be accompanied with ſelf-abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, then do they repent, who return to thoſe ſins which they ſay they have repented of? do you think the dog loaths his vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, when you ſee him go back and lick it up again? (2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.22.) When once the <hi>Jews</hi> loathed or abhorred <hi>Manna,</hi> they had no mind to eat of it, though it was Angels food. When <hi>Job</hi> loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his life, he ſaid, he would live no longer (Chap. 7.16.) <hi>I
<pb n="838" facs="tcp:48669:433"/>
                        <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">

                        <pb n="840" facs="tcp:48669:434"/> loath it, I would not live alwayes;</hi> that is, not at all, not an hour longer in this world. He that is weary of his life, thinks, to live but a day, or a little longer, is to live alwayes, or that his life will never end. Thus, if a man doth truly loath and abhor his ſin, he will not return to it again, though it hath been as ſweet to him as <hi>Manna,</hi> yea, as <hi>life</hi> it ſelf. I do not ſay, that he who loaths and abhors his ſin, can never relapſe into the ſame ſin, or be overta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with it again; but this I ſay, he that truly repents, never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in ſin again, he never goeth back to it, and licketh it up as a dog his vomit. <hi>A good man may fall into the ſame ſin, but he never returneth to the ſame ſin; he may be overtaken with the ſame ſin, but he never taketh up the ſame ſin again.</hi> That's the Apoſtles word (<hi>Gal.</hi> 6.1.) <hi>If any of you be overtaken with a fault,</hi> &amp;c. A good man may be overtaken with the ſame fault, but he never taketh up that fault, nor runs a courſe in that ſin again.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall only add theſe two words, for the working of our ſouls to this ſelf-abhorrence.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The more we abhor our ſelves, the more God delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in us; the more we are diſpleaſed with our ſins, the more is he pleaſed with our perſons, the worſe, the viler we are in our own eyes, the better we are, and the more beautiful in the eye of God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Unleſs we abhor our ſelves, God will abhor us. I may ſay, unleſs we ſo repent as to abhor our ſelves, God will ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor our very repentance. There is no true repentance, without ſome degree of ſelf-abhorrence; yea, of ſelf-condemnation. Let us not take up this word <hi>repentance</hi> too eaſily, that is, when we know not what this word <hi>ſelf-abhorrence</hi> meaneth. We defile this holy, this precious thing called <hi>repentance,</hi> when our hearts are not fully taken off from that or thole ſins, of which we ſay we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent. All ſuch would have that go for repentance towards God, which indeed is but a mocking of God, and can never be joyned (from which true repentance cannot be ſeparated) with faith to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward our Lord Jeſus Chriſt (<hi>Acts</hi> 20.21.) <hi>I abhor my ſelf</hi> (ſaid <hi>Job</hi>)
<q>And repent in duſt and aſhes.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall here give ſomewhat about the nature of repentance in
<pb n="841" facs="tcp:48669:434"/> general, and then gather up thoſe particular Obſervations which ariſe from theſe words about it.</p>
                  <q>Repentance is a grace of the Goſpel wrought in the heart of a ſinner by the Word and Spirit, turning the whole man from all ſin, to God, in the ſincere and univerſal obedience of his holy will.</q>
                  <p>In this deſcription of repentance, we have four things conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The nature of it, or what it is, <hi>A grace of the Goſpel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, The ſeat of it, or where it is wrought, <hi>The heart of a ſinner.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The means by which it is wrought, and that twofold. Firſt, Inſtrumental, <hi>The Word.</hi> Secondly, Principal, <hi>The Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The iſſue or effect of it, <hi>Converſion</hi> or <hi>turning;</hi> wherein two things are to be taken notice of. Firſt, the term from which the turn is made, <hi>Sin, and all ſin.</hi> Secondly, the term to which the turn is made, <hi>God;</hi> thus explained, In the ſincere or univerſal obedience of his holy will, or in the practice of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry known duty.</p>
                  <p>Firſt (I ſay) <hi>Repentance is a grace of the Goſpel.</hi> Some poſſibly may ſay, <hi>Job</hi> was before the Goſpel. I anſwer, no; The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel was publiſhed long before <hi>Job</hi> was born, even as ſoon as God promiſed <hi>the ſeed of the woman</hi> (Chriſt Jeſus) <hi>ſhould bruiſe the Serpents head (Gen.</hi> 3.15.)</p>
                  <p>The whole body of Goſpel duty moves upon theſe two feet, <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance.</hi> Some have queſtioned, which of theſe two graces hath the precedency, or takes the firſt ſtep in the motion of the ſoul heaven-ward? All that I ſhall ſay in anſwer to it, is, Firſt, that where theſe two graces are mentioned together in Scripture, uſually repentance is named firſt, becauſe it appears firſt, and is moſt viſible to us in its actings; yet Faith is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood firſt, becauſe without that no man can come to Chriſt as a true penitent, for pardon of ſin and reconciliation unto God. Secondly, in thoſe Scriptures, where true ſaving repentance is ſpoken of alone, it ſuppoſeth faith alſo; and where true ſaving faith only is ſpoken of, it neceſſarily implyeth true repentance.</p>
                  <p>This repentance is ſo much a grace of the Goſpel, that the firſt Sermon that ever was preacht at the approach of Chriſt, or at the
<pb n="842" facs="tcp:48669:435"/> opening of the Goſpel in the new Teſtament, was, <hi>Repent ye, for the Kingdom of heaven is at hand (Mat.</hi> 3.2.) And the end or deſign of the firſt Sacrament or ſeal of the Goſpel-covenant, is expreſſed to be repentance (<hi>Mat.</hi> 3.11.) <hi>I baptize you with water unto repentance;</hi> yea, the firſt word of the firſt Sermon (upon record) which Chriſt himſelf preached in perſon, was, <hi>Repent</hi> (Mat. 4.17.) <hi>From that time Jeſus began to preach, and to ſay, repent.</hi> This alſo was the ſubſtance of the Apoſtles Sermons, when firſt ſent forth by Chriſt to preach the Goſpel (<hi>Mark</hi> 6.12.) <hi>They went out and preached, that men ſhould repent.</hi> The firſt word of counſel which the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> gave to the <hi>Jews,</hi> crying out, <hi>men and brethren, what ſhall we do,</hi> was, <hi>Repent (Acts</hi> 2.38.) And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that the whole of his work in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Goſpel, was his <hi>teſtifying both to</hi> Jews <hi>and</hi> Gentiles, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jeſus Chriſt (Act.</hi> 20.21.) 'Tis through the Goſpel only, that repentance is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. And this appears two wayes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe we have not a liberty to repent, or we are not admitted to repent, but by the Goſpel. We find no place for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance in the Law ſtrictly taken, or as oppoſed to the Goſpel. The Law ſpeaks thus (<hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10.) <hi>Curſed is every one that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth not in all things, that are written in the book of the Law, to do them.</hi> Where we ſee, Firſt, the Law requires perſonal obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; <hi>every one</hi> muſt do for himſelf. Secondly, The Law requires perpetual obedience, <hi>every one that continueth not doing.</hi> Thirdly, The Law requires univerſal obedience, <hi>every one that continueth not in all things.</hi> If any one continue not at all times in all things (ſaith the Law) or if he fail but once in any one thing, he is gone for ever, he is curſed. The Law doth not ſay, if a man continue not to do all, let him repent; that admits no ſecond thoughts, but claps the curſe preſently upon the offender. If <hi>Adam</hi> as ſoon as he had eaten of the forbidden tree, had bewailed his ſin, and ſaid, I repent, no favour could have been ſhewed him, while under the Law.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Under the Law there is no ability given for repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. All the promiſes of a broken heart, and of godly ſorrow, are appendants of the Goſpel. This ſpiritual curſe which falls upon the ſoul ſinning under the Law, is impenitency for ſin. Death in ſin, is the puniſhment of ſin; and therefore when <hi>Adam</hi> had
<pb n="843" facs="tcp:48669:435"/> ſinned, he never gave the leaſt intimation of, nor ſhewed the leaſt inclination to repentance; all he did, was to hide himſelf from God among the trees of the garden, and to hide his ſin from God (as well as he could) by vain excuſes; he had not a heart to mourn for his ſin, nor a tongue to confeſs it, till the Promiſe came, and the Goſpel was publiſhed, and then (though his repentance be not mentioned, yet) doubtleſs he repented. And hence the Apoſtle concludes Apoſtates from the profeſſion which they once made of Chriſt, under an utter impoſſibily of repentance (<hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4, 5, 6.) And the reaſon why the fallen Angels never repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was becauſe they had no Mediator, nor did Jeſus Chriſt take their nature on him (<hi>Heb.</hi> 2.16.) Thus far of the firſt thing in the deſcription of repentance, the general nature of it; 'tis a grace of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Conſider the ſeat or ſubject of it, where 'tis wrought, the heart of a ſinner. Repentance is <hi>heart-work,</hi> or it is a work upon the heart: There repentance began in thoſe converts (<hi>Act.</hi> 2.37.) whom the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> adviſed to a thorough work of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance (<hi>verſ.</hi> 38.) The promiſe of repentance runs in this te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, <hi>I will take away</hi> (ſaith the Lord, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26.) <hi>the heart of ſtone out of your fleſh, and give you an heart of fleſh.</hi> When <hi>David</hi> ſaid (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.17.) <hi>A broken and contrite heart</hi> (he means only a repenting heart) <hi>O God thou wilt not deſpiſe.</hi> As faith is wrought in the heart, <hi>and with the heart man believeth (Rom.</hi> 10.10.) ſo repentance is wrought in the heart, and with the heart man repenteth. Neither a weeping eye, nor a confeſſing tongue, nor (in caſe of wrong done to man) a reſtoring hand, will be taken for repentance, without a broken heart.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Conſider the means by which ſaving repentance, or repentance to ſalvation, is wrought. 1ſt. the Word; 2ly. the Spirit. The Word of God is the uſual, the ordinary inſtrument in the hand, that is, in the power of the Spirit of God, working repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in the heart of man. The word of a Philoſopher, with all his reaſonings; the word of an Orator, with all his flouriſhings, cannot do it: only the Word of God ſpoken in plainneſs and ſimplicity, hath ſtrength and efficacy to do it. The Word is compared <hi>to a fire,</hi> which melts the hardeſt heart; 'tis alſo in the ſame place (<hi>Jer.</hi> 23.29.) compared to <hi>a hammer, which breaketh the rock in pieces.</hi> The Word paſſing through the ear,
<pb n="844" facs="tcp:48669:436"/> pierceth the heart (<hi>Acts</hi> 2.27.) <hi>Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart.</hi> And when, even the devils Devotio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts, they <hi>that uſed curious arts, burnt their books</hi> (Acts 19.19.) it is ſaid (<hi>verſ.</hi> 20.) <hi>ſo mightily grew the Word of God and prevailed.</hi> The word of God cloathed with the Spirit, hath (as to this matter) a fourfold operation. Firſt, to awaken a drowſie ſoul (<hi>Eph.</hi> 5.14.) Secondly, to enlighten a dark ſoul (<hi>Acts</hi> 26.18.) Thirdly, to convince a gain-ſaying ſoul. Fourthly, to convert a wandring ſoul (<hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.9.) Till the ſoul is awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened, it cannot be enlightned; till it is enlightned, it cannot be convinced; till it is convinced, it cannot be converted; and until it is all this, it hath not truly repented. For,</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, (as was ſaid in the deſcription firſt laid down) the effect of true repentance, is the turning of the whole man from all ſin to God. All the members of the body, the hand, the foot, the eyes, the ears, the tongue, are turned; all the faculties of the ſoul, the underſtanding, will, affections, are turned from all ſin: Firſt, of what kind ſoever, whether of omiſſion or commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion againſt God, neighbour, ſelf. Secondly, of what degree ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; little, as well as great; appearances of evil, as well as appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent evils.</p>
                  <p>Further, as in repentance there is a turning from ſin, ſo unto God, in the ſincere obedience of his whole will. We read in Scripture, Firſt, of Gods returning to us; Secondly, of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to God: both are acts of repentance. When God returns to us, he repents of the evil of trouble brought, or threatned to be brought upon us; and when we return to God, that's a fruit of our repentance, for the evil of ſin committed againſt him. Unleſs our repentance bring us neerer to God, we (as we ſay) are never the neer for our repentance; that is, our repentance is not good, nor ſhall we have any good by it. The Prophet found <hi>Iſraels</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance defective in this (<hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7.16.) <hi>They return, but not to the moſt high.</hi> Some in repenting, return only to ſelf; that is, their own peace, intereſt and advantage, is all that moves them to it, or is deſigned and aimed at by them in it; they mind not the glory of God, nor his reparation in honour, which hath been by their ſin greatly impaired. The Lord was down-right with <hi>Iſrael</hi> in this (<hi>Jer.</hi> 4.1.) <hi>If thou wilt return, O</hi> Iſrael, <hi>ſaith the Lord, return unto me;</hi> intimating, that <hi>Iſrael</hi> uſed to make ſome kind of
<pb n="845" facs="tcp:48669:436"/> repenting turns, but ſhort of God; they minded not God ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in them, but the removal of ſome rod or trouble that was come, or which they feared was coming upon them. They return to God in repenting, who repent with a holy reſolve upon their hearts to obey God, and with a longing deſire to enjoy God all the days of their life.</p>
                  <p>Thus upon the occaſion of <hi>Jobs</hi> ſaying, <hi>I repent,</hi> I have briefly opened the duty of repentance, of ſuch a repentance as without all peradventure <hi>Job</hi> was then exerciſed in: His was the grace of repentance, his repentance was wrought in his heart, chiefly by the immediate word and ſpeakings of God to him; He turned fully in it from all his paſſions and expoſtulations with God (which were at that time his ſpecial ſin) to a meek, quiet ſubmiſſion to the will of God, and a reſting in his diſpenſations. All this was wrapped up in this ſhort word, <hi>I repent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Further, conſider, when <hi>Job</hi> ſaid, <hi>I repent in duſt and aſhes;</hi> he was not then to begin his repentance, he had repented long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; yet then he began a new work of repentance, or then he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed his repentance.</p>
                  <p>Hence note, Firſt;
<q>New ſinnings call for new repentings.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>As the new leakings of a ſhip calls for new pumpings and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairs; ſo, I ſay, new ſins call for new repentings. There is a firſt repentance, and there is a ſecond repentance: Firſt Repentance is our coming out of a ſtate of ſin, of which Chriſt ſpake (<hi>Mat.</hi> 11.20, 21.) <hi>Then began he to upbraid the Cities, wherein moſt of his mighty works were done, becauſe they repented not: Wo unto you</hi> Chorazin, <hi>and wo unto you</hi> Bethſaida; <hi>for if the mighty works which were done in you, had been done in</hi> Tyre <hi>and</hi> Sidon, <hi>they would have repented long ago in ſackcloth and aſhes;</hi> that is, they had come out of their ſins. Thoſe converts in the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles</hi> (chap. 2.38.) repented, that is, <hi>they came out of a ſinful ſtate.</hi> Now, as there is a repentance, which I call our coming out of a ſtate of ſin; ſo there is a repentance, which is a coming off from this and that act of ſin; and this is the repentance which <hi>Job</hi> was upon.</p>
                  <pb n="846" facs="tcp:48669:437"/>
                  <p>Again; this repentance, as to acts of ſin, is two-fold. Firſt, Our ordinary and every days repentance. Secondly, Our extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary repentance. When we have fallen greatly, when we have ſinned extraordinary, of when the Lord brings any extraordinary judgment upon us, then the Lord expects extraordinary repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: ſuch was <hi>Davids</hi> repentance in the 51. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> and ſuch was <hi>Jobs</hi> repentance here; as it was in general for ſin, ſo for ſome extraordinary ſinful failings.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Conſider what was <hi>Jobs</hi> ſin? <hi>Job</hi> was no vile per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, he had committed no groſs acts of wickedneſs. If you would know what <hi>Jobs</hi> ſin was, it was impatience under Gods dealings with him, and his diſtruſtfulneſs as to Gods delivering of him; yet even his were great ſins.</p>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>Not only groſs ſins, murder, adultery, and the oppreſſion of our neighbours are great ſins; but impatiency under the hand of God, and unwary ſpeeches concerning the dealings of God with us, are great ſins.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Every great ſin is not a groſs ſin. Drunkenneſs, and ſwearing and adultery, and murder, are groſs ſins; but impatience under afflictions and unbelief, not reſting upon God in an evil day, theſe are great ſins, though not groſs ſins. Remember, not only are groſs ſins great ſins; but many ſins, which appear not to the eye, nor to the ear, may yet be great ſins, eſpecially, as to the perſon that committeth them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, note;
<q>Not groſs ſins only, but ſlips of the tongue, and impatiency under Gods hand are to be repented of.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Job</hi> not only acknowledged theſe to be ſins, but repenteth of theſe; nor had he any other matter to repent of. When we are under ſome great ſickneſs, or any other affliction, as we are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of former ſins, ſo let us repent of our ſickneſs and affliction-ſins, that is of impatience, or any unwary ſpeeches in our afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Theſe <hi>Job</hi> repented of.</p>
                  <p>Again; how did <hi>Job</hi> repent? It was <hi>in duſt and aſhes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="847" facs="tcp:48669:437"/>
                  <p>Hence Obſerve, Fourthly;
<q>Open ſins muſt have open repentance.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>That's intended by repenting in duſt and aſhes. We are not bound to repent openly of all our ſins; but in in theſe two caſes we are. Firſt, When we have done any thing that hath openly diſhonoured God. Secondly, When we have ſcandalized or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended others. In theſe caſes we muſt repent openly, ſo far, that they who are concerned may have a teſtimony of our repentance. When <hi>Job</hi> repented in duſt and aſhes, he (like thoſe ſervants of <hi>Benhadad,</hi> who came with ropes about their necks) teſtified that he deſerved to be thrown into the duſt, or to be burnt to aſhes. We can neither edifie nor ſatisfie ſuch as are grieved by our ſins, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs our repentance be viſible, and we appear repenting. As the light (of our zeal) muſt ſo ſhine before men, that they may ſee our good works; ſo the light of our repentance muſt ſo ſhine before men, that they may ſee us humbled for, and turning from our evil works, and glorifie our father which is in heaven.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Note;
<q>We may teſtifie our repentance by outward ſigns.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here was not only the reallity of repentance, but the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of it. There are many outward ſigns of repentance ſpoken of in Scripture: Such are, Firſt, <hi>Smiting upon the thigh;</hi> thus <hi>Ephraim</hi> is deſcribed repenting (<hi>Jerem.</hi> 31.19.) Secondly, <hi>Smiting upon the breaſt;</hi> ſo the Publican is deſcribed repenting (<hi>Luke</hi> 18.13.) <hi>He ſmote upon his breaſt, and ſaid, God be merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to me a ſinner.</hi> Thirdly, Laying aſide our ornaments; thus the Lord commanded the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> (Exod. 33.5.) <hi>Put off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know to do unto thee;</hi> as if God had ſaid, humble thy ſelf openly and repent. F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>urthly, The putting on of ſack-cloth; this the <hi>Jews</hi> were called to do (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 22.12.) Fifthly, Holding down the head. The <hi>Jews</hi> (Iſa. 58.5.) were not reproved for doing that, but becauſe they did it like a bull-ruſh, only when a ſtorm was upon them: Sixthly, Renting the garment, and walking ſoftly. So did <hi>Ahab</hi> (1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21.27.) Seventhly, as in the text <hi>Job</hi> ſaith he did, ſitting in duſt and aſhes. I do not ſay theſe, or the like, are abſolutely neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to repentance, but they are lawful, and have their uſe. When
<pb n="848" facs="tcp:48669:438"/> the Prophet (<hi>Joel</hi> 2.13.) ſaid, <hi>Rent your hearts, not your gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> that is, rent your hearts, rather than your garments; it was not a prohibition, but a direction: or if rent your gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, be ſure you rent your hearts alſo, elſe all your outward modes of repentance are in vain and inſignificant.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Bellarminus</hi> l. <hi>1.</hi> de poeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio c. <hi>7.</hi> SS. per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curramus.</note> Some Popiſh Writers make the eſſence of repentance to conſiſt in theſe or ſuch like outward ſigns; but though we deny that, yet we grant theſe may be ſigns of true repentance: For as to bow the knee is not to pray, although he that prayeth uſually boweth the knees, as a ſign of an humble heart in prayer; ſo to ſit in the duſt and weep, is not to repent, although the truly penitent, uſually do ſo. The eſſence of repentance conſiſts in a broken heart for ſin, and in breaking off the courſe and cuſtome of ſin, turning to God fully.</p>
                  <p>Further, this outward ceremony of ſitting in duſt and aſhes, intimates the greatneſs of <hi>Jobs</hi> repentance, or that he repented greatly, under a deep ſenſe of, and with bitter mournings for his former miſcarriages in the time of his affliction.</p>
                  <p>Hence note, Sixthly;
<q>A ſoul truly humbled maketh a very ſerzous work of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Poenitet me ex enime, &amp; ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dioſiſſimè, quod illis externa ſymbolis ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficabatur. <hi>Jun.</hi>
                     </note>It is a common thing to ſay, <hi>I repent;</hi> but few know what it is to repent in duſt and aſhes. They who repent indeed, judge, arraign and condemn themſelves as at Gods tribunal, they put their mouths in the very duſt. Repentan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e is heart work, and deep work<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they who are brought in a ſpiritual ſenſe to duſt and aſhes, find it ſo. Though ſome ſinners corrupt themſelves and their ways, more deeply than others, yet all ſin is of a deep dye, and corrupts deeply, and therefore calls for deep, for heart-deep mournings and repentings in duſt and aſhes.</p>
                  <p>Note, Seventhly;
<q>God will not give over dealing with his ſinning ſervants, till he hath brought them to true contrition for their ſins.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>How long was <hi>Job</hi> dealt with by his friends, and by <hi>Elihu,</hi> and by God himſelf, before his heart was wrought into this frame and temper, to repent in duſt and aſhes? It was long before he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood that God might break in innocent perſon to pieces, and give no account why. God did not give over afflicting <hi>Job,</hi> till
<pb n="849" facs="tcp:48669:438"/> he came to that acknowledgment. <hi>Job</hi> ſaid (<hi>Chap.</hi> 40.4.) <hi>I am vile;</hi> and it might be thought, that had been repentance ſufficient: But though <hi>Job</hi> was then brought low, yet he was not brought low enough: he cryed, <hi>I am vile,</hi> but till God ſpake to him of <hi>Behemoth</hi> and <hi>Leviathan</hi> he repented not in duſt and aſhes. <hi>Ephraim</hi> ſaid (<hi>Jer.</hi> 31.18, 19.) <hi>Thou haſt chaſtiſed me, and I was chaſtiſed, as a bullock unaccuſtomed to the yoke: turn thou me, and I ſhall be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; thou art the Lord my God. Surely, after that I was turned, I repented; and after that I was inſtructed, I ſmote upon my thigh, I was aſhamed, yea, even confounded, becauſe I did bear the reproach of my youth.</hi> The Lord never left ſmiting <hi>Ephraim,</hi> till he made him ſmite upon his thigh. If we do not come home in the work of repentance, by words, God will fetch us home with his rods.</p>
                  <p>In the eighth place; If we conſider this repentance of <hi>Job,</hi> with what followeth preſently upon it, his reſtauration,</p>
                  <p>Obſerve;
<q>When we are deeply humbled and brought low, we are near our exaltation.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>When <hi>Job</hi> lay in duſt and aſhes, God was about to ſet him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a mountain, a mountain of proſperity, and that a higher one than ever he was upon before (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 126.5, 6.) They that <hi>ſow in tears, ſhall reap in joy; they that go forth weeping, bearing precious ſeed, ſhall doubtleſs come again with rejoycing, bringing their ſheaves with them.</hi> Therefore take the Apoſtles counſel (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.6.) <hi>Humble your ſelves under the mighty hand of God</hi> (and what then?) <hi>he will exalt you in due time.</hi> The due time of our lifting up is at hand, when we are laid low and ſincerely humbled under the hand of God. <hi>Jobs</hi> humiliation and reſtauration did almoſt ſynchronize, or come near in time together.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, Note;
<q>True repentance endeth in true joy.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The word which ſignifies to be grieved, ſignifieth alſo to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce; and <hi>Job</hi> found it ſo, he was comforted as ſoon as fully humbled. Repentance iſſueth in joy three ways.</p>
                  <pb n="850" facs="tcp:48669:439"/>
                  <p>Firſt, There is joy in heaven when a ſinner repenteth (<hi>Luke</hi> 15.7.) As he that found his loſt ſheep brought it home, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced in it more than over the ninety and nine that did not go aſtray: So (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>there is joy in heaven over one ſinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine juſt perſons that need no repentance.</hi> True ſorrow on earth maketh joy in heaven.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There is joy in the Church; The godly on earth rejoyce at the known repentance of a ſinner. When the prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal ſon came home, his father ſaid to his diſcontented brother, <hi>It was meet that we ſhould make merry and be glad; for this thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was dead, and is alive again, he was loſt, and is found.</hi> The Apoſtle greatly rejoyced at the repentance of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.9.) <hi>Now I rejoyce, not that ye were made ſorry, but that you ſorrowed to repentance.</hi> Their ſorrow occaſion'd his joy, yet not that, but their repentance was the cauſe of it. There is no better joy on earth, than that which ariſeth out of the duſt of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting ſorrows. As the Apoſtle <hi>John had no greater joy than to hear that his</hi> (ſpiritual) <hi>children walked in the truth</hi> (Epheſ. 3.4.) So, what greater joy can we have, than to ſee any who had gone aſtray from, returning to the truth?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Repentance iſſueth in joy chiefly to the ſoul repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. If other mens repentance cauſeth our joy, our own will cauſe it much more (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.10.) <hi>Godly ſorrow worketh repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to ſalvation, not to be repented of.</hi> The Apoſtles meaning is more than he ſpeaks; repentance not to be repented of, is repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to be rejoyced and gloried in. We cannot take comfort in our ſins, but we may take much comfort in repenting for our ſins, as that repentance is joyned with faith in Chriſt, who hath given us power to repent, and who is for himſelf to be rejoyced in.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Take this general note from the whole matter.</p>
                  <q>The ſpeakings of God to man, whether mediate or immediate, are mighty and effectual.</q>
                  <p>The ſpeaking of man to man barely can do nothing, but the ſpeaking of man to man in the power of God will do much; how much more if God himſelf ſpeak! God ſpake to <hi>Job,</hi> and theſe mighty effects followed.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Self-abhorrence.</p>
                  <pb n="851" facs="tcp:48669:439"/>
                  <p>Secondly, Deep repentance.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Full ſubmiſſion to the will of God.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, A readineſs to teſtifie, by all due means, how vile, how miſerable he was; yet cleaving faſt to, and depending fully upon God, by faith in the promiſe, for mercy, peace, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, A change both of mind and manners, both in thought, word and way. <hi>Job</hi> thought no more as he had done, he ſpake no more as he had done, he acted no more as he had done in that condition, he was another manner of man than before; a good man he was before, but now a better; he came out of the fire of that affliction, and off from the heat of that long diſputation, as gold well refined.</p>
                  <p>So much of this verſe, which concludes the firſt part of the chapter, <hi>Jobs</hi> humiliation: the ſecond followeth, his friends re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation both to God and himſelf.</p>
                  <p>The Reader may here pleaſe to take notice, that from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the third chapter to this place, the writing is in verſe; the latter part of the chapter and book is proſe.</p>

                  <p>THeſe three verſes contain the ſecond part of the chapter, in which the Lord,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Reproves <hi>Jobs</hi> three friends (ver. 7.)</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Directs them what to do for the making up of the breach, or for their reconciliation (ver. 8.)</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Accepts them; that is, <hi>Job,</hi> praying for them, the breach was healed, and they reconciled (ver. 9.)</p>
                  <p>So then, here God appeareth as a Judge of the cauſe, and as a moderator of the controverſie between <hi>Job</hi> and his friends; and he appeared as a gracious judge, ready to be reconciled to thoſe whom he had blamed, and reproved for their folly and miſappre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of him, in his afflicting providences towards <hi>Job.</hi>

                     <bibl>
                        <hi>Verſ. 7.</hi>
                     </bibl> And it was ſo, that after the Lord had ſpoken theſe words unto <hi>Job,</hi> the Lord ſaid to <hi>Eliphaz</hi> the <hi>Temanite,</hi> my wrath is kindled againſt thee, and againſt thy two friends; for ye have not ſpoken of me the thing that is right, as my ſervant <hi>Job</hi> hath.</q>
                  <p>In this verſe we have the divine Judgement given in <hi>Jobs</hi> caſe, and in it there are four things conſiderable.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The time or ſeaſon of it, thus expreſt; <hi>And it was ſo, that after the Lord had ſpoken theſe words unto Job.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, The manner of it; <hi>The Lord ſaid,</hi> he declared his mind.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The ſpecial perſon with whom the Lord dealt, and whom he choſe out to declare his mind reſpectively to the other two; <hi>Eliphaz the Temanite.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The decree or judgement it ſelf, in which we may conſider two things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The matter of it; <hi>My wrath</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>is kindled againſt thee, and thy two friends;</hi> I am not pleaſed with any of you, yea, I am highly diſpleaſed, <hi>My wrath is kindled.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, The ground of it, plainly expreſt in theſe words; <hi>For ye have not ſpoken of me the thing that is right, as my ſervant</hi> Job <hi>hath.</hi> As if the Lord had ſaid, if you would know the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why I am ſo angry, 'tis this; <hi>Ye have not ſpoken of me the thing that is right, as my ſervant</hi> Job <hi>hath.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus we have the ſtate of theſe three verſes, and the parts of this ſeventh, wherein God appeareth as a determiner of this long diſputed controverſie, between <hi>Job</hi> and his three friends.</p>
                  <q>And it was ſo, that after the Lord had ſpoken theſe words un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Job.</q>
                  <p>Here is the time when the Lord gave this judgement, that's the firſt thing to be conſidered in this verſe; and it may be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned, whether the Lord gave this Judgement immediately after he had concluded his ſpeech with <hi>Job,</hi> and <hi>Job</hi> had made his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion to the Lord? or whether there were ſome ſpace of time between? The word <hi>after</hi> may be either <hi>preſently after,</hi> or a good while after; here is no expreſs limitation of the time, it being only ſaid, <hi>After the Lord had ſpoken theſe words unto Job.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="854" facs="tcp:48669:441"/>
                  <p>Some conceive it was a good while after God had done with <hi>Job,</hi> that he took his friends to task, and they ground it upon thoſe words, in the 8th verſe, <hi>Take unto you ſeven Bullocks, and ſeven Rams, and go to my ſervant Job:</hi> And it is ſaid at the 9th verſe, <hi>That they went and did according to what the Lord had comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</hi> Hence they collect, that <hi>Jobs</hi> friends were either returned quite home, or far upon their way, when the Lord ſpake this.</p>
                  <p>But this reaſon hath no force in it, to prove that <hi>Jobs</hi> friends were abſent; and therefore I rather conclude, that God ſpake to, and gave this judgement of <hi>Jobs</hi> friends (as it were) upon the place, as ſoon as he had done with <hi>Job;</hi> for 'tis more than proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that <hi>Jobs</hi> friends ſtayed to hear both <hi>Elihu</hi>'s ſpeech, and the diſcourſe which the Lord made to <hi>Job</hi> out of the whirlwind; and that as ſoon as he had done, and <hi>Job</hi> ſubmitted, he preſently paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed this ſentence for the comfort of <hi>Job,</hi> and for the conviction of his friends.</p>
                  <p>So then, as ſoon as the Lord had ſpoken theſe words, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed his buſineſs with <hi>Job,</hi> when he had humbled <hi>Job,</hi> when <hi>Job</hi> had repented and confeſſed his fault, in uttering things that he underſtood not, God proceeded preſently to deal with <hi>Jobs</hi> three friends. There are three things which give evidence to this.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The Lord would not let them continue long in their hard opinion of <hi>Job.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, If they had continued any long time unreproved, they might poſſibly have gloried as if they had got the victory, and had the better of <hi>Job.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, They might have raiſed ſome undue report of <hi>Job,</hi> and have blamed him among others where they came, as they had done to his face; therefore, the Lord to prevent their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing in any hard opinion of <hi>Job,</hi> or that they had got the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Job,</hi> or to ſtop their mouths from giving forth any hard words of <hi>Job,</hi> preſently called them to an account, gave them to underſtand, that they had ſpoken amiſs, and he, as it were, with the ſame breath comforted <hi>Job,</hi> and convicted his three friends.</p>
                  <p>Hence note, Firſt;
<q>God doth every thing in its proper ſeaſon.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>That which is ſeaſonably done, is doubly done. <hi>Words in ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="855" facs="tcp:48669:441"/> are like apples of gold, in pictures of ſilver;</hi> and therefore the Lord, who knows all ſeaſons, will do and ſpeak in ſeaſon, and take the fitteſt ſeaſon for every work and word, for every thing he either doth or ſaith. This ſhould teach us to mind the due timing, both of our actions and ſpeeches, eſpecially of our reproofs; we ſhould not let thoſe who have committed a fault, go too long unreproved, leſt they think themſelves faultleſs, and that we approve them, or at leaſt that their fault is ſmall, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt faultleſs. We muſt not <hi>ſuffer ſin upon our brother (Lev.</hi> 19.17.) But it may be ſaid, how ſhall we hinder it? That Text tells us how, <hi>Thou ſhalt in any wiſe rebuke him.</hi> Though a man that is rebuked may keep his ſin upon him, and continue in it, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding our ſevereſt and diſcreeteſt rebukes; yet he that rebukes a ſinning brother, doth not ſuffer ſin upon him, but hath done his duty, and uſed the means appointed by God for the removing of it. And as we ſhould not <hi>let the Sun go down upon our wrath</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt other men, <hi>nor give place to the devil</hi> in our ſelves (<hi>Eph.</hi> 4.26.27.) ſo we ſhould not ſuffer the Sun to go down upon the ſin of other men, nor give place to the devil in them, by our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance to rebuke them for their ſin. Thus the Lord dealt with <hi>Jobs</hi> three friends; he ſpeedily reproved them for their error, in not ſpeaking of him the thing that was right.</p>
                  <p>Further conſider, The Lord begins with <hi>Job,</hi> and then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to deal with his friends; <hi>Job</hi> had the firſt reproof, his friends the ſecond.</p>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>The Lord reproves them firſt, whom he reſpects moſt, who are deareſt to him.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>We cannot ſhew our ſelves more friendly to any man, than by an early reproof of his error, or as the word is (<hi>Lev.</hi> 19.17.) <hi>by not ſuffering ſin upon him.</hi> 'Tis a mercy (when we reprove not our ſelves) to meet with a reproof (though late) from others; but to be ſoon reproved, is much mercy. Every good, the ſooner it comes to us, the better it is. To be helpt out of ſin-evil, is a great good; and therefore, when we are in a fault with others, 'tis a priviledge to be reproved before others, and with all poſſible ſpeed to be brought unto repentance. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.17.) <hi>Judgement begins at the houſe of God.</hi> The Lord judgeth his own
<pb n="856" facs="tcp:48669:442"/> houſe, before he judgeth the world: and it is in mercy to his own houſe, that he doth ſo; for when God judgeth thoſe of his houſe, <hi>he chaſtneth them, that they ſhould not be condemned with the world</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.32.) And as God uſually begins to judge his own houſe before he judgeth the world, ſo the neerer and dearer any of his houſe are to him, the ſooner he begins with them; as here, <hi>Jobs</hi> three friends, <hi>Eliphaz, Bildad</hi> and <hi>Zophar,</hi> were of Gods houſe, but <hi>Job</hi> was more eminent than any of them, and therefore God reproved him, before he reproved them. <hi>It was ſo, that after the Lord had ſpoken theſe words unto Job,</hi>
                     <q>
                        <p>The Lord ſaid to <hi>Eliphaz</hi> the <hi>Temanite,</hi> my wrath is kindled againſt thee, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Lord ſaid.</p>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe words contain the ſecond thing to be conſidered in this verſe, to wit, the manner of proceeding, <hi>He ſaid;</hi> that is, he openly declared it, he did not whiſper it in the ear of <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> he did not ſpeak it to him inwardly by his Spirit (there are inward reproofs, conſcience-checks) he did not ſpeak to him in his ſleep, or in a dream (that opinion of one upon this place, that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved <hi>Eliphaz</hi> in a dream, is but a dream) but openly, that all might hear, and ſo the innocency of <hi>Job,</hi> and the fault of his friends, might be manifeſt to all. Some are of opinion, that the Lord ſaid this to <hi>Eliphaz</hi> out of the whirlwind, as he ſpake to <hi>Job.</hi> And though I do not aſſert that, yet it cannot be denied, but that as ſuch a manner of ſpeaking did beſt ſuit the Majeſty of God, ſo the matter ſpoken, which was a ſore reproof, in which the Lord manifeſted much diſpleaſure. <hi>The Lord ſaid,</hi> openly and and angerly
<q>To Eliphaz the Temanite.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He ſpake not to <hi>Bildad,</hi> nor to <hi>Zophar,</hi> but to <hi>Eliphaz</hi> the <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manite.</hi> But why did the Lord direct his ſpeech to him perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, and by name, while the buſineſs concerned them all? I might anſwer as ſome do, becauſe what any one of them ſaid to <hi>Job,</hi> was as if ſaid by them all: And though their opinions differed, yet their perſons did not, all three agreeing in this (though upon ſeveral grounds) to oppoſe <hi>Job.</hi> And therefore the Lord in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to one, ſpake to them all.</p>
                  <pb n="857" facs="tcp:48669:442"/>
                  <p>But I ſhall give three other Reaſons for it, and from each a Note.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Eliphaz</hi> was the elder man, the graver perſon, as all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and therefore God reproved him perſonally.</p>
                  <p>Note this from it;
<q>The elder and greater any are, the greater is their offence, when they offend, though others offend with them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>When many are in a fault, the chiefs or heads of them are moſt faulty, and deſerve chiefly to hear of it. When <hi>Iſrael</hi> had committed that great ſin in <hi>Baal-peor (Numb.</hi> 25.4.) The Lord ſaid, <hi>Hang up the heads of the people before me,</hi> that is, the chiefs of the people. So, in proportion, when the Lord came to deal with theſe three, he fell upon <hi>Eliphaz</hi> firſt, as the more eminent or firſt of the three.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as <hi>Eliphaz</hi> was the elder or firſt of the three, ſo he began firſt with <hi>Job;</hi> he was not only the firſt and chief in perſon, but he was the firſt and chief ſpeaker.</p>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>They who are firſt in a fault, ſhall be firſt in reproof.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is dangerous to follow, or be a ſecond in a bad matter, but more, to begin and be leader.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Eliphaz</hi> was more ſharp with, and violent againſt <hi>Job,</hi> than the other two, and therefore the Lord began with him.</p>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>The deeper any are in a fault, of any kind, and the more of the heart appeareth in it, the worſe it is, the more blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy are they, and they ſhall be more blamed for it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>All the three friends of <hi>Job</hi> did much miſtake him, but the ſpirit of <hi>Eliphaz</hi> was hotteſt, therefore the Lord culled him out firſt. <hi>The Lord ſaid to</hi> Eliphaz <hi>the Temanite.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What ſaid the Lord?</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>My wrath is kindled againſt thee, and againſt thy two friends.</p>
                     <pb n="858" facs="tcp:48669:443"/>
                     <p>My wrath is kindled.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>Theſe words are uſed by <hi>Elihu</hi> (Chap. 32.2, 3.) <hi>Then was kindled the wrath of</hi> Elihu, <hi>the ſon of</hi> Barachel <hi>the</hi> Buzite; <hi>againſt</hi> Job <hi>was his wrath kindled, and againſt his three friends was his wrath kindled.</hi> Here the Lord taketh up the ſame words con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Eliphaz, My wrath is kindled againſt thee &amp; thy two friends. Elihu</hi>'s wrath was kindled, not only againſt <hi>Jobs</hi> friends, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Job</hi> himſelf; but the Lords wrath was kindled only againſt <hi>Jobs</hi> three friends, not againſt <hi>Job.</hi> He indeed diſpleaſed God, and was ſharply reproved by him; but the wrath of God was not kindled againſt him. 'Tis uſeful to conſider the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Gods judgement and mans, both as to things and perſons. <hi>Elihu</hi> thought <hi>Job</hi> was faulty as his friends, and therefore his wrath was kindled, as againſt his three friends, ſo againſt him too; but the Lord thought otherwiſe, and therefore ſaid to <hi>Eliphaz, My wrath is kindled againſt thee and thy two friends;</hi> he ſaid not ſo to <hi>Job.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, conſider the Lord ſpake much with <hi>Job,</hi> but he ſpake little with his friends, he did not vouchſafe them any long diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; and the words he ſpake to them, were very hot words; he in few words (as angry men uſe to do) told them their own.</p>
                  <p>Once more conſider, the difference of the Lords dealing with him and them. The Lord fetcht a great compaſs to reprove <hi>Job,</hi> as <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet did to reprove King <hi>David;</hi> but he told his friends at firſt word, <hi>My wrath is kindled againſt you.</hi> Though they were good men, yet not ſo dear to God as <hi>Job,</hi> and therefore he dealt in a more fatherly and favourable way with <hi>Job,</hi> than with them;<note place="margin">

                     </note> they had only hot words, <hi>My wrath is kindled againſt you,</hi> &amp;c. I am more than angry.

                  <p>The Latine words <hi>Ira</hi> and <hi>Iraſco,</hi> ſeem to be derived from it. The word is ſometimes applied to grief (there is a kind of fire in grief.) Thus 'tis ſaid (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.11.) <hi>It grieved</hi> Samuel, <hi>and
<pb n="859" facs="tcp:48669:443"/> he cryed unto the Lord all night. Samuel</hi> was vehemently grieved, becau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <q>My wrath <hi>(ſaith the Lord)</hi> is kindled.</q>
                  <p>There is a wrath of God, which is not kindled, as I may ſay, it is not blown up, 'tis covered in the aſhes of his patience and forbearance; but here, ſaith God, <hi>My wrath is kindled.</hi> This is ſpoken by God after the manner of men. God feels no change by wrath or anger, no impreſſion is made on him by any paſſion: Wrath in God, notes only his change of diſpenſations towards man, not any in himſelf. When he acts like a man whoſe wrath is greatly kindled, then 'tis ſaid, his wrath is kindled; as when he acteth like a man that ſheweth much love, it may be ſaid, his love is kindled.</p>
                  <p>Further, when God ſaith, <hi>My wrath is kindled,</hi> it implieth there is ſome great provocation given him by man, as in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent caſe <hi>Eliphaz</hi> and his two friends had done. The Lord threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a ſinful Land with <hi>brimſtone, and ſalt, and burning, like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah; and,</hi> this being executed, <hi>all Nations ſhall ſay, wherefore hath the Lord done thus unto this Land? what meaneth the heat of this great anger? Then men ſhall ſay, becauſe they have forſaken the Covenant of the Lord God of their Fathers,</hi> &amp;c. (<hi>Deut.</hi> 29.23, 24, 25.) The wrath of God is never kindled till blown, and that which bloweth it up is mans ſin; nor doth the ordinary ſins of man kindle the wrath of God, for then it muſt be alwayes kindled, even againſt the beſt of men. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, when the Lord ſaid in the Text to <hi>Eliphaz, My wrath is kindled againſt thee and thy two friends,</hi> there was ſomewhat ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary in their ſin, which kindled it; and therefore the Lord directed them an extraordinary way (as to circumſtances) for the querching of it, and the making of their peace.</p>
                  <p>But here it may be queſtioned, why did the Lord ſay his wrath was kindled only againſt <hi>Eliphaz</hi> and his two friends? had he no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſay againſt <hi>Elihu?</hi> he had ſpoken as harſhly to <hi>Job</hi> as any of them, yet <hi>Elihu</hi> was not at all reproved, much leſs was the wrath of God kindled againſt him.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, 'Tis true, <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpake very hard words of <hi>Job;</hi> yet we may ſay four things of <hi>Elihu,</hi> which might exempt him from
<pb n="860" facs="tcp:48669:444"/> this blame which fell upon thoſe three.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, He did not ſpeak with, nor diſcover a bitter ſpirit, as they did.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Elihu</hi> objected not againſt <hi>Job</hi> his former life, nor charged him as having done wickedly towards man, or hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically towards God; he only condemned him for preſent miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages under his trouble, for impatience and unquietneſs of ſpirit under the croſs.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That which <hi>Elihu</hi> chiefly objected againſt <hi>Job</hi> was, <hi>the juſtifying of himſelf rather than God</hi> (as he ſpeaks at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the 32d. Chapter) not the maintaining of his own innocency, nor the juſtifying of himſelf before men. Indeed <hi>Job</hi> failed while he inſiſted ſo much upon that point, that he ſeemed more careful to clear himſelf, than to juſtifie God.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, When <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpake hardly, it was more out of a true zeal to defend the juſtice of God in afflicting him, than to tax him with injuſtice. Now becauſe <hi>Elihu</hi> did not carry it with a bitter ſpirit, and hit the mark much better than his friends (though in ſome things he alſo ſhot wide and miſunderſtood <hi>Job</hi>) therefore the blame fell only upon <hi>Jobs</hi> three friends, and not upon <hi>Elihu; The Lord ſaid to</hi> Eliphaz, <hi>my wrath is kindled againſt thee, and againſt thy two friends;</hi> but his wrath went no further.</p>
                  <p>Hence note, Firſt;
<q>The Lord knows how to declare wrath as well as love, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure as well as favour.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He hath a ſtore of wrath as well as of love, and that is kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led when he is highly diſpleaſed.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Note;
<q>Sin cauſeth kindlings or diſcoveries of divine wrath.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Had it not been for ſin, the Lord had never declared any wrath in the world, nothing had gone out from him but kindneſs and love, favours and mercies. <hi>Wrath is revealed from heaven againſt all unrighteouſneſs, and againſt unrighteouſneſs only (Rom.</hi> 1.18.) Unrighteouſneſs kindleth wrath, <hi>ſin is</hi> the <hi>kindle-coal.</hi> When we ſee wrath or diſpleaſure going out, we may conclude ſin is gone out. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid to <hi>Aaron (Numb.</hi> 16.46.) <hi>Take a Cenſer, and
<pb n="861" facs="tcp:48669:444"/> put fire therein from off the altar, and put on incenſe, and go quickly unto the congregation, and make an atonement for them, for there is wrath gone out from the Lord, the plague is begun.</hi> Now as in this latter part of the chapter, <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhews that wrath was gone out againſt that people from the Lord; ſo in the former part of it he ſhews, that ſin, and that a great ſin, was gone out from that people againſt the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Note;
<q>The Lord ſometimes declareth wrath, even againſt thoſe whom he loveth.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wrath may fall upon good men; ſuch were theſe friends of <hi>Job.</hi> All the Elect, whileſt they remain unconverted or uncalled, are called <hi>Children of wrath</hi> (Epheſ. 2.3.) Though they are in the everlaſting love of God, yet they are children of wrath, as to their preſent condition, whilſt in a ſtate of nature and unreconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to God. Now, as the children of God, are children of wrath, before their converſion; ſo, when any great ſin is committed after converſion, they are in ſome ſenſe under wrath; and the Lord declareth wrath againſt them, till the breach be healed, and their peace ſued out. It is dangerous continuing for a moment in any ſin unrepented of, or we not going unto God by Jeſus Chriſt for pardon. When once the wrath of God is kindled, how far it may burn, who knoweth? There is no ſafety under guilt; <hi>Therefore kiſs the ſon leſt he be angry, and ye periſh from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little: bleſſed are they that put their truſt in him</hi> (Pſal. 2.12.) <hi>My wrath is kindled againſt thee, and thy two friends.</hi> Why?</p>
                  <q>Becauſe ye have not ſpoken that which is right of me.</q>
                  <p>Hence note, Fourthly;
<q>When the Lord is angry he will ſhew cauſe of his anger.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>God is not angry (as men often are) without cauſe. When <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi> was angry, the Lord ſaid unto him, <hi>Doſt thou well to be angry?</hi> Yea, ſaith he, that I do, I have reaſon enough (thought he) to be angry, though there was no true reaſon at all for it. But when the Lord is angry, he always hath reaſon enough, and he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times giveth his reaſon. That the Lord doth us good, is from free
<pb n="862" facs="tcp:48669:445"/> grace: there is no reaſon in us, why he doth us good; as he told the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> I did this, and that for you, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ye were more than others (either in weight or number) but becauſe I loved you: but when the Lord afflicts his people, he tells them the reaſon, 'tis for your ſins, or to purge you from your ſins; and ſometimes pointeth them to the ſpecial ſins, for which he puniſheth them, and from which he would have them purged. As here he did <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> and his two friends.</p>
                  <q>Ye have not ſpoken of me the thing that is right, as my ſervant <hi>Job</hi> hath.</q>
                  <p>The Lord doth not charge them with any evil actings, but with undue ſpeakings; <hi>Ye have not ſpoken of me the thing that is right.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>Failings in ſpeech, or in what we ſay, may kindle wrath, as well as failings in what we do.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Further, The Lord doth not charge them with ſpeaking ſoul and filthy things, they had only ſpoken <hi>the thing that was not right. A little failing in ſpeech, or in what we ſay concerning God and his ways, may kindle wrath.</hi>
                  </p>

Hence the Septuagint render, <hi>ye have not ſpoken before me the thing that is right:</hi> As if God had ſaid, all that ye have ſpoken hath been in my preſence, I being witneſs, yea, I being Judge; yet ye ſpake not right. Did we remember that whatſoever we ſpeak, as well as whatſoever we do, is before God, and muſt come under his judgment, we would be more careful both to do and to ſpeak (which theſe men did not) <hi>the thing that is right.

Our tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation refers to the matter; <hi>ye have not ſpoken of me the thing that is right.</hi> Yet they failed (as the word implieth) in their manner of ſpeaking alſo; they handled Gods cauſe unhandſomely, they ſpake not as they ought, as well as what they ought not, to a poor afflicted creature; they ſpake not with that tenderneſs, pity, and compaſſionateneſs as became them, to a man in that pitiful caſe.</p>
                  <p>But though the Lord might ſay in both theſe ſenſes, <hi>Ye have not ſpoken of me the thing that is right,</hi> yet he ſaid not (as the Septuagint over-raſhly render) <hi>Ye have not ſpoken of me any thing that is right;</hi> nor doth the Lord charge them abſolutely, as not ſpeaking right of him, but with a modification, or comparatively, <hi>Ye have not ſpoken of me the thing that is right,</hi>
                     <q>As my ſervant <hi>Job</hi> hath.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>As if he had ſaid, <hi>Job</hi> hath been condemned by you, and yet <hi>Job</hi> hath ſpoken better than you, righter than you; though he hath had his failings in ſpeaking, yet ye have failed more than he.</p>
                  <p>But it may be queſtioned, what was it that they did not ſpeak right, and what was it that <hi>Job</hi> ſpake righter than they.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, They had not ſpoken ſo right as he,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, About the doctrine of Gods providence, by which he governs all things, and diſtributes good and evil, that is, proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and adverſity, to the ſons of men.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, They had not ſpoken ſo right as he, taking up the ſigns or tokens of the love and hatred of God from his outward diſpenſations.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, They cenſured <hi>Job</hi> as a ſinful doer in former times, and that now his ſin had found him out, becauſe at that time he was ſo great a ſufferer. Theſe things were not right.</p>
                  <p>Or thus, <hi>Jobs</hi> friends did not ſpeak right.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, In judging that God was angry with him, becauſe he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Nor did they ſpeak right in judging <hi>Job</hi> wicked, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe afflicted; they ſpake many right things about the juſtice and
<pb n="864" facs="tcp:48669:446"/> power of God, but they did not hit <hi>Jobs</hi> caſe right: They thought and concluded, that if <hi>Job</hi> had not been a great ſinner, God would not have afflicted him at all, at leaſt, not ſo greatly: They ſuppoſed God could not juſtly afflict <hi>Job</hi> as he had done, had <hi>Job</hi> been a juſt man. This was not right; they did not well conſider, Firſt, That God may afflict a juſt man out of Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Secondly, They did not well conſider, that God hath other ends and reaſons in afflicting than for iniquity; and therefore they knew not how to juſtifie the proceedings of God, but by condemning <hi>Job,</hi> which there was no neceſſity to do. So then, their great errour and miſtake was in reſolving this queſtion affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matively, <hi>Whether he that is greatly afflicted, be a great ſinner?</hi> or <hi>whether the ſevere judgments of God light only upon ungodly men?</hi> Their affimation of this, was enough to make <hi>Job</hi> deſpair, and did provoke him to utter ſeveral very paſſionate and unfitting ſpeeches.</p>
                  <p>For though <hi>Job</hi> ſpake many things right, yet not all right. God judged him according to the tendency and ſcope of his ſpirit and ſpeech, not according to the accidents and ſuddein extravagancies of either. <hi>Job</hi> ſpake right,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, In affirming conſtantly, that God did not afflict him for his ſin.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That his afflictions were no ſigns of Gods diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure againſt him, nor of his wickedneſs againſt God. Yet <hi>Job</hi> did not ſpeak all nor always right: He failed,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, When he ſpake impatiently of his own ſufferings.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, When he ſpake ſo boldly to God, asking (as it were) an account of his doings and dealings with him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, He ſpake not right (though that was right which he ſpake) when he ſpake ſo much of his own righteouſneſs, thereby (though not purpoſely, yet) according to the apprehenſion of others, reflecting upon the righteouſneſs of God. In theſe things and more (which have been noted in opening this book) <hi>Job</hi> ſpake not right of God; yet righter than <hi>Eliphaz</hi> and his two friends, and therefore the Lord told them, <hi>Ye have not ſpoken of me the thing that is right, as my ſervant</hi> Job <hi>hath.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Further, To anſwer the queſtion, and to clear the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, we muſt take notice.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, In what <hi>Job,</hi> and his three friends agreed.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, In what they diſagreed.</p>
                  <pb n="865" facs="tcp:48669:446"/>
                  <p>They all agreed, firſt, in This, that all the afflictions which befal man in this life, fall within the ſight and certain knowledge of God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they all agreed, That God is the author and effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cauſe, the orderer and diſpoſer of all the afflictions that befal man.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, they all agree, That God neither doth, nor can do wrong to any man, whatſoever affliction he layeth upon him, or how long ſoever he continueth it upon him. Thus far they all ſpake right things, and agreed in what they ſpake.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Jobs</hi> friends held other opinions, wherein he totally diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from them.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That, <hi>whoſoever is good, and doth good, ſhall receive a preſent good reward.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, That <hi>whoſoever is evil, and doth evil, ſhall receive preſent puniſhment.</hi> So that, if any wicked man proſper, it is but for a while, ſudden miſchief will overtake him: And if any god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man be afflicted, it is but for a while, his affliction will ſoon end, and he return to a flouriſhing condition in this life. From theſe premiſes they concluded, that whoſoever is afflicted, and continueth long under affliction, certainly that man is wicked, and thereupon they judged <hi>Job</hi> to be ſuch a one.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Job</hi> held this right poſition againſt them all, <hi>That the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God diſpenceth outward good and evil ſo indifferently</hi> to good and bad men, that no unerring judgment can poſſibly be made of any mans ſpiritual ſtate, by his outſide or temporal ſtate: This <hi>Job</hi> ſtuck cloſe to, as was ſhewed more fully in the Preface to the Second Part.</p>
                  <p>I conclude then, That neither did <hi>Eliphaz</hi> and his two friends, fail ſo much in ſpeaking, as to ſpeak nothing right of God (yea, there was ſomewhat right in every thing they ſpake of God) nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did <hi>Job</hi> ſpeak ſo right, as to ſpeak nothing amiſs of God. Now God, who knew exactly who ſpake righteſt, determined the matter for <hi>Job: Ye have not ſpoken of me the thing that is right, as my ſervant</hi> Job <hi>hath.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet before I paſs from theſe words, it may be queſtioned, and ſome make it a great queſtion, <hi>Whether we are to underſtand this ſentence and determination of God (preferring what</hi> Job <hi>had ſpoken of him, before what</hi> Eliphaz <hi>and his two friends had ſpoken of him)
<pb n="866" facs="tcp:48669:447"/> in reference to all that</hi> Job <hi>had ſpoken of him, in way of aſſertion, throughout the whole diſpute, when his ſoul was heated and grieved; or, of what he ſpake towards the latter end, in a cooler temper, when his ſoul was humbled?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Jewiſh Doctors (who for the moſt part are very ſevere againſt, and cenſorious of <hi>Job</hi>) expound this ſentence of God, as if it reſpected only what <hi>Job</hi> ſpake at the beginning of the 40th chapter (<hi>ver.</hi> 3, 4, 5.) <hi>Then</hi> Job <hi>anſwered the Lord, and ſaid, behold, I am vile, what ſhall I anſwer thee? Once have I ſpoken, but I will not anſwer; yea, twice, but I will proceed no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> And what he ſpake at the 42d chapter (<hi>ver.</hi> 1, 2.) <hi>Then</hi> Job <hi>anſwered the Lord, and ſaid, I know that thou canſt do every thing, and that no thought can be with-holden from thee,</hi> &amp;c. Concluding (<hi>ver.</hi> 6.) <hi>Wherefore I abhor my ſelf, and repent in duſt and aſhes.</hi> In theſe places, ſay they, <hi>Job</hi> ſpake righter than his friends, but not ſo in the whole body of his diſcourſe. Some others poſſibly have concurred (though I have ſeen but one, and him only in Manuſcript) with the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> in this cenſure; affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that <hi>Jobs</hi> opinion was the worſt of all the four, yea, that it was little leſs than blaſphemy, taking men off from, at leaſt, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging them in ways of godlineſs, while he affirmed peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily (<hi>chap.</hi> 9.22, 23.) <hi>He</hi> (that is, God) <hi>deſtroyeth the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and the wicked: if the ſcourge ſtay ſuddenly, he laugheth at the tryal of the innocent.</hi> This aſſertion of his concerning God (and of this, his whole diſcourſe with his three friends ſavoured) was not (ſay they) ſo right as theirs: and therefore they reſtrain thoſe words of God, <hi>Ye have not ſpoken of me the thing that is right, as my ſervant</hi> Job, to what <hi>Job</hi> ſpake in the chapters men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, when he was upon his repentance; but will not allow them to reach to, or be meant of what he ſpake of God, in the courſe of his former diſpute with his friends.</p>
                  <p>But I ſhall cloſe and joyn with thoſe, who refer the words of this final judgment which God gave upon this matter, to what <hi>Job</hi> ſpake of God from firſt to laſt; and that they are not to be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited to what <hi>Job</hi> ſpake after God had humbled him, by ſpeaking to him out of the whirlwind.</p>
                  <p>I grant (as hath been ſaid) <hi>Job</hi> ſpake unduely more than once, in the days of his anguiſh and ſore affliction; for which <hi>Elihu</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved him ſharply (<hi>chap.</hi> 34, <hi>ver.</hi> 35, 36, 37. <hi>chap.</hi> 35.16.)
<pb n="867" facs="tcp:48669:447"/> And ſo did God himſelf (<hi>chap.</hi> 38.2. <hi>chap.</hi> 40.1, 2, 8.) Nor did <hi>Job</hi> in the iſſue ſpare, much leſs flatter himſelf, as if he had ſpoken nothing amiſs, but humbly confeſſed his error and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in ſpeaking (<hi>chap.</hi> 40.4, 5. <hi>chap.</hi> 42.3, and 6.) <hi>Wherefore I abhor my ſelf, and repent,</hi> &amp;c. even, becauſe in the extremity of my pains, I ſpake ſo unadviſedly with my lips.</p>
                  <p>I grant alſo, that <hi>Job</hi> ſpake much more rightly, or righteſt of God, after God had humbled him and brought down his ſpirit by that dreadful diſpenſation out of the whirlwind.</p>
                  <p>Yet, I ſay, <hi>Job</hi> ſpake more rightly of God during his affliction, than <hi>Eliphaz</hi> and his two friends had done; which, as it may appear by that brief account or ſurvey of their opinions a little before given, ſo I ſhall adde ſomewhat more towards the making of it yet more apparent.</p>
                  <p>For, Firſt, That aſſertion laid down (<hi>chap.</hi> 9.22, 23.) <hi>He deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the perfect and the wicked,</hi> &amp;c. which hath raiſed ſo much duſt, and is judged by ſome as a quench-coal to all piety and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; and which occaſion'd the Jewiſh Writers to ſay, that <hi>Job</hi> ſought to turn the charger the bottome upward; that his mouth was full of gravel, that he began his ſpeech with curſing, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued it with blaſpheming: That aſſertion, I ſay, is no more than <hi>Solomon</hi> hath given us (<hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.1, 2.) <hi>All things come alike to all; and there is one event to the righteous and the wicked.</hi> Now <hi>Job</hi> ſpake this in his firſt anſwer to <hi>Bildad,</hi> which was almoſt at the beginning of the diſpute.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Job</hi> ſpake altogether right of God, and of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence towards himſelf and others all along; while he conſtantly maintained, Firſt, That he was not afflicted for any wickedneſs committed by him, in the former paſſages of his life. Secondly, That outward good is not always the portion of the good, nor out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward evil the portion of evil men always in this life. Thirdly, That God is not unrighteous, though he exerciſe the righteous with grievous troubles all their days, and heap worldly bleſſings upon the wicked all the days of this life. Fourthly, That we are not to take meaſure of, nor eſtimate the goodneſs or badneſs of any mans perſon, by the good or bad days which paſs over his head in this life. Fifthly, That no mans happineſs or unhappineſs, is to be judged by what befals him in this life. <hi>Job</hi> ſpake right, and righter of God than <hi>Eliphaz</hi> and his two friends, in all theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.
<pb n="868" facs="tcp:48669:448"/> And whereas he ſometimes acted impatiently, and ſpake uncomely, blotting a good cauſe with paſſionate and haſty words, ſuch as ignorant and evil men might make an ill uſe of, and draw to the patronage of their prophanity; theſe proceeded not out of the abundance of his heart, but from the abundance of his pains under the heavy hand of God. And when he ſeemed to tax the judgment of God, it was not any affirmation that God was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt or unequal in it; but an expoſtulation with him about it, or, as ſome expreſs it, a confeſſion of his own ignorance, and an earneſt deſire of clearer light and better information concerning the way of it.</p>
                  <p>But if we conſider the ſum of what <hi>Eliphaz</hi> and his two friends ſpake of God; we ſhall find <hi>Eliphaz</hi> in this great miſtake, affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that all the ſufferings and afflictions which befal man in this world, are laid upon him by God as a puniſhment for ſin. And all three joyned in two other miſtakes. Firſt, That all wicked men, ſooner or later, are viſibly puniſhed for their ſin in this life. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, That though a good man may poſſibly ſuffer grievous af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions in this life, yet God always delivers him out of them, before he departs this life. Hence it muſt needs follow, that if a man for long continuance of time, eſpecially, if all his life long he continue in great calamity, that man muſt be judged wicked, though no apparant wickedneſs can be charged upon him, nor proved againſt him. Upon theſe unſound principles, they were all confident to infer againſt <hi>Job,</hi> that he was an hypocrite, and that all thoſe troubles which befel him, were inflicted by the righteous hand of God as a puniſhment for his ſin.</p>
                  <p>Now if this be the ſum of what they ſpake, we have reaſon enough to anſwer the queſtion propoſed, That the Lords deciſive ſentence between <hi>Job</hi> and his friends, reſpecteth what <hi>Job</hi> ſpake of or to God, throughout the book, and is not to be underſtood only of what he ſpake towards the cloſe of it; <hi>Ye have not ſpoken of me the thing that is right,</hi>
                     <q>As my ſervant <hi>Job</hi> hath.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are two parts of a Judges office. Firſt, To condemn the guilty. Secondly, To acquit the innocent. God the great Judge doth both here; the firſt, in the former words; the ſecond, in theſe: Yea, the Lord doth not only acquit, but own <hi>Job</hi> in the
<pb n="869" facs="tcp:48669:448"/> cloſe of all, <hi>as his ſervant.</hi> The Lord ſaid to Satan in the firſt chapter, <hi>Haſt thou conſidered my ſervant</hi> Job; and here he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes (after Satan had done his worſt to make <hi>Job</hi> quit the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God) in the ſame ſtile, <hi>my ſervant</hi> Job; as if the Lord had ſaid, Job <hi>ſhall wear my livery ſtill, he is my ſervant ſtill.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Several uſeful obſervations iſſue from this latter part of the verſe, which I ſhall briefly hint.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Who were theſe that had not ſpoken aright? they were wiſe, grave, and learned men, yea, they were godly men too.</p>
                  <p>Hence note,
<q>Wiſe, learned, and good men may err.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>They may err in judgment, and in ſpeech. <hi>Jobs</hi> friends ſpake many truths, but did not apply them truly to <hi>Jobs</hi> caſe. The beſt men may not only miſs, but miſtake their mark. They who are in the light, yea, who are light in the Lord, have yet ſome dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in them, and may both do and ſpeak from that darkneſs (ſuch was the caſe of theſe men in the text.) <hi>David</hi> may be underſtood of good men, in a degree, as well as of bad men, when he ſaid (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 62.9.) <hi>Men of low degree are vanity, and men of high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree are a lie:</hi> they are ſo, both actively and paſſively; they may be deceived, and they may deceive. As when the Lord of old <hi>heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened and heard, they</hi> (that is, all wicked men) <hi>ſpake not aright, no man repented of his wickedneſs, ſaying, what have I done?</hi> (Jer. 8.6.) So when the Lord hearkens and hears at this day, they, that is, all good men, ſpeak not aright in all things, neither of him, nor of what he hath done.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Conſider who it was that God vindicated in this matter? It was his ſervant <hi>Job.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>God will ſooner or later, one time or other, vindicate the credit of his faithful ſervants.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He will (as we ſpeak proverbially) <hi>ſet the ſaddle upon the right horſe;</hi> and make it appear before men and angels, who have done and ſpoken right, yea, who righteſt. Let patience under ſufferance have its perfect work, for God will give a perfect judgment of every mans word and work (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.6.)</p>
                  <pb n="870" facs="tcp:48669:449"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, Note;
<q>The Lords knowledge is infinite and unerring.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He knoweth who hath the better, who is in the right: He could tell <hi>Eliphaz</hi> and his two friends, that though they had ſpoken ſome things right, yet not all, nor ſo right as <hi>Job.</hi> The Lord (as we ſay) can cleave a hair in any controverſie, and tell every one where he is out, whether in opinion or practiſe. <hi>God is light, and in him is no darkneſs at all</hi> (1 <hi>John.</hi> 1.5.) Our light is but little, and 'tis mingled with much darkneſs; our light is dark, and will be ſo, till we come to that inheritance among the Saints in light. But Gods light is all light, altogether light, both concerning things and perſons.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, What <hi>Eliphaz</hi> and his friends ſpake, that was not right, concerned <hi>Job</hi> immediately; they ſpake very glorious things of God out of his caſe: yet the Lord ſaith not, <hi>Ye have not ſpoken of</hi> Job <hi>the thing that is right,</hi> but, <hi>Ye have not ſpoken of me the thing that is right.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>God takes himſelf concerned in what is ſpoken amiſs, of or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his ſervants.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jobs</hi> friends looked upon themſelves as ſtrong witneſſes, yea, as great Advocates for God; and doubtleſs, they intended no leſs than a plea for God, in what they ſpake to and againſt <hi>Job:</hi> yet becauſe they in many things grieved, and in ſome things wronged his ſervant <hi>Job,</hi> therefore ſaith God, <hi>ye have not ſpoken of me the thing that is right.</hi> The Lord will ſay, in the great day, to the wicked, about their neglects of duty to his faithful ones, <hi>In-as-much as ye did it not to one of the leaſt of theſe, ye did it not to me (Mat.</hi> 25.45.) In-as-much as ye have not fed and cloathed theſe, ye have not fed nor cloathed me. Now, as the Lord taketh all the neglects of good to his people, to himſelf; ſo the Lord taketh all that evil which any ſpeak of his people, to himſelf: <hi>He</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>that ſpeaketh amiſs of mine, ſpeaketh amiſs of me.</hi> The Lord accounteth himſelf intereſted in all that good or evil, which is done and ſpoken to his people; and he is very angry when any thing is miſ-ſpoken of, or miſapplied to them, though with reſpect to himſelf, or as a ſervice unto himſelf.</p>
                  <pb n="871" facs="tcp:48669:449"/>
                  <p>Fifthly, Conſider, <hi>Jobs</hi> friends ſpake many excellent truths; yet ſaith the Lord, <hi>ye have not ſpoken of me the thing that is right, as my ſervant</hi> Job <hi>hath.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>The Lord is greatly diſpleaſed, when truth, or that which is right in it ſelf, is wrong applied.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jobs</hi> friends were moſtly right in their Doctrine, but often out in their Uſes; all their open aſſertions had ſome truth in them, but ſo had not all their ſecret Inferences. God will not bear it, to have truths put to any ill uſe, eſpecially this, to grieve and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage any of his ſuffering ſervants. To ſpeak of the holineſs, juſtice and righteouſneſs of God, ſo as to terrifie an afflicted ſoul, is to make a bad improvement of the beſt things: 'Tis a fly in the box of ointment. <hi>Dead flies</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Eccleſ. 10.1.) <hi>cauſe the ointment of the Apothecary to ſend forth a ſtinking ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; ſo doth a little folly him that is in reputation for wiſdom and honour. Jobs</hi> friends were in reputation for wiſdom and honour; yet this little folly ſent forth an ill ſavour in the Lords noſtrils, and cauſed him to ſay, <hi>Ye have not ſpoken of me the thing that is right.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>Jobs</hi> friends certainly meant well, and had a zeal for God; yet God was angry, and ſaid, they had not ſpoken right.</p>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>Our good intentions, yea, zeal for God, will not bear us out when we do or ſpeak amiſs.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe men had a zeal for God, elſe <hi>Job</hi> had not ſaid as once he did, <hi>Will ye lye for God?</hi> Though they did not knowingly ſpeak a lye, yet a lye was in what they ſpake; and therefore their ſpeaking for God would not bear them out.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, The Lord ſaid to <hi>Jobs</hi> friends, <hi>Ye have not ſpoken of me the thing that is right, as my ſervant</hi> Job <hi>hath.</hi> Though <hi>Job</hi> ſpake ſome things amiſs, yet the Lord did not charge him with them, as he did his friends.</p>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>The Lord over-looketh many failings, and will not upbraid his ſervants with them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="872" facs="tcp:48669:450"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Job</hi> had his failings; but the Lord took no notice of them, but made a determination in his caſe, as if he had ſpoken right in all things. The Lord will not flatter his ſervants when they fail, yet he is very favourable to them, even when they fail; he told <hi>Job</hi> plainly enough, that he had darkned counſel by words with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowledge, while he asked him, who did it? (Chap. 38.2.) He intimated alſo, that <hi>Job</hi> had contended with him, and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him, that he had (conſequentially) attempted to diſannul his Judgement, and condemn him (Chap. 40.2, 8.) yet here when the Lord came to make up the matter between <hi>Job</hi> and his friends, he ſpake as if he had forgot both his own cenſures of him, and the occaſion of them. Holy <hi>David</hi> acknowledged (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 130.3.) <hi>If thou Lord ſhouldſt mark iniquities, O Lord, who ſhall ſtand!</hi> The Lord doth not mark iniquity where he ſeeth much integrity; the Lord doth not mark every arrow that flies beſide the mark, when he ſeeth the mark was honeſtly aimed at. We ſay, he may be a good Archer that doth not hit the white, if he come but ſomewhat near it; he indeed is a bungler that miſſeth the Butt. <hi>Job</hi> aimed at, and came neer the mark, though he did not alwayes hit it. The Lord will give a good teſtimony of us, if we aim right at, though we ſometimes miſs the mark. It is ſaid of <hi>Zachariah</hi> and <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth (Luke</hi> 1.6.) <hi>They were both righteous.</hi> There's not a word ſpoken of their failings, though doubtleſs they had their failings, both as to the Ordinances and Commandements of God.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, The Lords wrath being kindled againſt <hi>Jobs</hi> friends, we might expect he would thunder upon them; yet he only ſaith, <hi>Ye have not ſpoken of me the thing that is right.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence obſerve;
<q>The Lord dealeth mildly with ſinners.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He did not give wrathful words, though his wrath was kindled; he did not call <hi>Eliphaz</hi> and his friends Hereticks, nor tell them they had belyed him, and ſlandered his proceedings; he did not aggravate their fault by grievous words, he did not upbraid them <hi>particularly:</hi> but, without bitterneſs or hard reflections, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended their all faults in one <hi>general</hi> ſoft word, <hi>Ye have not ſpoken of me the thing that is right.</hi> This ſhould be our pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern in dealing with an offending brother: whereas many, if a
<pb n="873" facs="tcp:48669:450"/> brother do but differ from them a little, if he do not ſay as they ſay, and concur with them fully in opinion, are ready to cenſure him hardly, and give him reproachful language. The Apoſtles rule is (<hi>Gal.</hi> 6.1.) <hi>Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye that are ſpiritual reſtore ſuch a one in the ſpirit of meekneſs, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering thy ſelf, leſt thou alſo be tempted.</hi> God who is above all temptation, meekly reſtored theſe faulty men; yea, though his wrath was kindled againſt them, yet his ſpeech was mild and cool, only ſaying (and what leſs could he ſay, if he ſaid any thing) <hi>Ye have not ſpoken of me the thing that is right,</hi>
                     <q>As my ſervant <hi>Job.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Why doth the Lord call <hi>Job</hi> his ſervant? Surely at once to put an honour upon him, and to comfort him. <hi>Eliphaz</hi> and his two friends were Gods ſervants; yet becauſe of their miſcarriage in that ſervice, God did not own them at that time as ſuch. God was wont to call <hi>David</hi> his ſervant at every turn; yet when he had numbred the people, <hi>Nathan</hi> was ſent to him with a hard meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, and is bid, <hi>Go, and ſay unto David,</hi> not, my ſervant <hi>David</hi> (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.12.)</p>
                  <p>Hence note, Ninthly;
<q>God honours man much, by owning him as his ſervant.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>To ſerve the Lord, is as much our priviledge as our duty; and when the Lord calleth us to his ſervice, he rather puts a favour up-us, than a burden. The Lord is the higheſt maſter, and they are highly honoured who are his ſervants. It is an honour to ſerve Kings and Princes: what is it then to ſerve the King of Kings, the Prince of the Kings of the earth! as Jeſus Chriſt is called (<hi>Rev.</hi> 1.5.) 'Tis alſo profitable as well as honourable, to ſerve the Lord; for he is the beſt maſter, his work is the beſt wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>k, and his wages is the beſt wages. And not only ſo, but 'tis eaſie to be the Lords ſervant; for as he expects we ſhould do his work, ſo we may expect help and ſtrength, hearts and hands from him to do it. If the Lord doth but own us for his ſervants, we ſhall not faint at his work, whether it be doing or ſuffering work. God upheld his ſervant <hi>Job</hi> in, and carryed him through all thoſe try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als and troubles, which would have ſunk him a thouſand times, had not he ſtood by him and aſſiſted him. The Lord is a maſter
<pb n="874" facs="tcp:48669:451"/> in Covenant with his ſervants, and that a Covenant of grace, in which every command hath a promiſe annexed to it; and that not only a promiſe of reward, when we have done it, but of ſtrength to do it: and if ſo, then we may conclude it eaſie as well as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable and profitable, to ſerve the Lord. Therefore</p>
                  <p>Let us labour to approve our ſelves the Lords ſervants. And if any ask, who is the Lords ſervant? I anſwer,</p>
                  <p>Fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſt, He is the Lords ſervant that doth the Lords work; <hi>His ſervants we are, whom we obey;</hi> he is our maſter whoſe work we do. It is good for us to conſider whoſe work we are about. Jeſus Chriſt was the fathers ſervant in that great undertaking, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of loſt man. Now, all his work on earth was his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers work (<hi>John</hi> 9.4.) <hi>I</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>must work the work of him that ſent me.</hi> Unleſs we are in the Lords work, and doing the Lords will, we cannot be reckoned among his ſervants.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If you are the Lords ſervants, then as you do the Lords work, ſo you are ready to do all his work. He is not a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant that doth what he pleaſeth. Some ſay, they will do the Lords work, but they pick and chuſe, they do this, and leave the other undone: He is the Lords ſervant, that goeth through all the Lords work. If we do eaſie work, and refuſe hard work; if we refuſe that work which diſpleaſeth the world, and chuſe only that which is pleaſing to the world, we ſerve not the Lord, but the world and our ſelves. Here is the tryal, when we do what God willeth, whether the world will it, and like it, yea, or no. The Lord ſaid of <hi>David, He is my ſervant</hi> (and what will he do?) <hi>he will do all my will;</hi> that is, he will not ſtick at any of my work.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If ye are the Lords ſervants, as ye will do all his work, ſo no wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>k but his; you will not do the work of the fleſh, you will not do any work for man, in oppoſition to the work of God. In ſubordination to the will of God, we ſhould readily do the work of man. In ſerving men thus, we are alſo the ſervants of God. But he that is the Lords ſervant, will not do any work for man which contradicteth or croſſeth the ſervice of God. Chriſt ſaith expreſly, <hi>No man ſerveth two Maſters; ye cannot ſerve God and Mammon (Mat.</hi> 6.24.) We may ſerve many Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, if they command the ſame thing, or things ſubordinate; but we cannot ſerve two Maſters if their commands interfere and claſh one with the other, as the work of God and Mammon doth.
<pb n="875" facs="tcp:48669:451"/> And thus the Apoſtles caution is to be underſtood (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.23.) <hi>Ye are bought with a price: be not ye the ſervants of men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, If ye are the Lords ſervants, as ye do the Lords work, and all his work, and only his work, ſo ye will do his work willingly. All the Lords ſervants are free men, his ſervants are ſons; they do not ſerve as ſlaves, but as children; and God dealeth with them as a Father, more than as a Maſter. Conſider, have ye a free ſpirit for the ſervice of God? His ſervants find themſelves indeed conſtrained to ſerve him, but they do not ſerve him by conſtraint; they are conſtrained by love, not by baſe fear to ſerve him.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, If ye are the Lords ſervants, ye do his work for his ſake; the will of the Lord is as much the reaſon why ye do his work, as the rule by which ye do it. Should we do never ſo much of that which is materially the Lords work, unleſs we do it becauſe it is his work, we are not his ſervants in doing it. He that doth the Lords work for ſelf-ends only or chiefly, is not the Lords ſervant, but his own.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, If ye are the Lords ſervants, ye have reſolved to be his ſervants for ever; your ears are bored at his poſt, and ye have have ſaid (as the ſervant under the Law that loved his Maſter, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.5, 6.) <hi>Ye will not go out free.</hi> It was ſo with <hi>Job;</hi> he was the Lords ſervant before his rrouble, and he was ſo at the end of his troubles. The Lord doth not take ſervants for months and for years; we muſt be his everlaſting ſervants, alwayes his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, if his ſervants at all. And this ſhould rejoyce our ſouls, that we are and ſhall be for ever in the Lords work. To ſerve the Lord, is better than to rule the world. God is ſo good a Maſter, that we ſhall never have any, the leaſt, occaſion to deſire a change; and he is ſo ſure a Maſter, that we need not fear it.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Though the Lord ſaid, his wrath was kindled againſt <hi>Eliphaz</hi> and his two friends, yet in the very next words he is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting them how to make their peace, and return, or be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved again into his favour.</p>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>God often manifeſts more diſpleaſure, than ever he intends to act.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yea, when ever he manifeſts diſpleaſure againſt his children,
<pb n="876" facs="tcp:48669:452"/> it is that he might not act it. <hi>Nineveh</hi> was threatned with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, that repenting it might not be deſtroyed. Sinners of all ſorts are threatned with death and damnation, that believing, they may be ſaved and live. What could <hi>Eliphaz</hi> and his two friends expect, when the Lord ſaid, <hi>My wrath is kindled,</hi> but that his wrath ſhould have ſwallowed them up, and conſumed them in a moment? <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith (<hi>Prov.</hi> 16.14.) <hi>The wrath of a King is as meſſengers of death, and like the roaring of a Lion (Prov.</hi> 19.12.) much more is the wrath of God like the roaring of a Lion, and as the meſſengers of death. But, though the Lord told <hi>Jobs</hi> friends of wrath, and of kindled wrath, yet he only, Firſt, reproved them mildly; and, Secondly, inſtead of blowing up that fire, ſheweth or directeth them how to quench it, and get into the Sun-ſhine of his favour; as will appear further in the verſe.</p>

                  <p>This verſe holds out the counſel or direction which the Lord gave <hi>Eliphaz</hi> and his two friends for the making of their peace, and the reconciling of themſelves to his Majeſty, whoſe wrath was kindled againſt them. And here the Lord directs them to a twofold means of their reconciliation.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The offering up of a ſacrifice, in which we may conſider two things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The matter of the ſacrifice, or what was to be ſacrificed, <hi>Bullocks and Rams.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, The quantity or number of the ſacrifice, <hi>ſeven and ſeven, ſeven Bullocks and ſeven Rams;</hi> ſuch was the matter, ſuch the quantity of the ſacrifice which they were commanded to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Lord directs <hi>Eliphaz</hi> and his two friends to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply themſelves unto <hi>Job,</hi> and deſire his interceſſion for them; <hi>Go to my ſervant</hi> Job, <hi>and my ſervant</hi> Job <hi>ſhall pray for you.</hi> To this direction the Lord ſubjoyns two things,</p>
                  <pb n="877" facs="tcp:48669:452"/>
                  <p>Firſt, An incouragement by a gracious promiſe, in theſe words; <hi>For him will I accept.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, A threat, in caſe they ſhould neglect or refuſe to go and perform this duty, laid down in the cloſe of the verſe; <hi>Leſt I deal with you according to your folly, in that ye have not ſpoken of me the thing which is right, like my ſervant</hi> Job.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the particulars conſiderable in this 8th verſe.</p>
                  <q>Therefore take unto you ſeven Bullocks and ſeven Rams.</q>
                  <p>The Lord ſpake this to <hi>Eliphaz</hi> and his two friends. The word of illation, <hi>Therefore,</hi> at the beginning of the verſe, refers to the word <hi>For,</hi> at the latter end of the former verſe. As if the Lord had ſaid unto them, <hi>Becauſe ye have ſinned againſt me, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked me to anger, ſo that my wrath is kindled by your not ſpeaking of me the thing that is right; therefore I adviſe you (and be ye ſure at your peril, to follow my advice; I adviſe you) for the making up of this breach, and the recovery of my favour, to take unto you ſeven Bullocks and ſeven Rams.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>Take unto you.</q>
                  <p>Some conceive that theſe words, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto you,</hi> are redundant, yet doubtleſs they carry a clear ſenſe, as they ſtand in the Text, <hi>Take unto you;</hi> that is, <hi>for your uſe</hi> and behoof in this great ſervice, <hi>Take unto you</hi>
                     <q>Seven Bullocks and ſeven Rams.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This was a great ſacrifice, and it was ſo under a twofold con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, As to the matter of the ſacrifice, <hi>bullocks and rams</hi> were great cattle, there were ſacrifices of leſſer matters. We read in the law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> of a pair of turtle doves, and two young pigeons for a ſacrifice; theſe, the poorer ſort under the law, did offer with acceptation, whereas rich and great men (and ſuch were theſe <hi>Eliphaz</hi> and his two friends in their time) were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to bring great and richer ſacrifices. The rich (as <hi>Solomon</hi> exhorts, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.9.) were to <hi>honour the Lord with their ſubſtance, and with the first fruits of their increaſe.</hi> Theſe rich men were to bring bullocks and rams, a great ſacrifice in the matter of it.</p>
                  <pb n="878" facs="tcp:48669:453"/>
                  <p>

                     </note>Secondly, It was a great ſacrifice, if we conſider the number, <hi>ſeven bullocks, and ſeven rams.</hi> One bullock was a ſacrifice, and one ram was a ſacrifice, but here God commanded ſeven of each. Seven is a number of perfection, and of plenitude; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is a great number, and ſeven is a perfect number: it is often uſed myſtically or <hi>enigmatically,</hi> to note perfection. The Lord made all things in ſix days, and reſted the ſeventh; ſeven days made up a compleat week, and ſeven years are a week of years. We read of <hi>A candleſtick all of gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and his ſeven lamps thereon, and ſeven pipes to the ſeven lamps which were on the top thereof</hi> (Zech. 4.2.) We read alſo of the <hi>ſeven ſpirits</hi> (Revel. 1.4) and of <hi>ſeven golden candleſticks</hi> (Rev. 1.12.) Theſe were myſterious <hi>ſevens,</hi> and there are many more mentioned in Scripture, which to inſiſt upon, would make too great a digreſſion from the purpoſe of the text under hand, where we have ſeven bullocks and ſeven rams, which make up and imply a great and perfect ſacrifice; as the law of <hi>Moſes</hi> alſo directed in ſome caſes (<hi>Levit,</hi> 23.18.) <hi>And ye ſhall offer with the bread ſeven lambs without blemiſh.</hi> So (1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.26.) <hi>When the Lord helped the Levites that bare the Arke of the Covenant of the Lord, they offered ſeven bullocks, and ſeven rams.</hi> Again (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.21) <hi>They brought ſeven bullocks, and ſeven rams, and ſeven lambs, and ſeven he-goats for a ſin-offering, for the kingdom, and for the ſanctuary, and for</hi> Judah. <hi>Balaam</hi> incited and hired to curſe <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſaid unto <hi>Balak</hi> (Num. 21.1.) <hi>Build me here ſeven altars, ſ prepare me here ſeven ſeven oxen, and rams,</hi> He would needs imitate them whom he deſired to ruin, and offer a full ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice that he might curſe them fully. The greateſt ſacrifice for number that we read of, was at the dedication of the Temple, where the offering of the King was <hi>two and twenty thouſand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thouſand (htep</hi> (l <hi>Kings</hi> 8.63.) We read alſo of great ſacrifices (1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.21. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17.11. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 30.24.) There were greater ſacrifices than ſeven, yet ſeven was a great ſacrifice. Some Interpreters conceive, that every one of the three was to offr ſeven bullocks, and ſeven rams; that had been a very great ſacrifice, but in that the Text is ſilent. The law of <hi>Moſes</hi> appointed (<hi>Levit.</hi> 4.3.) that if a Prieſt committed a ſin of ignorance, he ſhould <hi>bring a young bullock without blemiſh unto the Lord for a ſin-offering.</hi> Thelaw required
<pb n="879" facs="tcp:48669:453"/> no more for a ſin of ignorance in a Prieſt, and if the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation were guilty of a ſin of ignorance, their ossering was no more (<hi>ver.</hi> 13, 14.) and if a Ruler had committed a ſin of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, the law required only <hi>a kid of the goats, a male without blemiſh</hi> (ver. 23.) and if any one of the common people com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted a ſin of ignorance they were to bring <hi>a kid of the goat, a female</hi> (ver. 28.) So that whereas the law required but one bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock for the ſin of ignorance in a Prieſt, and but <hi>one bullock</hi> for the whole congregation; and for a Ruler, <hi>but a kid of the goats, a male;</hi> and for any common perſon, <hi>but a kid of the goats, a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male:</hi> Here <hi>Jobs</hi> friends were commanded by the Lord to offer up ſeven bullocks, and ſeven rams for the expiation of their ſin, which doubtleſs was only a ſin of ignorance. This plainly ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that the Lord was highly diſpleaſed with them for their harſh judgment, and uncharitable cenſures of his ſervant <hi>Job;</hi> and to let them know, that their doing ſo, could not be excuſed by their good intentions, and zeal for God.</p>
                  <p>Thus we ſee, what the ſacrifice was, both for kind and number. The next words tell us, what they muſt do with their ſacrifice.</p>
                  <q>Go to my ſervant <hi>Job (faith God)</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>Why to <hi>Job?</hi> ſeveral reaſons may be given, why they ſhould go to <hi>Job;</hi> I ſhall name five or ſix.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe they had wronged <hi>Job,</hi> and therefore they muſt be reconciled to him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Becauſe God would have them underſtand, that himſelf, notwithſtanding their ill opinion of <hi>Job,</hi> approved him as a good man, yea, as a man far exceeding them in godlineſs, though they had judged him an hypocrite, or an ungodly man. Thus the Lord ſent them to <hi>Job,</hi> that they might eat their words, and receive a full conviction of their error.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, God would have them go to his ſervant <hi>Job,</hi> to make them ſenſible, that the favour he intended them, was very much for <hi>Jobs</hi> ſake, and that they muſt, in part, be beholding to <hi>Job</hi> for it.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The Lord ſent them to <hi>Job,</hi> that he might give a high evidence of his grace, eſpecially, of his charity in forgetting injuries, and requiting good for evil. His friends had reproached him ten times, and grieved his ſpirit very much, yet he muſt
<pb n="880" facs="tcp:48669:454"/> ſhew how ready he was to forgive them, and pray that they might be forgiven.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, God would have them to go to <hi>Job,</hi> that they might know that <hi>Job</hi> was reconciled to them as well as himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, God would have them go to <hi>Job,</hi> that this might hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble them, or that they might ſhew their humility and ſubmiſſion. It was a great piece of ſelf-denial, for them to go to <hi>Job,</hi> after ſuch a conteſt; and entreat him to ſpeak for them, of whom they had ſpoken ſo hardly, and with whom they had long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ſo bitterly. Thus the Lord tried both <hi>Job</hi> and them; the Lord tried <hi>Jobs</hi> charity, and their humility. We are hardly brought to confeſs that we have wronged others, or have been out and miſtaken our ſelves. 'Tis no eaſie matter for a man to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge himſelf overcome; 'tis extream hard to become a ſuppliant to one, whom we lately deſpiſed and trampled upon. All this is his hard meat, and not eaſily digeſted; yet <hi>Eliphaz</hi> and his two friends muſt digeſt all this, before they could acceptably obey the Lords command, in going to his ſervant <hi>Job.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nor was it an eaſie matter, for <hi>Job</hi> to forget ſo many affronts and unkindneſſes, as he had received from his friends. ' Tis hard for a man that hath been wronged and reproached, yea, condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to paſs air by, and not only embrace his oppoſers and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachers, but pray and ſolicite for them. Thus the Lord, in ſending them to <hi>Job,</hi> took tryal both of <hi>Job</hi> and them. The Lord commanding them to ſupplicate him, whom they had offended, and expecting that he ſhould make ſuit and ſupplication for them who had offended him; put both their graces to it, and in a moſt ſweet and gracious way, at once healed the breach, which had been between <hi>Job</hi> and them, as alſo that between them and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Who ever took up a difference more ſweetly, or reunited diſſenting brethren thus wiſely? <hi>Go to my ſervant</hi> Job,</p>
                  <q>And offer up for your ſelves a burnt-offering.</q>
                  <p>That is, thoſe ſeven bullocks, and ſeven rams.</p>
                  <p>Here (as was ſaid before) was the facrifice; but who was the Prieſt? The text ſaith, <hi>Offer up for your ſelves,</hi> which may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate that, that as they were to offer a ſacrifice for themſelves, ſo, that they themſelves offered it. But as Interpreters gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,
<pb n="881" facs="tcp:48669:454"/> ſo I conceive <hi>Job</hi> was the Prieſt, who offered it in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, We read (<hi>chap.</hi> 1.5.) that <hi>Job</hi> offered ſacrifices for his children, and there it was ſhewed that he was the Prieſt. Every ſacrifice muſt be offered by a Prieſt; the people brought the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice unto him to offer for them. No ſacrifice is acceptable without a Prieſt: Therefore Jeſus Chriſt, who was our ſacrifice, was a Prieſt alſo, none could offer him but himſelf, he was both ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, and Prieſt, and Altar. So then, whereas the Text ſaith, they were to <hi>offer a burnt-offering for themſelves,</hi> the meaning is, they were to bring it unto <hi>Job,</hi> and he to offer it for them. <hi>The Prieſt offered, and</hi> Iſrael <hi>offered;</hi> that is, <hi>Iſrael</hi> offered by the Prieſt; they brought the matter of the ſacrifice to the Prieſt, and the Prieſt ſlew and preſented the ſacrifice to the Lord. It is one thing to offer, another thing to ſlay the ſacrifice. They offered a ſacrifice who brought it, or at their coſt cauſed it to be brought to the holy place; and this any of the people might do. They of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it upon the Altar to the Lord, who were eſpecially appointed thereunto: Theſe were the Prieſts only. Before the Ceremonial law, as given by God to <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Prieſt-hood lay in the eldeſt or father of the family, upon which account <hi>Job</hi> was a Prieſt; whereas afterwards, the Prieſt-hood was ſettled in the family of <hi>Aaron,</hi> and it was forbidden to any, but one of hs line, to offer ſacrifice.</p>
                  <p>So that, when the Lord ſaid to <hi>Eliphaz</hi> and his two friends, <hi>Go to my ſervant</hi> Job, <hi>and offer up for your ſelves a burnt-offering,</hi> he directed them to <hi>Job,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Non eſt hic cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſè captendo diſtinctio holo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſti aboliis victimis cim haec ante le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem contigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vint.

                  </p>
                  <q>A burnt-offering.</q>
                  <p>That is, <hi>a ſacrifice wholly conſumed by fire.</hi> The Hebrew is very elegant, <hi>make an aſcentton to aſcend.</hi> The <hi>whole burnt-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> was the moſt perfect offering; and therefore the Hebrews ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it by a word that ſignifieth the perfect conſumption of it in the fire, and ſo the aſcention of it to heaven in ſmoke and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour, as a ſweet odour in the noſtrils of the Lord, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks (<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.1.) and as <hi>David (Pſal.</hi> 141.2.) A part of many ſacrifices was ſaved to feaſt upon afterwards, as the harlot ſpake (<hi>Prov.</hi> 7.14.) <hi>I have peace-offerings with me; this day
<pb n="882" facs="tcp:48669:455"/> have I payed my vows:</hi> but the burnt-offering was wholly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, and ſent up unto the Lord. <hi>Go to my ſervant</hi> Job, <hi>and offer up for your ſelves a burnt-offering.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Lord is very ready to forgive; and to be at peace with thoſe that have offended him.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though the fire of his wrath be kindled (as it is ſaid in the former verſe) yet he is willing to have it quenched. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Micah</hi> (chap. 7.18.) makes this report of God, <hi>He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth not his anger for ever,</hi> that is, he retaineth it but a little while, he is ſpeedily pacified, and forgives; and ſometimes (as here) he forgives, without any higher ſignification of his anger than a bare rebuke. The Lord did not lay the leaſt mul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t, the leaſt chaſtning or affliction upon <hi>Eliphaz</hi> and his two friends, though his wrath was kindled againſt them. I grant, it is not ſo always; ſome ſmart ſorely, and pay dearly for their errors. When <hi>the anger of the Lord was kindled againſt</hi> Aaron <hi>and</hi> Miriam (<hi>Num.</hi> 12.9.) for ſpeaking againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> (as thoſe three had againſt <hi>Job</hi>) he was not then ſo eaſily pacified; for, firſt, it is ſaid in the cloſe of the 9th verſe, <hi>he departed,</hi> and (<hi>ver.</hi> 10.) <hi>the cloud departed from off the tabernacle;</hi> here was much diſpleaſure, yet not all, for it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, <hi>and behold</hi> Miriam <hi>became leprous, white as ſnow.</hi> In this caſe God was angry with two that had ſpoken againſt a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of his; and they felt more than a bare rebuke, here was a blow given, and that a ſore one. The Lord deals gently with ſome ſinners, that none may deſpair; and ſeverely with others, though his ſervants, that none may preſume.</p>
                  <p>Only let us remember, that when the Lord at any time doth chaſten and rebuke his ſervants for ſin with great ſeverity, he doth not drive them away, nor diſcourage them, but would have them look to him for pardon and healing. When <hi>he judgeth them</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.32.) he doth not condemn them; or if we call it a condemnation, yet he doth not condemn them with the world, nor as he condemns the world. God condemns the unbelieving world to deſtruction, but he condemns his ſervants only for their humiliation. The goodneſs of God appears much in theſe two things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, In his flowneſs to anger, his mercy doth even clog his juſtice, and gives it leaden feet, it comes ſlowly.</p>
                  <pb n="883" facs="tcp:48669:455"/>
                  <p>Secondly, In his readineſs to ſhow mercy. The Scripture ſaith he is <hi>ſlow to wrath, and ready to forgive;</hi> his goodneſs doth even adde wings to his mercy, cauſing it to fly ſwiftly, to the relief of ſenſible and humbled ſinners; or (as one of the Ancients expreſſeth, he ſharpneth the ſword of his juſtice with the oile of his mercy; and ſo it becomes a healing, as well as a wounding, ſword.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, In that the Lord himſelf gave this direction, <hi>Take unto you ſeven bullocks, and ſeven rams,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve;
<q>God, againſt whom we ſin, ſheweth us the way to get peace, and the pardon of our ſins.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>When man ſinned at firſt, or when the firſt man fell into ſin, there he had lain for ever, if the Lord had not ſhewed him a way out: Had it been left to man to deviſe a way to recover himſelf when he was fallen, his fall had been irrecoverable, he had never found how to get at once his ſin pardoned, and the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God ſatisfied. This was the <hi>Lords own invention</hi> (and it was the moſt noble and excellent one, that ever was in the world) he ſhewed fallen man at firſt how to get up; and here he gave di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection to theſe fallen men, what to do that they might: The Lord, who was their Judge, was alſo their Counſellor.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Conſider the particular way of their peace-making, it was by ſacrifice, <hi>Take unto you ſeven bullocks, and ſeven rams,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>Sacrifices for ſin were appointed and commanded by God, not deviſed by man.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sacrifices have been from the beginning. <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> brought their offerings unto the Lord (<hi>Gen.</hi> 4.3, 4.) <hi>Noah,</hi> alſo, <hi>builded an altar unto the Lord, and offered burnt-offerings on the altar</hi> (Gen. 8.20.) <hi>Abraham</hi> offered the ram for a burnt-offering (<hi>Gen.</hi> 22.13.) Now though the law for ſacrifices was not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally given in thoſe times, yet it was really given. All thoſe elder ſacrifices were of the Lords appointment, and by his dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as well as thoſe in and after the days of <hi>Moſes. There is no expiating of ſin againſt God, by the inventions of man.</hi> Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens offered ſacrifices to their Idol-gods, imitating the worſhip
<pb n="884" facs="tcp:48669:456"/> of the true God (The Devil is Gods ape.) Typical ſacrifices were of God, for the taking away of the ſin of man: And ſo was the true ſacrifice, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; when <hi>he</hi> (that is, Chriſt) <hi>ſaid, ſacrifice and offering, and burnt-offering, and offering for ſin, thou wouldſt not</hi> (that is, thou wouldſt not have thoſe legal ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, nor didſt ever intend to have them, as ſatisfactions to thy offended juſtice, ultimately to reſt in them) <hi>then ſaid he</hi> (that is, Chriſt) <hi>Lo, I come to do thy will, O God</hi> (Heb. 10.8, 9.) It was the will of God, that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould be the expiatory ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for the ſin of man; by the which will (<hi>v.</hi> 10.) <hi>We are ſanctified through the offering of the body of Jeſus Chriſt once for all.</hi> The ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Chriſt himſelf had not ſaved us, if it had not been of Gods appointment; nor could any ſacrifice have ſo much as ſhadowed the way or means of our ſalvation, if God had not appointed it.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Conſider the purpoſe for which the Lord command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> &amp;c. to offer their ſacrifice, it was to make an attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for their ſin.</p>
                  <p>Hence Obſerve;
<q>Sin muſt have a ſacrifice.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>There was never any way in the world, from firſt to laſt, to help a ſinner but by a ſacrifice; and who was the ſacrifice? Surely Jeſus Chriſt was the ſacrifice; it was not the blood of bulls and goats, of bullocks and rams, that could take away ſin, as the Apoſtle argueth at large in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> theſe could never take away ſin, theſe only pointed at Jeſus Chriſt, who alone did it, by bearing our ſins, and by being made a ſacrifice for them. To typifie or ſhew this, we read in the law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that the ſin of the offender was laid upon the ſacrifice; and a ſacrifice for ſin, was called ſin by the Prophet, long before Chriſt came (<hi>Dan.</hi> 9.24.) <hi>He ſhall make an end of ſin,</hi> that is, when Chriſt ſhall come in the fleſh, he ſhall make an end of all ſacrifices for ſin; and ſo the Apoſtle called it after Chriſt was come, and had ſuffered in the fleſh (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21.) <hi>He made him to be ſin</hi> (that is, a ſacrifice for ſin) <hi>for us, who knew no ſin, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him.</hi> The ſacrifice was called <hi>ſin,</hi> becauſe the ſin of the perſon who brought it, and in whoſe behalf it was offered, was laid upon the ſacrifice; there was as it were a tranſlation of the ſin, from the perſon to the ſacrifice. In which ſence <hi>Luther</hi> is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood,
<pb n="885" facs="tcp:48669:456"/> when he ſaid, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt was the greateſt ſinner in the world;</hi> not that he had any ſin in his nature, or any ſin in his life, but becauſe he had the ſins of all that are or ſhall be ſaved, laid upon him; as the Prophet ſpake (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.6.) <hi>The Lord hath laid upon him the iniquity of us all;</hi> or (as our Margin hath it) <hi>He hath made the iniquity of us all to meet on him.</hi> And there is no atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for ſin, but by a ſacrifice. So the Lord ordained the offering up of a whole burnt-offering for the taking away of ſin, that ſinners might ſee what they had deſerved, even to die; and not only ſo, but to be wholly burnt and conſumed in the fire of his wrath. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent ſinners ſhall be conſumed in fire, that ſhall never be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed, nor ever extinguiſh them; they ſhall abide in an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-living death, or in an ever-dying life. They who reſt not upon the ſacrifice of Chriſt, once offered, muſt be a ſacrifice them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, alwayes offered to the juſtice and wrath of God.</p>
                  <p>Here it may be queſtioned, why the Lord commanded them to offer ſeven Bullocks and ſeven Rams? what could the blood of ſeven do more than the blood of one?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, Firſt; This being a great ſacrifice, poſſibly the Lord commanded it, thereby to intimate the greatneſs of their ſin. Two things chiefly ſhew the greatneſs of a ſin. Firſt, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the puniſhment laid upon the ſinner. Secondly, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the means uſed for the healing of that breach which ſin hath made.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, Secondly, the number ſeven being a Symbol of perfection (as was ſaid before) figured the perfect ſacrifice of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>who by one offering, hath for ever perfected them that are ſanctified (Heb.</hi> 10.14.) A perfect number of ſacrifices was fitteſt to ſhadow the infinite perfection of that one ſacrifice, which makes, and which only makes all the comers thereunto perfect. For though a perſon under the Law having offered his ſacrifice, was no more reckoned guilty of that ſin by men; yet his conſcience did ſtill accuſe him of, and charge him with ſin, and therefore ſacrifices were renewed (<hi>Heb.</hi> 10.1, 2.) nor could the accuſings of conſcience be quieted, but by looking to Chriſt by faith, whom the ſacrifice ſhadowed, and the ſacrificer was to point at.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, In that the Lord ſent <hi>Eliphaz</hi> and his two friends un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Job</hi> with their ſacrifice,</p>
                  <pb n="886" facs="tcp:48669:457"/>
                  <p>Obſerve;
<q>We muſt reconcile our ſelves to thoſe we have wronged, before we can look to be reconciled unto God, againſt whom we have ſinned, or to be accepted of him in any ſervice.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The counſel of Chriſt directs to this (<hi>Mat.</hi> 5.23, 24.) <hi>If thou bringeſt thy gift unto the Altar, and there remembreſt that thy brother hath ought againſt thee, leave there thy gift before the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, and go thy way; firſt be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.</hi> This general command of Chriſt, is the ſame in effect, with what the Lord here long before gave parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly and perſonally to <hi>Eliphaz</hi> and his two friends; they muſt firſt go and be reconciled to <hi>Job,</hi> and then offer their ſacrifice. This the Apoſtle alſo gave in charge (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.8.) <hi>I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that men pray every where, holding up holy hands;</hi> but how? <hi>without wrath and doubting.</hi> There are two things required, if we look to be accepted of God in any ſervice. Firſt, Faith. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Love or charity. There muſt be faith, elſe we cannot lift up <hi>holy hands without doubting:</hi> There muſt be love, elſe we cannot <hi>lift up holy hands without wrath.</hi> They who are ſuing for, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting favour and mercy from God, have need to diſcharge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of all wrath and revenge towards man. With what face can any expect favour from God, who will not acknowledge wherein they have wronged man?</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Obſerve;
<q>God is very tender of the credit of his faithful ſervants; he will not be reconciled, unleſs they are righted.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Job</hi> had been wronged, no man more, by the cenſures of his friends; and God was ſo tender of his honour and reputation, that his friends muſt make him reparation, before God will accept their ſacrifice. One reaſon why God is ſo tender of the credit of his ſervants, is, becauſe they are tender of his, and will undergo any wrong, rather than his Name ſhall be blaſphemed or wronged. As God will himſelf honour them, who honour him (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.30.) ſo he will one time or other, ſome way or other, retrench and caſt back upon men, all that diſhonor which they have received from men, or cauſe them to take it off, and wipe them clean whom they have undeſervedly aſperſed.</p>
                  <pb n="887" facs="tcp:48669:457"/>
                  <p>Obſerve, Seventhly;
<q>God will humble proud and high ſpirits, and make them ſubmit to thoſe whom they have wronged.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is a twofold ſubmiſſion, which is the duty of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. Firſt, to God (<hi>James</hi> 4.7.) Secondly, to man; and this is twofold.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To thoſe that are over us, and above us, in power (<hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.1.) And thus not only are ſubjects to ſubmit to Magiſtrates; but all of a lower degree, are to ſubmit to their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours, ſervants to their Maſters, wives to their Husbands, children to their parents.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There is a ſubmiſſion to thoſe that are wronged by us; and though they be our inferiours, yet (in this ſenſe) we are to ſubmit to them, that is, acknowledge that we have wronged them. The Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> intimates ſuch a ſubmiſſion (Chap. 5.16.) and the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks it plainly (<hi>Eph.</hi> 5.21.) <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting your ſelves to one another in the fear of God.</hi> Here is a mutual ſubmiſſion, a ſubmiſſion in caſe of wrong (and doubtleſs that rule of Scripture is extendible to other caſes) not only of equals one to another, but of ſuperiours to inferiours. Our ſpirits like not this, we hardly ſubmit to thoſe that we have wronged; but there's no remedy, we muſt. Some ſay they will ſubmit to God, but they cannot ſubmit to man, they cannot ſtoop to that. Let ſuch remember, that without this ſubmiſſion, even to an inferiour whom we have knowingly wronged, or are made to know (which was the caſe here) that we have wronged, we cannot hopefully apply to God for peace and reconciliation.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, Obſerve;
<q>They that are wronged by others, muſt forgive them their wrongs.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>God ſent <hi>Eliphaz</hi> and his two friends to <hi>Job,</hi> not only that they ſhould acknowledge they had wronged him, but that <hi>Job</hi> might free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and fully teſtifie (ſo far as concerned him) his forgiveneſs of that wrong. As it is the duty of them that have wronged others to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to them in the acknowledgement of it; ſo they that are wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ought to forgive &amp; receive them in that ſubmiſſion. We muſt forgive, as we look to be forgiven (<hi>Mat.</hi> 6.12.) We cannot pray
<pb n="888" facs="tcp:48669:458"/> believingly, that God would forgive us the guilt of our iniquity committed againſt himſelf or others, unleſs we forgive others the injury which they have done us.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve, Ninthly;
<q>Good men are ready to give and take ſatisfaction in point of wrong.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jobs</hi> friends had done him wrong; and as they (good men) were ready to give ſatisfaction, ſo <hi>Job</hi> (good man) was as ready to take it. Many wrong others, but will give no ſatisfaction; many are wronged by others, and will take no ſatisfaction, nothing will quiet or appeaſe them. <hi>Jobs</hi> friends and himſelf were highly to be commended, that they were willing to give, and he to take ſatisfaction. The Apoſtle urgeth this (<hi>Eph.</hi> 4.26, 27.) <hi>Be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry and ſin not, let not the Sun go down upon your wrath, neither give place to the devil.</hi> They give up their hearts as lodging-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to the devil, who let the Sun go down upon their wrath; therefore it followeth (<hi>verſ.</hi> 31.32.) <hi>Let all bitterneſs, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil ſpeaking, be put away from you, with all malice, and be ye kind one to another, tender-hearted, forgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another, even as God for Chriſt ſake hath forgiven you.</hi> They that know what it is to be forgiven by God, they that know what need they have continually of Gods forgiving grace &amp; mercy, will be as ready to accept ſatisfaction, as any can be to give it. This was eminent in <hi>Job,</hi> as will appear further in opening the next words in this verſe. <hi>Go to my ſervant</hi> Job, <hi>and offer up for your ſelves a burnt-offering,</hi>
                     <q>And my ſervant <hi>Job</hi> ſhall pray for you.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>How eminent <hi>Job</hi> was in prayer, and how available his prayers or interceſſions were for others, may be collected from that in the Prophet (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 14.14.) where he is joyned with <hi>Noah</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel. Job</hi> being here called to pray for his friends, was put upon another piece of the Prieſtly Office. There were two parts of the Prieſtly Office, and <hi>Job</hi> is adorned with them both. Firſt, the Prieſt was to offer ſacrifice. Secondly, to pray for the people. Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt filled up both theſe parts of the Prieſtly office for us. Firſt, he offered himſelf a ſacrifice for us. Secondly, he interce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, yea, he ever liveth to make interceſſion for us (<hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25.)
<pb n="889" facs="tcp:48669:458"/> 
                     <hi>Job,</hi> as in offering up a ſacrifice, ſo in praying for his faulty friends, was a type of Chriſt; <hi>My ſervant</hi> Job <hi>ſhall pray for you.</hi> But for what ſhould he pray in their behalf? Surely, that their ſin might be forgiven, and they find favour with God,</p>
                  <p>The word here rendred to <hi>Pray for,</hi> is elegant and ſignificant,<note place="margin">Verbum perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net ad rem fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renſem &amp; judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cialem; ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat orare vel deprecari more ejus qui ad judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicem appellat, &amp; illum ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex adit &amp; precabundus. <hi>Coc.</hi>
                     </note> implying a forinſecal act, when an advocate in Court moves the Judge in behalf of an offender; ſo that when the Lord ſaith, <hi>My ſervant</hi> Job <hi>ſhall pray for you,</hi> his meaning is, he ſhall deprecate the wrath and vengeance that your ſin hath deſerved, and entreat my favour for you, and ſeek your peace with me. <hi>My ſervant</hi> Job <hi>ſhall pray for you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence obſerve, Firſt;
<q>It is a duty to pray for thoſe that have wronged us.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Not only is it a duty to forgive them, and be reconciled to them; but to pray for them, and heartily wiſh their good. The Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> having ſaid (Chap. 5.16.) <hi>Confeſs your faults one to another;</hi> preſently adds, <hi>Pray for one another:</hi> yea, Chriſt commands us to pray for the good, not only of thoſe that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs they have wronged us, and deſire reconciliation to us, but to pray for our enemies, that is, ſuch as ſtill hate us, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to contrive all the miſchief they can againſt us. It is a duty, not only to pray for them that acknowledge their fault, but for the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> alſo who go on in their fault againſt us; enemies do ſo. <hi>Bleſs them that curſe you, do good to them that hate you, pray for them that deſpitefully uſe you and perſecute you.</hi> Theſe are Chriſts, not only counſels, but commands (<hi>Mat.</hi> 5.44.) Even for them we ſhould pray, that God would pardon their ſin, turn their hearts, and give them repentance, which is the beſt we can pray for them.</p>
                  <p>Again, the Lord ſaith, <hi>My ſervant</hi> Job <hi>ſhall pray for you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence obſerve, Secondly;
<q>God undertakes and gives his word for a good man, that he will do his duty.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>God having ſpoken to <hi>Job</hi> about this matter, undertook for his performance; <hi>My ſervant</hi> Job <hi>ſhall pray for you,</hi> I will put it into his heart to do it. The Lord may very well be bound for a good man, that he ſhall do his duty, becauſe, as he hath promiſed,
<pb n="890" facs="tcp:48669:459"/> ſo he will help him to do his duty. Thus the Lord engaged for <hi>Abraham (Gen.</hi> 18.19.) <hi>Shall I hide from</hi> Abraham <hi>the thing that I am doing? I know</hi> Abraham (I am well enough acquainted with <hi>Abraham) that he will command his children and his houſhold after him, and they ſhall keep the way of the Lord.</hi> I know him, I will be ſurety for him. The Lord ſpeaks with confidence concerning his people, that they will do this and that, they will humble themſelves before him, and that they will forgive and pray for their enemies; he knows they will do all theſe things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he knows he hath given them power and a heart to do them. The Apoſtle was confident of the obedience of the Church of <hi>Galatia (Gal.</hi> 5.10.) <hi>I have</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>co fidence in you, through the Lord, that you will be none otherwiſe minded.</hi> When the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle undertook that they ſhould do their duty, he did it reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively to a divine aſſiſtance and preſence with them; <hi>I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in you</hi> (not in your ſelves, but) <hi>through the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. but God undertakes abſolutely, <hi>My ſervant</hi> Job <hi>ſhall pray for you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Note;
<q>The prayers and interceſſions of the righteous, prevail much with God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Lord having aſſured them that his ſervant <hi>Job</hi> ſhould pray for them, tells them in the next words, <hi>Him will I accept;</hi> which intimates, that his p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ayers ſhould have a great power with God for them (<hi>James</hi> 5.16.) <hi>The effectual fervent prayer of a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man availeth much;</hi> and it doth ſo in a twofold reſpect.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, For him<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>elf. A godly man gets much good of God in his own caſe, by prayer.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It prevails very much with God, in reſpect of others. 'Tis a great honour with which the Lord crowns the prayers of his faithful ſervants, that they prevail, not only for themſelves, but for others. Thus the Lord ſpake to <hi>Abimelech (Gen.</hi> 20.7) <hi>Now therefore reſtore this man</hi> (meaning <hi>Abraham) his wife, for he is a Prophet, and he ſhall pray for thee.</hi> And his prayer was anſwered. When the Lord had ſmitten <hi>Miriam</hi> with the Leproſie, <hi>Moſes cryed unto the Lord, ſaying, heal her now, O God, I beſeech thee; and ſhe was healed (Numb.</hi> 12.13.) Thus <hi>Samuels</hi> prayer prevailed (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.9.) <hi>And</hi> Samuel <hi>took a ſucking Lamb, and offered it up for a burnt-offering, and</hi> Samuel <hi>cryed unto the Lord for Iſrael</hi> (not for himſelf, but for <hi>Iſrael) and the Lord heard him.</hi> And in the
<pb n="891" facs="tcp:48669:459"/> twelfth Chapter of the ſame Book (<hi>verſ.</hi> 19.) the people beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged prayers of <hi>Samuel; And all the people ſaid unto</hi> Samuel, <hi>pray for thy ſervants unto the Lord thy God, that we die not.</hi> And at the 23d verſe, <hi>Samuel</hi> ſaid, <hi>As for me, God forbid that I ſhould ſin againſt the Lord, in ceaſing to pray for you, but I will teach you the good and the right way; and he prayed for them, and the Lord ſpared the people at that time.</hi> Not to pray for others, proceeds from uncharitableneſs: not to deſire the prayers of others, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds either from ignorance, not knowing of what value the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of others, who are godly, are; or from pride, that we will not be beholding to others for their prayers. It is a great mercy to have the prayers of good men going for us.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Note;
<q>The prayers of others may prevail with God, when our own cannot.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eliphaz</hi> and his two friends were good men, yet the Lord did not give anſwer to them, but to the prayers of <hi>Job.</hi> The prayers of others may be anſwered, when ours are not, in a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reſpect.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Others may be in a better p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aying frame than our ſelves. Every one that is in a praying ſtate, is not alwayes in a praying frame, eſpecially not in ſuch a praying frame as another may be in; another may be in a better praying frame, and ſo may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail more for us, than we for our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Some other perſons may be more accepted with God, than we; ſome are, as it were, <hi>favourites</hi> with God. God ſhews favour to all his ſervants, but all his ſervants are not his favourites: <hi>Moſes</hi> was a favourite, <hi>Abraham</hi> was a favourite, God called him his friend; and <hi>Job</hi> was a favourite. The Lord ſhews favour to many, who yet are not his favourites. Kings and P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſhew favour to all their faithful ſubjects, yet but one (poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly) is a <hi>Favourite.</hi> The Lords chief favourite, is his Son Jeſus Chriſt, he hath his ear continually: <hi>I knew,</hi> ſaid Chriſt (<hi>John</hi> 11.42.) <hi>that thou heareſt me alwayes.</hi> Now, as Chriſt is a favourite above all men; ſo among good men, ſome have favour with God above others. A King will hear a favourite, when he will not a common perſon. Our Annotators upon this very place, tell us out of Mr. <hi>Fox,</hi> that when Sir <hi>John Goſtwich</hi> had falſely accuſed
<pb n="892" facs="tcp:48669:460"/> Arch-Biſhop <hi>Cranmer</hi> to King <hi>Henry</hi> the VIII, he would not hear him, nor be reconciled to him, till <hi>Cranmer</hi> himſelf, whom he had wronged, came and ſpake for him. Thus the Lord will not be reconciled to ſome, till the wronged party intercedes for them. Yet we muſt remember, that the power or effect of all our prayers, depends upon Jeſus Chriſt alone; by him it is, that any have acceſs to the father, and he is the way to the holieſt, the beloved, in whom God is well pleaſed, whom he heareth always, and through whom God heareth his beſt beloved favourites on earth.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve, Fifthly;
<q>It is a great mercy to have the prayers of a good man going for us.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Lord told not <hi>Eliphaz</hi> and his two friends, of any thing elſe that <hi>Job</hi> ſhould do for them, he only ſaith, Job <hi>my ſervant ſhall pray for you.</hi> If the Lord doth but ſtir up the heart of a <hi>Job,</hi> of a <hi>Moſes,</hi> of a <hi>Jacob,</hi> a Wreſtler in prayer, to pray for us, who knows what mercy we may receive by it! And therefore, when the Lord forbids his favourites to pray for a people, as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he doth, it is a ſign that ſuch are in a very ſad condition, yea, that their caſe is deſperate. <hi>Jeremiah</hi> was a mighty man with the Lord in prayer, and the Lord ſaid to him (<hi>Jer.</hi> 14.11.) <hi>Pray not to me for this people for good. Jeremiah</hi> was forward to pray for them, but the Lord ſtopt him, <hi>Pray no more;</hi> not that the Lord diſliked his prayer; but, becauſe he was reſolved not to forgive them, though he prayed for them, therefore he ſaid, <hi>pray not.</hi> The Lord would not let ſuch precious waters run waſt, as the prayers of <hi>Jeremiah</hi> were. They are in a remedileſs, ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, of whom the Lord ſaith, pray not for them. Of ſuch the Apoſtle ſpake (1 <hi>John</hi> 5.16.) <hi>If any man ſee his brother ſin a ſin not unto death, he ſhall ask and God ſhall give him life. There is a ſin unto death, I ſay not that he ſhall pray for it. The pardon of a ſin unto death is not to be prayed for.</hi> Every ſin deſerves death, but every ſin is not unto death: They who ſin ſo, are paſt prayer; and in how woful a plight are they, whoſe ſins are paſt prayers! They who have been much in prayer themſelves, and afterwards fall off from, or walk contrary unto their prayers, come at laſt to this miſerable iſſue, that either they give over praying for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or others are ſtopt from praying for them. And though an
<pb n="893" facs="tcp:48669:460"/> outward bar be not laid upon their friends prayer, as in <hi>Iſraels</hi> caſe, yet there may be a bar upon the ſpirit of ſuch as uſed to pray for them. It is a bad ſign, when the Lord ſhuts up the heart from praying for any one; and it is a ſign of mercy, when the Lord inlargeth the heart of any that are godly to pray for others.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Obſerve;
<q>Prayer for another doth not profit him, unleſs he be faithful himſelf.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ground it upon the text, <hi>Job ſhall pray for you;</hi> but you muſt carry a ſacrifice, which implied their faith; and they muſt carry a ſacrifice to <hi>Job,</hi> and that implied their repentance; and both implied that they prayed for themſelves alſo. It is in vain to offer a ſacrifice without faith and repentance (being in this frame) <hi>My ſervant</hi> Job <hi>ſhall pray for you.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Conjunctis pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibus nihil im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petratu impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibile eſt. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctae autem preces eſſe non poſſunt ubi eſt offenſio. <hi>Coc. vid.</hi>
                     </note> The prayer of faith prevails not for thoſe that go on in their unbelief and impeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. <hi>Job</hi> prayed for his friends; and they repenting and believing, he prevailed for them. The reaſon why the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> in the place before mentioned, as alſo (<hi>chap.</hi> 7.16.) was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded not to pray for that people, was, becauſe they were a hardened people in their ſins, and therefore his prayers could do them no good. Yea, the Lord told him (<hi>cha.</hi> 15.2.) that though not only he, but other great favourites joyned in prayer for them, it ſhould do them no good. <hi>Though</hi> Moſes <hi>and</hi> Samuel <hi>ſtood before me, my mind could not be towards this people.</hi> The reaſon why thoſe eminent favourites, and mighty men in prayer, could do no good, was (as was ſaid before) becauſe they were unbelieving, and hardned in their ſins, as appears upon the place. The Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſpeaks the ſame thing (<hi>chap.</hi> 14.14.) <hi>Though theſe three men,</hi> Noah, Daniel, <hi>and</hi> Job (this <hi>Job</hi> that we have in the text) <hi>were in it, they ſhould deliver but their own ſouls by their righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, ſaith the Lord. Jobs</hi> prayers obtained good for his friends; but the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were in ſuch a condition, that though <hi>Noah, Daniel,</hi> and <hi>Job</hi> were praying for them, they ſhould get no good by it; their ſins were ſo high, and their hearts ſo hard, that the prayers of the holieſt men in the world could not prevail with God for mercy.</p>
                  <pb n="894" facs="tcp:48669:461"/>
                  <p>It cannot be denied, but the prayers of a godly man may profit a wicked man, an unbeliever, an impenitent perſon, for his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion to the faith, and the bringing of him to repentance; but they profit not any man, who as he hath not faith, ſo continues in his unbelief.</p>
                  <p>Yet, I grant, that the prayers of a believer may profit ſuch an unbeliever, as to the avoiding of ſome temporal evil, or as to the obtaining of ſome temporal good; as is clear in <hi>Abrahams</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for <hi>Abimelech</hi> (Gen. 20.7.) But how much ſoever a godly man prayeth for the pardon of a wicked mans ſin, or the ſalvation of his ſoul, he ſhall never be pardoned or ſaved, unleſs himſelf repent and believe. They who never pray in faith for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſhall not get favour with God, by any prayer of faith made by others for them.</p>
                  <p>Now as from this, and ſuch like Scriptures, it appears, that the prayers of godly men, for good men here on earth, are very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing unto the Lord, and receive great anſwers: So they do ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdly, who, from this Scripture infer, that the Saints departed pray for us, as if they knew or underſtood our condition; and they do more abſurdly, who living here on earth, pray to the Saints in heaven to pray for them. The Scripture ſpeaks nothing of prayers to departed Saints, nor of departed Saints praying for us; the Scripture ſpeaks only of the living on earth, praying for thoſe that live on earth. <hi>Job</hi> was alive in the body, and ſo were thoſe three men, to whom the Lord ſaid, <hi>My ſervant</hi> Job <hi>ſhall pray for you.</hi>
                  </p>

<pb n="895" facs="tcp:48669:461"/> upon us,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> prayed (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.6.) we cannot with any comfort, much leſs with true confidence, lift up our face or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance unto God. That's the ſignificancy of the word.</p>
                  <q>Him will I accept.</q>
                  <p>God is no accepter of perſons, as the word is often uſed in Scripture (<hi>Deut.</hi> 10.17.) <hi>The Lord is a great God, mighty and terrible, which regardeth not perſons.</hi> It is the ſame phraſe in the Hebrew, with this in the Text, <hi>he lifteth not up faces,</hi> that is, the Lord doth not accept perſons upon any outward reſpect.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The Lord doth not <hi>accept perſons for their perſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> as I may ſay; the Lord doth not <hi>delight in any mans legs, his delight is in them that fear him</hi> (Pſal. 147.10, 11.) he doth not accept men for their goodly ſtature, as he told <hi>Samuel,</hi> when he would needs have poured the oile upon the firſt-born of the Sons of <hi>Jeſſe</hi> (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.7.) Look not on his countenance, or <hi>on the height of his ſtature, becauſe I have refuſed him: for the Lord ſeeth not as man ſeeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart.</hi> 'Tis the beauty of holineſs and integrity in the heart, not the beauty of fairneſs upon the face, with which God is taken; 'tis a lowly mind, not a high ſtature, which God accepts.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Lord is no accepter of perſons, as to the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or country where they were born or live. Thus the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſpake (<hi>Acts</hi> 10.35.) <hi>I perceive, that God is no reſpecter of perſons; but in every Nation, he that feareth him and worketh righteouſneſs, is accepted with him.</hi> God doth not prefer <hi>Jews</hi> before <hi>Gentiles, Barbarians</hi> or <hi>Scythians:</hi> that a man had his birth in this or that Nation, neither helps nor hinders acceptation with God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Lord accepteth no mans perſon for his riches (<hi>Prov.</hi> 11.4.) <hi>Riches profit not in the day of wrath.</hi> No mans perſon is acceptable to God for his purſe, or his penny, no not at all.</p>

The great God regardeth not any man meerly for greatneſs; the Lord accepts no mans perſon upon theſe
<pb n="896" facs="tcp:48669:462"/> or any ſuch like accounts: He only accepts the perſons of thoſe that fear him, and do his will.</p>

Thirdly, (Which is here ſpecially intended) to anſwer his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and grant his requeſts, not only for himſelf, but for others. When a perſon is once accepted, his prayers ſhall not be denied, nor ſuffer a repulſe. The Lord accepteth perſons, as a King the perſons of thoſe loyal Subjects, who come to intreat his favour and pardon for thoſe that have offended him, and rebelled againſt him; he grants their ſuit, and treats them fairly. In this ſenſe the Lord maketh promiſe to <hi>Eliphaz</hi> and his two friends, that he will <hi>accept</hi> Job.</p>
                  <p>Hence, Obſerve;
<q>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is a very high favour and priviledge to be accepted of God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Him will I accept,</hi> ſaith the Lord, of <hi>Job.</hi> This was a favour beyond all the favours, that follow after in the cloſe of the book, about the doubling of his eſtate. If <hi>Jacob</hi> (Gen 32.20.) was ſo taken with a hope of acceptance by his brother <hi>Eſau; Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure he will accept me;</hi> If when he was accepted by <hi>Eſau,</hi> he ſaid (<hi>chap.</hi> 33.10.) <hi>I have ſeen thy face, as though I had ſeen the face of God, and thou waſt pleaſed with me:</hi> Then, how much more ſhould we rejoyce in this aſſurance, that God hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of us, and that he is pleaſed with us! If the Apoſtle (<hi>Rom.</hi> 15.3.) prayed ſo earneſtly, and deſired others to ſtrive with him in prayer to God, that his ſervice, which he had for <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> might be accepted of the Saints; then how much more ſhould we pray, that our ſervices may be accepted of God, and rejoyce when they are accepted! The Apoſtle made it his chief work, to get acceptation with God (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.9.) <hi>Wherefore we labour, that whether preſent or abſent</hi> (that is, whether living or dying) <hi>we may be accepted with him;</hi> we are ambitious of divine acceptation. The word which we tranſlate <hi>labour,</hi> noteth a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring after honour, which ambitious men labour much after, implying that to be accepted with the Lord is a very high honour, indeed the higheſt honour.</p>
                  <pb n="897" facs="tcp:48669:462"/>
                  <p>There is a two-fold acceptation. Firſt, Of our perſons. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Of our ſervices. The former is the ground of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and Jeſus Chriſt is the foundation of both (<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.6.) <hi>He through glorious grace hath made us accepted in the beloved.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt is ſo dearly beloved of the father, that he is called, <hi>The Beloved,</hi> as if only beloved.

                     </gap>d fixed in the family of <hi>Aaron,</hi> ſhould be accepted in the work of his hands, was a bleſſing not only to himſelf, but to many more. This <hi>David</hi> prayed earneſtly for (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.14.) <hi>Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy ſight, O Lord, my ſtrength, and my redeemer.</hi> He put up a like prayer (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.108.) <hi>Accept, I beſeech thee, the free-will-offerings of my mouth, O Lord.</hi> This was the prayer of <hi>Araunah</hi> for <hi>David</hi> (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.23.) <hi>The Lord thy God accept thee.</hi> So great a priviledge it is, for our perſons and ſervices, to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted with the Lord; that when once we have it, we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce all our days (<hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.7,) <hi>Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry heart, for God now accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thy works. Solomon</hi> doth not mean it of a ſenſitive joy only, much leſs of any ſenſual joy, but of a gracious and ſpiritual joy. In this joy we may eat and drink, when our work is accepted; and our work is never accepted, till our perſons are.</p>
                  <p>Now, if it be ſo great a priviledge to be accepted with the Lord, how great a miſery is it not to be accepted? this inference floweth naturally from that great truth. And how great a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it is, not to be accepted of God, ſeveral Scriptures hold out. The Prophet (<hi>Amos</hi> 5.22,) declareth no other judgment upon that people but this, <hi>The Lord accepteth them not.</hi> And the ſame declaration is made by ſeveral other Prophets (<hi>Jerem.</hi> 14.10, 12. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 8.13. <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.8, 10.) Acceptance is our greateſt mercy, and non-acceptance our greateſt miſery; and that's the
<pb n="898" facs="tcp:48669:463"/> reaſon why the underſtanding and faithful ſervants of God are ſo ſtrict, or (as the world accounts it) preciſe and ſcrupleous, that they will not turn aſide, no not in thoſe things which are called ſmall matters, and of which many think God will take no notice. They deſire to be accepted of God in every thing, and becauſe they know (in ſome meaſure) what is acceptable to him, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they would do nothing, no, not the leaſt thing, which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceptable to him (<hi>Prov.</hi> 10.32.) <hi>The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable.</hi> The lips are organs or inſtruments of ſpeech, not of knowledge; the underſtanding knoweth, the lips only ſpeak: Yet here <hi>Solomon</hi> aſcribes the work of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſting to the lips; and this he doth, becauſe there is or ſhould be a great cognation, between the underſtanding and the lips; we ſhould ſpeak nothing but what we underſtand, we ſhould ſpeak only what we know, and according to our knowledge. The lips of the righteous have ſuch an intercourſe with their underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that their very lips may be ſaid to know what is acceptable, and therefore they ſpeak what is acceptable. It is ſaid of <hi>David,</hi> that he <hi>guided the people with the skilfulneſs</hi> (ſaith our) with the <hi>diſcretion</hi> (ſaith another tranſlation) with the <hi>underſtanding of his hands,</hi> ſaith the original (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.72.) The hand hath no more underſtanding, skill, or diſcretion ſeated in it, than the lips; yet becauſe <hi>David</hi> conſulted with his underſtanding, in what he did with his hand, it is ſaid, <hi>He guided them by the</hi> skilfulneſs, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, or <hi>underſtanding of his hand.</hi> Thus the <hi>lips of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> underſtand and <hi>know what is acceptable;</hi> and they know that unleſs they have an aime to honour God in ſmall matters, yea, in all matters, they greatly diſhonour him, and ſo cannot be accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him at all. The excellency of a gracious heart, appears greatly when he maketh conſcience of doing the leaſt thing which he knows, ye, only fears, will be unacceptable to God, or where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he may run the hazard of this priviledge, his acceptation with him.</p>
                  <p>There are three things, which ſhew why it is ſo great a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, to be accepted with God, and why his ſervants are ſo careful not to do any thing that is unacceptable unto him.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe, <hi>Once accepted with God and always accepted.</hi> For though poſſibly a perſon accepted may have ſome frowns from
<pb n="899" facs="tcp:48669:463"/> God upon his uneven walkings, or ſinful actings; yet his ſtate of acceptation, continues firm in the main. The Lord doth not ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly caſt off his favourites, no, nor any whom he taketh into his favour, or a nearneſs with himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>If we are once accepted with God, he can make us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted with men;</hi> and that, not only with good men (<hi>Rom.</hi> 14.18.) but, even with bad men. God can give us favour in the eyes of thoſe men, who have not an eye to ſee, that we are in his favour. <hi>Daniel,</hi> who was ſo careful to keep up his acceptation with God, <hi>That he purpoſed in his heart, not to defile himſelf with the portion of the Kings meat</hi> (Dan. 1.8, 9.) Of him it is ſaid (<hi>ver.</hi> 9.) <hi>God had brought</hi> Daniel <hi>into favour and tender love, with the Prince of the</hi> Eunuches. He, a conſcientious <hi>Jew,</hi> had great acceptation with him, who was an idolatrous Heathen.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If once accepted of the Lord, we need not be much troubled, though we are reprobate to the world, though the world reject and caſt us off, yea, caſt us out. The Lords acceptation of us, will bear or may bear up our ſpirits, in the midſt of the worlds reproaches, repulſes, and rejections.</p>
                  <p>Again, When the Lord ſaith, <hi>Him will I accept.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Obſerve;
<q>The Lord accepts ſome godly men more than others.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jobs</hi> three friends were godly men, queſtionleſs they were, yet they had not that acceptation with God which <hi>Job</hi> had. All that are godly have acceptation with God, but they have not all alike acceptation (<hi>Acts</hi> 10.35.) <hi>In every Nation, they that fear him and work righteouſneſs, are accepted with him:</hi> Which we muſt not take meerly for a moral or legal righteouſneſs, but as in conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with an Evangelical righteouſneſs. Now let them be who they will, <hi>that fear God and work righteouſneſs, they are accepted:</hi> but all are not equally accepted; <hi>him will I accept,</hi> ſaith the Lord concerning <hi>Job,</hi> with <hi>an Emphaſis;</hi> why was it ſo? becauſe <hi>Job</hi> was one of the moſt eminent perſons for godlineſs, yea, the moſt eminent, at that time, upon the face of the whole earth, as was ſhewed at the 2d verſe of the firſt chapter. <hi>Noah</hi> was a man highly accepted of the Lord above others, and he was righteous above others (<hi>Gen.</hi> 7.1.) <hi>Thee</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>have I ſeen righteous before me in this generation.</hi> Poſſibly there might be others
<pb n="900" facs="tcp:48669:464"/> righteous, but there was no man ſo righteous as <hi>Noah,</hi> and none ſo accepted as he.</p>
                  <p>And if it be enquired, who amongſt good men are moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, or accepted beyond other good men? I anſwer,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, They among good men are moſt accepted, who <hi>live moſt by faith.</hi> As <hi>without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God,</hi> in any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree (<hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6.) ſo they that live moſt by faith, pleaſe God moſt, or in the higheſt degree, and are moſt accepted by him. <hi>Abraham,</hi> who lived ſo much by faith, that he was called <hi>the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the faithful,</hi> was ſo much accepted of God, that he is called <hi>The friend of God (Jam.</hi> 2.23.)</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Among godly men, they who are moſt upright in their walkings, who walk with a ſingle eye, and with a right foot, are moſt acceptable; ſuch a man was <hi>Job.</hi> The character given him (Chap. 1.1.) was, A man <hi>perfect and upright.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>They that walk moſt humbly, are moſt acceptable unto God.</hi> For, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>God reſiſteth the proud, and giveth grace to the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble (Jam.</hi> 4.6.) ſo he ſheweth <hi>grace,</hi> that is, <hi>favour,</hi> or graceth and adorneth them with his favours. When one ſaid (<hi>Mich.</hi> 6.6.) <hi>Wherewith ſhall I come before the Lord?</hi> &amp;c. The Prophet an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered (<hi>verſ.</hi> 8.) <hi>He hath ſhewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do juſtly, and to love mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and to walk humbly with thy God?</hi> That is, as he requireth of thee to exerciſe juſtice toward all men, and mercy to the poor, or any in miſery, ſo to walk humbly with himſelf; that is, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge thou haſt need of the righteouſneſs of a Saviour, and of the mercy of a God, how much righteouſneſs and mercy ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thou haſt exerciſed towards others. When we are low in our own eyes, then are we higheſt in Gods eye; when we, as it were, reject our ſelves, and all that we have done, as unworthy of any acceptation, then are we moſt accepted of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Among Believers, they are moſt accepted with God, who are moſt fruitful in their lives, and do moſt good in their places, and according to their opportunities. The Lord loveth a fruitful Chriſtian. Many are barren trees, unfruitful ground, little can be ſeen of good which they do; theſe are a burden to God. But, when a Chriſtian (as it is ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.38.) <hi>goeth about doing good;</hi> when a Chriſtian, as Chriſt giveth the account of his own life (<hi>John</hi> 17.4.) <hi>Glorifieth God on earth, and finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="901" facs="tcp:48669:464"/> the work which God gives him to do,</hi> O how acceptable is ſuch a one to God! And therefore,</p>
                  <p>Let us labour to know, and do what is acceptable to the Lord. The Apoſtle would have us <hi>prove what is acceptable to the Lord (Eph.</hi> 5.10.) that is, Firſt, ſtudy the Word, to find out what is acceptable to the Lord. Secondly, approve and embrace with our whole hearts, what we find to be ſo. Thirdly, practice and do what we have ſo approved or embraced. And becauſe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſpeaks of ſome duties which are ſpecially acceptable to the Lord, I ſhall inſtance the Point in a few particulars.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Doing right to every one (<hi>Prov.</hi> 21.3.) <hi>To do juſtice and judgement, is more acceptable to the Lord than ſacrifice.</hi> This is true, or may be affi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>med of juſtice, both commutative and diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. To do juſtice in our dealings with men, called <hi>commutative juſtice,</hi> is more acceptable than ſacrifice, that is, than any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward worſhip given to God without this. 'Tis true alſo, of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributive juſtice, which is done by Magiſtrates in rewarding good men, and in puniſhing them that do evil; theſe works of juſtice alſo, are more acceptable to the Lord than ſacrifice.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The true worſhip and ſervice of God, which the Apoſtle calls <hi>ſacrifice,</hi> is highly acceptable to God (<hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1.) <hi>I beſeech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye preſent your bodies a living ſacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reaſonable ſervice.</hi> Theſe firſt Table-duties, when in conſort with thoſe former ſecond Table-duties, are highly honourable, and therefore cannot but be highly acceptable to the Lord. Sacrifice to God, without juſtice to man, is meer hypocriſie; Juſtice to man, without ſacrifice to God, is no better than Heatheniſh mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality: Both united, are the beauty of Chriſtianity.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, To ſerve Chriſt, that is, to aim at the honouring, as well as the enjoying of Chriſt, with our Goſpel-priviledges and liberties, is exceeding acceptable. The Apoſtle having ſaid (<hi>Rom.</hi> 14.17.) <hi>The Kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and peace, and joy in the holy Ghoſt,</hi> preſently adds (<hi>verſ.</hi> 18.) <hi>He that in theſe things</hi> (that is, in righteouſneſs, and peace, and joy in the holy Ghoſt) <hi>ſerveth Chriſt, is acceptable unto God;</hi> that is, this ſhews he is a perſon accepted with God. The do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of things purely acceptable to God, is a clear and ſtrong argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our acceptation with him.</p>
                  <pb n="902" facs="tcp:48669:465"/>
                  <p>Fourthly, To do any good we do, be it little or much, with a willing mind, is very acceptable to God (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.12.) <hi>If there be firſt a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man hath.</hi> Though it be little that we have, yet if the mind be free, if there be much of the will in it, though but little of the purſe (if we have no more to give, or give according to what we have) if there be much of the heart in it, though but little of the hand (if we do according to the power that is in our hand) the Lord hath a very great reſpect to it.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, To be much in prayer for others, eſpecially for thoſe that are in power over us, is very acceptable to the Lord (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.2, 3.) <hi>I exhort that ſupplications,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>be made for all men, for Kings, and all that are in authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life, in all godlineſs and honeſty; for this is good and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table in the ſight of God our Saviour.</hi> As it is good and acceptable in the ſight of God, that we ſhould lead a quiet and peaceable life, in all godlineſs and honeſty, under Kings and all in authority; ſo that we ſhould pray for Kings, and thoſe that are in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>When children do well requite their parents;</hi> that (ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.4.) <hi>is acceptable unto God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Seventhly, To ſuffer patiently for well-doing, is greatly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing unto God (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20.) In a word, they among good men are moſt acceptable of God, who are moſt zealous in doing any thing in a right manner, which for the matter is acceptable unto God.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve, Thirdly;
<q>As the Lord accepteth ſome godly men more than others, ſo he accepteth ſome godly men for others.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Lord doth not ſpeak here of accepting <hi>Job</hi> ſtrictly for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but of his acceptation in the behalf of his friends, <hi>Him will I accept,</hi> that is, <hi>for you;</hi> I will be intreated by him, I will not give you the honour to be intreated by you, but to him I give it, I will be intreated by him. The Prophet <hi>Eliſha</hi> ſaid to the King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (2 <hi>Kings</hi> 3.14.) <hi>Were it not that I regard the preſence of</hi> Jehoſhaphat <hi>the King of</hi> Judah, <hi>I would not look toward thee, nor ſee thee;</hi> he would not vouchſafe that bad King a look, but for the reſpect that he bare to good <hi>Jehoſhaphat.</hi> And it is a truth,
<pb n="903" facs="tcp:48669:465"/> that God would not have ſo much reſpect to ſome good men, were it not for the ſake of ſome others, who are better. Yet, that the Lord accepts one mans perſon more than anothers, or one mans perſon for another, is primarily and principally, in and for the ſake of Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Job</hi> had acceptation with God more than his friends, and for his friends; he had the former by his being in Chriſt, and the latter as he was a figure of Chriſt. No mans perſon, no mans work is accepted of, otherwiſe than in relation to Chriſt. The Apoſtle affirms this fully (<hi>Eph.</hi> 1.6.) <hi>He hath made us accepted in the Beloved.</hi> Chriſtians are <hi>beloved,</hi> but Chriſt only is <hi>the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved:</hi> we are accepted in him, <hi>the beloved,</hi> as to our ſelves; and 'tis in <hi>the beloved</hi> that any are accepted more than others, or for others.</p>
                  <p>Take this Inference from the whole.</p>
                  <q>The Lord accepted <hi>Job</hi> praying for others; then he will accept a good man praying upon right grounds, and for right ends, againſt another.</q>
                  <p>It is dangerous to ſtand in the way of their prayers, who are accepted of God. <hi>That man is more ſafe, againſt whom a thouſand are acting, than he againſt whom any one godly man upon a juſt ground is praying.</hi> The Lord hath done great things againſt evil men, upon the prayers of the faithful, as well as he hath done great things for good men at their prayer. <hi>David</hi> by one ejacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latory petition, ſpoyled the plot of <hi>Achitophel;</hi> the Lord, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that ſhort prayer, turned his counſel into fooliſhneſs, and ſo overturned the whole deſign laid againſt his ſervant <hi>David.</hi> Thus far of the promiſe, which the Lord gave <hi>Eliphaz</hi> and his two friends for their encouragement, to go unto <hi>Job</hi> and entreat him to offer up a burnt-offering, and to pray for them, <hi>for him will I accept.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now followeth a threat, in caſe they did not:
<q>Leſt I deal with you according to your folly.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>As if the Lord had ſaid, <hi>Do not ſlight this advice that I give you, no, nor forſlow it, make haſt to make your addreſs to</hi> Job; <hi>I will accept him, and I tell you, I will not accept you alone; therefore make haſt, and do as I have commanded, elſe</hi>
                     <q>I ſhall deal with you according to your folly.</q>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="904" facs="tcp:48669:466"/>
                  <p>There is ſome difference in the reading of theſe words.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Some read, <hi>Leſt I do or act folly to you.</hi> But how can the Lord do or act folly towards any? We may expound this tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by that (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.26.) where <hi>David</hi> ſaith of the Lord, <hi>With the pure thou wilt ſhew thy ſelf pure, and with the froward or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, thou wilt ſhew thy ſelf froward or perverſe.</hi> But how doth the Lord ſhew himſelf froward with thoſe that are froward? there is no frowardneſs in the Lord, he is alwayes in a compoſed and ſedate frame, infinitely beyond any paſſion or perturbation: the meaning is only this, The Lord will deal with men according to what they are; the actings and effects of his providence ſhall be towards a froward man, as if he were froward. If a man deal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſely with God, he will deal with him as if he were perverſe; <hi>and with the pure, God will ſhew himſelf pure,</hi> that is, he will car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it purely towards them; they ſhall receive good, who are and do good. Thus here, go, ſaith the Lord, and do as I bid you, <hi>Leſt I deal folly to you.</hi> In the Hebrew Language, to do kindneſs with one, is the ſame as to exerciſe or ſhew kindneſs to him. That form of ſpeech is uſed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 20.13. <hi>Gen.</hi> 24.49. <hi>Gen.</hi> 40.14. And ſo to do folly with one, is to ſhew or exerciſe folly to to him. The Lord doth folly to them that do folly; that is, he makes them ſee by his wiſe doing, how fooliſhly they have done.</p>
                  <p>Others expreſs it thus, <hi>Leſt I deal fooliſhly with you,</hi> or, <hi>folly to you;</hi> that is, leſt I do that which may be accounted fooliſhneſs in me. You having appeared Advocates in my cauſe, and pleaded for me ('tis folly to pay any man with unkindneſs for the ſervice he hath done us.) Well (ſaith the Lord) look to it, I will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept you, but deal folly to you, or fooliſhly with you, in the ſenſe of ſome men (poſſibly) but wiſely in my own. The Lord is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to be admired, in his wiſdom, holineſs, and in the ſerenity of his ſpirit; yet in the opinion of the wiſe men of this world, he may ſeem to deal fooliſhly, or do folly.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The words may be rendred, <hi>Leſt I do that which may be diſgraceful to you.</hi> Thus the <hi>Chaldee</hi> paraphraſe readeth, <hi>Leſt I put a diſgrace, or an affront upon you,</hi> and make it appear, <hi>to your ſhame,</hi> that you have not carried it aright in this matter, but have been ſhamefully out. The word here uſed, is ſeveral times uſed in Scripture, to note the defiling or diſgrace of a thing
<pb n="905" facs="tcp:48669:466"/> (<hi>Nahum.</hi> 3.6.) <hi>I will caſt abominable filth upon thee, and I will make thee vile,</hi> that is, I will diſgrace thee, and (as it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) <hi>I will ſet thee for a gazing ſtock.</hi> So (<hi>Micah</hi> 7.6.) when the Lord would ſhew the exceeding ſinfulneſs of thoſe times, he ſaith, <hi>Truſt ye not in a friend, put ye not confidence in a guide, keep the door of thy mouth from her that lyeth in thy boſom; for the ſon diſhonoureth the father;</hi> it is this word, the ſon diſgraceth the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he dealeth with his father as if he were a <hi>Nabal,</hi> a very fool. When a ſon knoweth not his diſtance, nor performeth his dury, he diſhonoureth his father.

<pb n="906" facs="tcp:48669:467"/> As if the Lord had ſaid, Leſt I make you underſtand by your ſad experiences, by the puniſhments and chaſtiſements laid upon you, that you have done very fooliſhly, and were greatly miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in your apprehenſions of me, and of my providences con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Job.</hi> Or thus, ye have declared much folly in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of this matter with my ſervant <hi>Job,</hi> ye have offended againſt the common Laws of friendſhip and humanity, inſulting over a man in miſery; and your folly hath been greater, while, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Laws of piety, ye have judged of a mans holineſs, by his outward unhappineſs, and have cenſured him as a bad man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath in this world endured ſo much evil. This hath been your ſin, ye have in this dealt fooliſhly with my ſervant <hi>Job;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore haſten to him, and do as I have ſaid, <hi>Leſt I deal with you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>according to your folly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note, Firſt;
<q>Sin is folly.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And not only is it ſimple folly, which a man committeth for want of wit, or becauſe he hath little underſtanding (what a man doth for want of wit and underſtanding, is <hi>ſimple folly</hi>) but ſin is <hi>wicked folly,</hi> which is the abuſe of wit, and parts, and gifts, yea, the overflowing of luſt. And though we cannot charge theſe men, that they did intentionally uſe their wit and parts to grieve <hi>Job,</hi> yet it proved ſo; though it was not the end or deſign of them that ſpake, yet it was the iſſue of their ſpeech; they did him a great deal of wrong, and doubtleſs, Satan ſtirred much, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked them to uſe their parts and gifts to imbitter the ſpirit of the poor man, and God left them to do it. This was their folly; and all ſuch actings or ſpeakings are no better, nor do they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve better or ſofter language. This word <hi>folly,</hi> is often applied in Scripture, to ſin, eſpecially to great ſins. Another word is uſed in the <hi>Proverbs</hi> of <hi>Solomon;</hi> but in ſeveral other places, ſin is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by this (<hi>Gen</hi> 34.7.)

<pb n="907" facs="tcp:48669:467"/> 
                     <hi>villany (Jer.</hi> 29.23.) All ſin is folly, eſpecially any great ſin is ſo. For,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It is a folly to hurt our ſelves. No man can hurt us, if we do not hurt our ſelves by ſin. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith (1 Epiſt. 3.13.) <hi>Who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is good?</hi> 'Tis ſtrange, that any ſhould. Though it be true e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that many have had, not only a will to harm them that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low good, but have actually done them many and great outward harms; yet this is a great truth, none can indeed harm them that follow good, becauſe all harms turn to their good. Nothing can hurt us but our ſin.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Sin is folly, for in ſinning we ſtrive with one that is too hard for us. <hi>Do we</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.23.) <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the Lord to jealouſie?</hi> (are we ſo ſimple?) <hi>are we ſtronger than he?</hi>

                  <p>Thirdly, It is folly to do that by which we can get no good, that's the part of a fool (<hi>Rom.</hi> 6.21.) <hi>What fruit have ye of thoſe things whereof ye are now aſhamed?</hi> What have ye got by them? have ye made any gains or earnings to boaſt of? <hi>the end of thoſe things is death;</hi> &amp; is it not folly to begin that which ends in death, and that a never-ending, an eternal death.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, It is folly to ſin, for by that, at beſt, we run a hazard of our beſt portion, for fading pleaſures, and periſhing profits. If we have any pleaſure by ſin, it is but pleaſure for a ſeaſon, and that a very ſhort one too. What a fooliſh thing is it to venture things that are incorruptable, for periſhing things? It were a great folly for a man to venture gold againſt graſs: they do infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more fooliſhly who ſin againſt the Lord; for all that they can get by it, is not ſo much, to what they hazard, as graſs to gold (<hi>Mat.</hi> 16.26.) <hi>What is a man profited, if he ſhall gain the whole world, and loſe his own ſoul? or what ſhall a man give in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change for his ſoul?</hi> As all fleſh is graſs, ſo all that fleſh luſteth after is no better. What kind of Merchants, what kind of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change-men are they, that will traffick or truck away their ſouls, for the profits or pleaſures of ſin? and 'tis for one of theſe that moſt, if not all men, traffick away their ſouls.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, Obſerve;
<q>When God dealeth m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ſt ſeverely with ſinners, he dealeth juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>What rod ſoever he layeth upon their backs, what ſhame, what poverty, what ſickneſs he affl cts them with, <hi>It is but according to their folly,</hi> they have but their own, they have no reaſon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain. The Prophet told the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as one man, when under grievous affl ctions (<hi>Jerem.</hi> 4.18.) <hi>Thy ways and thy doings, have procured theſe things unto thee:</hi> Thou haſt no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to complain, for thy puniſhment is of thy own procurement, that is, thy ſin is viſible in thy puniſhment, thou eateſt but the fruit of thy own doings, how bitter ſoever it is. Another Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaith (<hi>Num.</hi> 32.23.) <hi>Your ſin ſhall find you out,</hi> that is, you ſhall ſuffer according to what you have done, and reap what ye have ſowed. And is it not folly to <hi>ſow to the</hi> (corrupt) <hi>fleſh, when of the fleſh we ſhall reap corruption</hi> (Gal. 6.8.) The fleſh is a corrupt thing, and can yield us no better a thing than it is (the effect is like the cauſe) <hi>corruption,</hi> that is, a miſerable condition both here and hereafter, now and for ever.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Note;
<q>The Lord will not paſs by, nor ſpare, no not a godly man, when he ſinneth and repenteth not.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>All this is included in the going of theſe men to <hi>Job.</hi> As if the Lord had ſaid, <hi>I will puniſh you</hi> Eliphaz, <hi>and</hi> Bildad, <hi>and</hi> Zophar <hi>for your folly, unleſs ye repent.</hi> They that are in a ſtate of grace, cannot expect favour from the Lord, unleſs they turn from their ſin, and give him glory by repenting and believing. Good men doing evil may ſuffer for it, as well as the worſt of men. The Lord will ſee a work of repentance and ſel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>-hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, a work of faith, looking to Chriſt the ſacrifice, elſe he will deal with them, even with them (as he threatned theſe good men) <hi>according to their folly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But what was the folly of <hi>Eliphaz</hi> and his two friends, for which the Lord threatned to deal ſo ſeverely with them? The latter part of the verſe tells us, what God accounted and called <hi>their folly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <pb n="909" facs="tcp:48669:468"/>In that ye have not ſpoken of me the thing that is right.</q>
                  <p>The Lord had told them as much at the ſeventh verſe, <hi>My wrath is kindled againſt you, becauſe ye have not ſpoken of me the thing that is right.</hi> Here the Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d pointeth them to their ſin again, and layeth his finger afreſh upon the ſoar.</p>
                  <p>But why doth he ſo?</p>
                  <p>Take theſe three reaſons why. Probably the Lord repeated theſe words,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To ſhew that he was very ſenſible of their ſin, in ſpeaking amiſs of him, and very angry with them for it. They provoked the Lord much, when they meaſured him, as it were by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or by their own meet-wand, in his ways of judgment, and procedure with <hi>Job;</hi> and therefore they muſt hear of it a ſecond time, or (as we ſay) at both ears.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Lord telleth them again of it, that he might faſten the ſenſe of their ſin more upon them. We very hardly take the impreſſion of our follies and failings, we are ready to let the thoughts of them wear off and ſlip from us; they abide not, but glide away as water from a ſtone, or from the ſwans-back, unleſs fixed by renewed mindings: and for this reaſon the Lord repeateth the mention of ſin ſo often, in the the ears of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, by the miniſtry of his word, that the evil of it may more fully appear to them, or that they may the more clearly ſee, and the better know how bad, how baſe, how fooliſh a thing it is to ſin againſt him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I conceive, the Lord repeated theſe words, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the judgment which he had given before concerning them in thoſe wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> As if the Lord had ſaid, that which I ſaid before, I ſay again, I do not change my opinion, either concerning you or my ſervant <hi>Job;</hi> and therefore, I ſay it once more (the rep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ting of a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is for the confirmation of it, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> told <hi>Pharaoh</hi> about the doubling of his dream.) <hi>Ye have not ſpoken of me the thing that is right,</hi>
                     <q>Like my ſervant <hi>Job.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe words alſo are a repetition, yea, a triplication, and more than ſo, this is the fourth time, that the Lord hath called
<pb n="910" facs="tcp:48669:469"/> Job <hi>his ſervant,</hi> in the compaſs of two verſes, three times in this 8th verſe, and once in the 7th.</p>
                  <p>But what ſhould be the meaning of this? why did the Lord call <hi>Job</hi> his ſervant ſo often, even four times, as it were in one breath?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, Firſt, It intimates that <hi>Job</hi> was the Lords ſteady ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, that what he was at firſt he was then at laſt, and what he had been long ago he was ſtill. Some have been called the ſervants of God, who have given it over in the plain field; but here the Lord calleth <hi>Job</hi> his ſervant, <hi>over and over,</hi> four times over, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſure ſervant.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It was to ſhew that as <hi>Job</hi> retained the ſame duty and reſpect to the ſervice of God, ſo God retained the ſame opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Job,</hi> and of his ſervice then as at firſt.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Lord in repeating this relational title, <hi>ſervant,</hi> ſo often, would aſſure us that he knew not how (if I may ſpeak ſo) to ſpeak more honourably of him. The Lord gave no other title to <hi>Moſes</hi> (Num. 12.7.) nor to <hi>Caleb</hi> (Num. 14.24) nor to <hi>David</hi> (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.5, 8.) The Lord did not ſpeak this ſo often, becauſe he wanted other titles to give him, or becauſe he had not variety of phraſes to expreſs himſelf by, but as if he knew not where to find a more honourable title. I grant that title of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, <hi>Son,</hi> is more noble, and more endearing; but that is not at all ſpoken of in the Old Teſtament, nor is it given to any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſon in the New. Believers, as to their ſtate, are all the ſons of God; but no one believer is ſpoken, either to, or of, under this title, <hi>Son.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſtill called himſelf only a ſervant of God. He that is the Lords ſervant, is the beſt of free-men. We have enough to glory in, when we are his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. The Hiſtory reports of the <hi>French King,</hi> That the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador of the King of <hi>Spain</hi> repeating many great titles of his Maſter; the King of <hi>France</hi> commanded this only to be menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned of him, <hi>King of France, King of France;</hi> implying, that this ſingle title <hi>King of France,</hi> was as honourable as that large roll of titles given the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> Thus the Lord calleth Job <hi>his ſervant, his ſervant, his ſervant,</hi> to ſhew that all honour is wrapt up in this word, <hi>A ſervant of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, This repetition may ſignifie, That <hi>Job</hi> had been a very great, good, and faithful ſervant to the Lord; not only a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
<pb n="911" facs="tcp:48669:469"/> but a laborious and profitable ſervant to the Lord; ſo the Scripture calls thoſe who are laborious in his ſervice, though at beſt, as to the Lord, we are unprofitable ſervants, nor can any be profitable unto him.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, The Lord multiplieth this title upon him, becauſe whatſoever a godly man doth, is ſervice to the Lord. This word <hi>ſervice</hi> is comprehenſive of all duties; to <hi>hear the Word</hi> is, to ſerve the Lord; to pray, to faſt, to give almes, is to ſerve the Lord all is ſervice to the Lord.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Job</hi> was every way a ſervant of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, As <hi>he was a Ruler.</hi> To rule well in a family is to ſerve the Lord; to rule Nations is to ſerve the Lord much more. <hi>Job</hi> was a ruler, and he ruled well in both capacities, as was ſhewed in opening the 29th, 30th, and 31ſt chapters.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Job</hi> was a great ſervant of the Lord, as he was a <hi>worſhipper.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Job</hi> was a great ſervant of the Lord, as he was a <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificer;</hi> he had the honour of the prieſt-hood.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Job</hi> was a great ſervant of the Lord, as <hi>a teacher</hi> of the truth; he had <hi>inſtructed many,</hi> as <hi>Eliphaz</hi> acknowledged (<hi>chap.</hi> 4.3.) And as he was a great ſervant of the Lord in teaching the truth, ſo in oppoſing error; he ſtood firm to his own opinion (the truth) againſt the tenent of his friends.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>Job</hi> ſerved the Lord as he was a <hi>ſufferer.</hi> To ſuffer is very great ſervice, eſpecially (as he did) to ſuffer greatly. We ſerve the Lord as much with his croſs upon our backs, as with his yoke upon our necks, or his burden upon our ſhoulders. <hi>Job</hi> was a great ſervant of the Lords, as in holding forth the doctrine of the croſs, or maintaining that God afflicts his choiceſt ſervants; ſo in bearing the croſs himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>Job</hi> was a great ſervant of the Lord in praying for his friends, and in being ſo willing to be reconciled to them; and therefore, the Lord having had ſo many ſervices of him, and ſo many ways, repeateth, <hi>my ſervant</hi> Job, <hi>my ſervant</hi> Job, as if he could not ſay this word often enough, <hi>My ſervant</hi> Job.</p>
                  <p>Thus we have the Lords command or charge given to <hi>Eliphaz</hi> and his two friends, what they muſt do for the quenching of that fire which was kindled in his breaſt againſt them, for their folly in
<pb n="912" facs="tcp:48669:470"/> dealing with his ſe vant <hi>Job.</hi> How they anſwered that command, will appear in the next words.</p>

                  <p>This verſe holds out the obedience of <hi>Eliphaz</hi> and his two friends, to the charge and command which the Lord gave them in the eighth verſe; where the Lord ſaid to theſe three men, <hi>Take to you ſeven bullocks and ſeven rams, and go to my ſervant</hi> Job, <hi>and offer up for your ſelves a burnt offering, &amp;c.</hi> This Text an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth that command, they <hi>went, and did according as the Lord commanded them.</hi> Their obedience to the Lords command is deſcribed three wayes.</p>

                  <p>Having received a command to go, they did not tarry and ſtay to co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="913" facs="tcp:48669:470"/> was ſaid) the ſpeedineſs of their obedience, they went preſently; ſecondly, the willingneſs of their obedience, their minds were in the work, as well as their bodies; thirdly, the cheerfulneſs of their obedience, they went as if they had been to take a pleaſing or pleaſant Journey. <hi>They went;</hi> and what did they? <hi>They went</hi>
                     <q>And did according as the Lord commanded them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Their obedience was not only ſpeedy, and willing, and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but exact. Theſe words, <hi>They did according as the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them,</hi> yield us a great example of full, of compleat obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; they not only did what was commanded, but they did it as it was commanded, yea, and they did it becauſe it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,<note place="margin">Singulare e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> for that muſt come in to make up the fulneſs of our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. Here is then a great example of humility, of modeſty, of meekneſs, and of ſubmiſſion to the will of God, <hi>They went and did according as the Lord commanded them.</hi> What was that? They brought their ſacrifice, firſt, for kind, and ſecondly, for number, as the Lord had commanded them: The Lord commanded them to bring <hi>Bullocks and Rams;</hi> they brought them: The Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to bring ſeven Bullocks and ſeven Rams; they brought them as the Lord commanded, both for kind and for number.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, They brought them <hi>to Job.</hi> The Lord ſaid, <hi>Go to my ſervant Job;</hi> they went to <hi>Job</hi> according as the Lord commanded them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, We muſt ſuppoſe they intreated <hi>Job</hi> to undertake the Office of a Reconciler, of a Mediator, of a Prieſt, between God and them, according as the Lord commanded. Though this piece of their ſubmiſſion and obedience be not expreſſed, yet it is intimated and implyed; nor could it be omitted, it being not only a part, but the principal part, of that duty which the Lord laid upon them. Thus in all things they ſubmitted and were obedient according to the command of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, In that we have all three named here in this matter of obedience; <hi>Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite, went,</hi>

                  <p>Obſerve;
<q>It is very good in it ſelf, and very pleaſing to God, when they who have joyned in any ſin or miſcarriage towards him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf or others, joyn readily together in ſhewing their ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and repentance for it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was a bleſſed ſight to ſee thoſe three men coming as one man about this duty, not one of them drawing back, not one of them putting in any plea againſt the command of God. There are three things wherein it is very pleaſant to behold the people of God joyning in one.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, when they joyn or are one in Opinion and Judgment, when they all think the ſame thing, and are of one mind in the truth.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, When they joyne together and are one in affection, when they are all of one heart, though poſſibly they are not all of one mind, or, when they meet in affection, though not in opinion, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 133.1.) <hi>Behold how good and how pleaſant it is, for brethren to dwell together in unity!</hi> And when <hi>David</hi> had ſpoken admiringly of this goodly ſight, he ſpake declaratively concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the goodneſs of it (<hi>verſ.</hi> 2.) <hi>It is like the precious oyntment upon the head:</hi> 'Tis ſo, firſt, for the ſweetneſs of it; 'tis ſo, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, for the diffuſiveneſs of it (as followeth) <hi>that ran down upon the beard, even Aarons beard, that went down to the skirts of his garments.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>Firſt, in doing that which is good; or, when, as the Apoſtles word is (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.1.) they are (among themſelves) <hi>workers to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether</hi> in any good work; we ſay (to fill up the Text) <hi>workers together with God.</hi> That's a bleſſed ſight indeed, when we joyne with God, and God joyneth with us in his work: It is alſo a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſight, when all the Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt, and any as mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Jeſus Chriſt, joyn in any good work, in this eſpecially, to beſeech all we have to do with, <hi>that they receive not the grace of God in vain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, in turning from evil, and putting iniquity far from them; in praying for the pardon of ſin, and making their peace with God. In this work the three in the Text joyned together.
<pb n="915" facs="tcp:48669:471"/>
'Tis a good work to turn away from evil, eſpecially when all who are concerned in it joyn in it. <hi>A great mourning</hi> is propheſied (<hi>Zech.</hi> 12.11, 12, 13.) <hi>And the land ſhall mourn every family apart; the family of the houſe of David apart, and their wives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part; the family of the houſe of Nathan apart, and their wives apart; the Family of the houſe of Levi apart, and their Wives apart,</hi> &amp;c. Here's a great mourning with a turning from ſin propheſied of, as alſo the manner of it; <hi>Every family ſhall mourn apart:</hi> But though they ſhall mourn apart, yet they ſhall all joyn in mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; a whole family ſhall mourn apart, not a part of a family; and as the whole of a family ſhall mourn, ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ll the Families ſhall mourn and repent, and ſeek reconciliation to God, as if they were but one family, yea, but one perſon. As to joyn in ſin, and to be brethren in iniquity, is the worſt of unions, indeed a combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt God; ſo to joyn as Brethren in mourning for ſin, and repenting of our iniquities, is a bleſſed union, and highly pleaſing unto God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, In that it is ſaid, <hi>They went and did as the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Obſerve;
<q>When the Lord commandeth we muſt ſpeedily obey.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>We muſt make no excuſe, no delay, we may not diſpute the commands of God, nor may we at all excuſe our ſelves from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the commands of God: Theſe men did not ſo much as deſire to be excuſed; they ſaid not, it is true, we have failed, but it was through ignorance, or we had a good meaning in what we ſaid, we intended <hi>Job</hi> no hurt; may we not then be ſpared this coſt and trouble? we hear of none of this, but preſently they did as the Lord commanded. Though the command of the Lord be hard and very unpleaſing to fleſh and blood, yet we muſt ſpeedily obey it. The command which theſe men received was to fleſh and blood a hard command. Is it not hard to fleſh and blood,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, to confeſs that we have erred, and are out?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Is it not hard to fleſh and blood? goeth it not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the grain, to ſubmit to one whom we have wronged?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Is it not hard to fleſh and blood, to honour whom we have reproached and thought light of? All theſe are hard meat to fleſh and blood, and we can hardly digeſt them (as was toucht
<pb n="916" facs="tcp:48669:472"/> before) yet theſe men without diſputes and delays went about the work. <hi>Abraham</hi> received a hard command from God, a far harder command to fleſh and blood than theſe men received: For, Firſt, they received a command to go and offer bullocks and rams in ſacrifice; but <hi>Abraham</hi> was commanded to offer his Son in ſacrifice. Secondly, He was to offer his <hi>only Son;</hi> that was harder. Thirdly, He was to offer <hi>his only Son</hi> Iſaac, <hi>whom he loved.</hi> A man may have an only ſon, who is a vexation and a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to him: but as he was a ſon, and an only ſon, ſo a ſon whom <hi>Abraham</hi> greatly loved; yet God layed this hard and grievous command upon him, <hi>Go and offer up thy ſon, thine only ſon</hi> Iſaac, <hi>whom thou loveſt, upon one of the mountains that I ſhall ſhew thee</hi> (Gen. 22.2.) When <hi>Abraham</hi> had received this command from God, to offer up his ſon for a ſacrifice, as theſe had received a command to offer up beaſts in ſacrifice; What did <hi>Abraham? He roſe up early in the morning</hi> (ſaith the text) <hi>and ſadled his aſs, and took two of the young men with him, and</hi> Iſaac <hi>his ſon, and went unto the place which God had told him.</hi> As here theſe men went, ſo <hi>Abraham</hi> went, he did not linger, nor lye long in bed, but roſe up early in the morning. This was an amazing work of obedience to the command of God, a very hard and grievous command of God. <hi>Abraham</hi> had ſhewed an eminent act of obedience to the Lord, before this offering up of his ſon; when God called him out of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>r</hi> of the <hi>Caldees,</hi> he went. The Apoſtle ſaith (<hi>Heb.</hi> 11.8.) <hi>By faith</hi> Abraham <hi>when he was called, to go out into a place which he ſhould after receive for an inheritance, obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and he went out not knowing whither he went;</hi> he followed God as it were blind-fold. So the Apoſtle yeilded preſent obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, he made no diverſions, no ſtop; <hi>When it pleaſed God</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>who ſeparated me from my mothers womb, and called me by his grace, to reveal his ſon in me, that I might preach him amongſt the heathen; immediately I conferred not with fleſh and blood, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther went I up to</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>to them which were Apoſtles before me, but I went into</hi> Arabia, <hi>&amp;c. (Gal.</hi> 1.15, 16, 17.) <hi>He conferred not with fleſh and blood,</hi> that is, neither with his own heart, or with his own intereſt, what would be ſafeſt and beſt for him, nor did he go to conſult with other men who were fleſh and blood, but followed his call. Whatever God commands we have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do but to obey. As the Centurion ſaid (<hi>Mat.</hi> 8.9.) <hi>I am
<pb n="917" facs="tcp:48669:472"/> a man under authority, and I have ſouldiers under me; and I ſay to one, go, and he goeth; and to another, come, and he cometh; and to a third, do this, &amp; he doth it:</hi> Such an obedience are we to yeild to the commands of God. The Apoſtle giveth a like charge concerning ſervants, with reſpect to all their maſters lawful commands (<hi>Tit.</hi> 2.9.) Exhort ſervants to be obedient unto their own maſters, <hi>and to pleaſe them well in all things, not anſwering again,</hi> that is, <hi>not gain-ſaying,</hi> or not contradicting, as the word may be tranſlated. When a ſervant receiveth a juſt command from his maſter, he muſt not contradict, he muſt not put in his advice, thus or thus, but follow the orders given him. Now, if Maſters on earth ought to receive, in all lawful commands, ſuch obedience from their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, how much more is this due to our Lord and Maſter in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? eſpecially, if we conſider what the commands of the Lord are, under theſe three titles or attributes of them.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, They are all juſt and good. It is impoſſible for God to command that which is not right to be done, for his command maketh that right which is done, whatſoever it is; his will is righteouſneſs it ſelf, and the rule of it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, His commands are not only juſt and good in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but they are good to us, they are given for our profit and benefit, it is our intereſt as well as our duty to obey them. <hi>In keeping them there is great reward</hi> (Pſal. 19.11.) yea, the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them is a great reward. <hi>Do not my words</hi> (ſaith the Lord, <hi>Mic.</hi> 2.7.) <hi>do good to him that walketh uprightly?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The commands of the Lord are eaſie: That's the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles meaning, when he ſaith (1 <hi>John</hi> 5.3.) <hi>His commandements are not grievous.</hi> The Lord doth not put grievous things, nor heavy burdens upon his people. <hi>My yoke</hi> (ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.30.) <hi>is eaſie, and my burden light.</hi> Eaſie and light to a ſpiritual mind; to the new creature, though grievous to corruption, and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſome to the fleſh. Hard things are eaſie, and heavy things light to a ſutable mind; whereas eaſie things are hard, and light things heavy to a mind that is not ſo. Seing then the commands of the Lord are juſt in themſelves, good to us, and not grievous, he being our Soveraign, we ought ſpeedily to obey whatſoever he commands; and leaving off, or laying aſide all diſputes and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes, preſently fall upon the work which he at any time calleth
<pb n="918" facs="tcp:48669:473"/> us unto. This was commendable in <hi>Eliphaz</hi> and his two friends, <hi>They went and did as the Lord commanded them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Obſerve;
<q>The Lords commands muſt be done as he commandeth them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>We may do what the Lord commandeth, yet not as he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth. The Lords commands muſt be done, as we ſay to a hair, to a tittle, they muſt be done exactly: It is not enough to do what God commandeth, but according as he commandeth. The <hi>As</hi> is remarkable. Not only muſt we do good, but we muſt do it in a good way, that is, in Gods way. Firſt, The matter muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his command. Secondly, The manner muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his command; and this a two-fold manner. Firſt, the external manner muſt be as the Lord hath commanded. <hi>David</hi> bringing home the Arke (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.3.) they carried it on a new Cart, when it ſhould have been carryed upon the Levites ſhould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; that was a failing in the outward manner of that work. Hence that confeſſion of <hi>David,</hi> when he undertook that work a ſecond time (1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.13.) <hi>The Lord made a breach upon us at firſt, for that we ſought him not after the due order.</hi> We muſt worſhip God aright, for the outward manner of his commands and inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, elſe we diſhonour him, while we intend to worſhip him. Secondly, The inward manner muſt be according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God. 'Tis poſſible we may hit the outward form of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, yet miſs in the inward manner of it. The Lord ſearcheth the heart, he knoweth what is within, and muſt be <hi>worſhipped in ſpirit and in truth</hi> (John 4.24.) that is, according to the truth of the rule made known in the word, and in truth of heart. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward manner of worſhip is,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That we worſhip in faith; <hi>Without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God</hi> (Heb. 11.6.) If we have not a juſtifying faith, yea, if we have not a perſwading faith (<hi>Rom.</hi> 14.5, 23.) that what we do is according to the will of God, our worſhip i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> not according to what the Lord hath commanded, and ſo becomes ſin to us.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That we worſhip in love. Though we do never ſo many holy ſervices to the Lord, if we do them not in love to him, we fail in the inward manner of our worſhip. The ſum of all the Lords commands, is, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy ſoul, and with all
<pb n="919" facs="tcp:48669:473"/> thy might.</hi> It is not hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ing and praying, but theſe in love, which is the fulfilling of the commandement. Every duty muſt be mixt alſo with love to man. We may do many things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to men, yet, if we do them not in love to men, we do nothing as the Lord commandeth. Thus the holy Apoſtle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded peremptorily (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.1.) <hi>Though I ſpeak with the tongue of men and angels,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and have not charity, I am become as ſounding braſs, or a tinkling cimbal; and though I beſtow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burnt, and have not charity, it profiteth nothing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, To do all that the Lord commands according to the inward manner, is to do all in humility; that is, Firſt, Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging that we have no power of our own to do any thing; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, That we have deſerved nothing, how much ſoever we have done, or how well ſoever we have done it.</p>
                  <p>Thus in doing the Lords commands we ſhould labour to anſwer the mind of the Lord fully, and to hit every circumſtance, to omit nothing, no not the leſt thing. <hi>Moſes</hi> (Exod. 10.16.) being to carry the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> would not compound the matter with <hi>Pharaoh:</hi> Ye may go ſaid <hi>Pharaoh</hi> (after he had been broken by ſeveral plagues) <hi>Only let your little ones ſtay;</hi> no, ſaith <hi>Moſes,</hi> that is not as the Lord hath commanded me. And at another time, he ſaid, <hi>Go, only let your cattle ſtay;</hi> no, ſaith <hi>Moſes,</hi> this is not as the Lord commanded, I will not leave ſo much as a hoof behind me. And ſo ſaid <hi>Moſes</hi> concerning the obſervances of the law, For, <hi>thus I am commanded,</hi> or this is as the Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d commanded, as we read all along the books of <hi>Exodus</hi> and <hi>Leviticus.</hi> We are not full in our obedience, till we obey fully. It is ſaid of <hi>Caleb</hi> (Num. 14.24.) <hi>He had another ſpirit, he followed the Lord fully,</hi> that is, as to matter and manner, as to out-ſide and in-ſide. Let us labour to be full followers of God; not out-ſide followers of God only, but in-ſide followers. Let us not reſt in the in-ſide, when we are not right in the out-ſide, nor pleaſe our ſelves with an out-ſide ſervice, when we are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of the inward. Thus of their obedience, as conſidered in general, <hi>They did according as the Lord commanded.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Further, conſider their doing <hi>as the Lord commanded</hi> them in that ſpecial matter, their reconciliation, firſt to himſelf, and then to <hi>Job.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="920" facs="tcp:48669:474"/>
                  <p>Hence Obſerve, Fourthly;
<q>What the Lord appointeth for our reconciliation, we muſt do, and we muſt do it as he hath appointed.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>

They who are aſhamed of ſin, will not be aſhamed to acknowledge their ſin. But what muſt we do to be reconciled to God or ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>?</p>
                  <p>They who deſire reconcilion with God, muſt go out of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and go to Jeſus Chriſt; they muſt (as <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> &amp;c. did) bring a ſacrifice to God, not (as they did) of bullocks and rams, but (which was ſhadowed by thoſe legal ſacrifices) the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, <hi>Who by one offering hath perfected for ever them that are ſanctified</hi> (Heb. 10.14.)</p>
                  <p>They who deſire reconciliation with man, muſt do that which God here appointed theſe men, go to him whom they have wronged, and acknowledge their error, or that they have wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him; they muſt alſo deſire his pardon and prayers. Thus did theſe men, and they did as the Lord commanded for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, firſt, to himſelf, and then to <hi>Job.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, We may conſider this their obedience, as to the ſpring of it. What made them ſo ready, when the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them, to go and do as he had commanded them? doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs this was one thing, the men were now humbled, God had brought them to a fight of their ſin; <hi>Ye have not ſpoken of me the thing that is right;</hi> this they were made ſenſible of, and confeſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſo obeyed.</p>
                  <p>Hence, Obſerve;
<q>They who are truly humbled and touched, with a clear ſight and deep ſenſe of their ſins, will do whatſoever the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth, and as he commandeth.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>They who are made ſenſible of the wrath of God, deſerved by and kindled againſt them for their ſins, will do any thing which he commands for the obtaining of his favour. God may have
<pb n="921" facs="tcp:48669:474"/> any thing of an humble ſoul; had the Lord commanded theſe men to go to <hi>Job,</hi> and offer ſacrifice, before he had convinced them of their ſin, they might have flung away over the field, and not have kept the path of his commandments; but having humbled them they ſubmitted. When <hi>Peter</hi> had preached that notable Sermon, which prickt his hearers at the very heart (<hi>Acts</hi> 2.37.) <hi>Then they ſaid unto</hi> Peter, <hi>and to the reſt of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, men and brethren, what ſhall we do?</hi> They were not only ready to do what they were commanded, but did even ask for commands; <hi>What ſhall we do?</hi> They, as it were, threw down a blank, and deſired the Apoſtles to write what commands they would that tended to ſalvation; as if they had ſaid, we are ready to do what the Lord commandeth, and according as the Lord commandeth: Thus being made ſenſible of their ſins, and of the wrath of God, which they had provoked againſt themſelves, by crucifying the Lord of life, <hi>They cried out, what ſhall we do?</hi> We will ſubmit to any thing that is fit to be done. <hi>Saul,</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Paul,</hi> came out with fury to perſecute the Diſciples of Chriſt; but the Lord having beaten him from his horſe to the ground, <hi>he trembling and aſtoniſhed, ſaid, Lord what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> (Acts 9.6.) He was fit to take any impreſſion, and to be moulded into any form, by the hand of God. They who have been made to know what it is to break commands, are willing to obey and keep them. This was the firſt ſpring of their obedience; God had humbled them.</p>
                  <p>There was a ſecond ſpring of their obedience, which will yield a ſixth Obſervation: For, as the Lord had convinced them of their ſin, ſo he had given them hopes of mercy in the pardon of it, and of reconciliation to himſelf. So much was intimated in that gracious counſel given them; <hi>Take unto you ſeven Bullocks and ſeven Rams, and go and offer up a burnt-offering for your ſelves,</hi> &amp;c. This was a comfortable word, and doubtleſs they underſtood it ſo, and ſaid in their own hearts, God might have made us a ſacrifice, but he commands us to offer a ſacrifice. And what doth this ſignifie? Surely, that he will be gracious to us, and is ready to pardon us. Having theſe hopes of pardon, they went and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly did what the Lord commanded, they went to <hi>Job,</hi> they ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him whom they had contemned, they honoured him whom they had deſpiſed before.</p>
                  <pb n="922" facs="tcp:48669:475"/>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>The intimations of mercy, and hopes of pardon, prevail migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily upon the ſoul of a ſinner.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Lord did not only ſhew them their ſin, and terrifie them with kindled wrath, but ſhewed them a ſacrifice, and this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently won upon them. The love of God is more conſtraining than his wrath; and hopes of pardon and ſalvation, than the fear of puniſhment and damnation: both have their effects, and are ſtrong motives, wrath and love, but the ſtrongeſt is love. As when the Apoſtle beſeeched the <hi>Romans (Rom.</hi> 12.1.) to preſent themſelves a living ſacrifice, he beſought them by <hi>the mercies of God:</hi> So when the Lord commanded theſe men to offer up ſlain beaſts in ſacrifice, hope of mercy was the motive. 'Tis mercy w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> moves moſt effectually, to offer both our ſervices &amp; our ſelves a ſacrifice unto God; that's the ſame Apoſtles argument again (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1.) <hi>Wherefore having theſe promiſes, let us cleanſe our ſelves</hi> (that is, uſe all means of cleanſing our ſelves, let us go to Chriſt for the cleanſing of our ſelves) <hi>from all filthineſs both of fleſh and ſpirit, perfecting holineſs in the fear of the Lord. The end of the Commandement is charity</hi> (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.5.) that is, 'tis charity or love which gives the Commandement its end. What is the end of the Commandement? it is that we ſhould obey and fulfil it. To what end doth the Lord give us Commandements? it is that we ſhould keep them. Love is the end of the Commandement, as it gives the Commandement a compleating end. Now, whence comes our love, either to God or man? Surely from the manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of Gods love to us. So that, when the Lord manifeſteth his love to us, raiſing and confirming our hopes by promiſes, then our love appeareth in doing and keeping Commandements; and therefore, love is there joyned with faith unfeigned, a faith without hypocriſie or deceit. Now, the work of faith in God for pardon and reconciliation, is grounded upon a ſacrifice. Thus, as Evangelical obedience is better than legal, ſo mercy revealed in the Goſpel, quickens to obedience, more than wrath revealed in the Law. The ſight of mercy, and the ſenſe of the lov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> that is, he offering ſacrifice, and praying for them, they were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted. This ſheweth us the great myſtery, or the ſum of the Goſpel; the Lord did not accept them in themſelves, but he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted <hi>Job</hi> in ſacrificing for them, and all in Chriſt. And conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, it is not ſaid, The Lord accepted the ſacrifice, or the prayer of <hi>Job,</hi> but, <hi>The Lord accepted</hi> Job; his perſon was accepted in and through the ſacrifice or interceſſion of Chriſt, and his ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and interceſſion for <hi>Eliphaz</hi> and his two friends were accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed alſo in him.</p>
                  <p>How the Lord teſtified his acceptance of <hi>Job,</hi> whether by conſuming his ſacrifice with fire from heaven, or by any other outward token of his favour, is not here expreſſed, and therefore to us uncertain; only this is certain, and that is enough for us to know, that God accepted him.</p>
                  <p>What it is to <hi>accept,</hi> was ſhewed in opening the former verſe.</p>
                  <p>In brief, to be accepted, is to have favour with God, our peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions anſwered, and the things done which we move or petition for. <hi>The Lord alſo accepted</hi> Job.</p>

                     </note>And when 'tis ſaid, <hi>The Lord alſo accepted</hi> Job, this implyeth, that <hi>Job</hi> did willingly undertake the ſervice and duty for his three friends.

                  <p>For the better improvement of theſe words,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Let us compare them with thoſe in the eighth verſe. Here it is ſaid, <hi>The Lord alſo accepted</hi> Job; and there the Lord ſaid, <hi>Him will I accept;</hi> there it is a promiſe, here a perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>Whatſoever the Lord promiſeth to do, he will certainly perform and do.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>A word from God is as ſure as his deed; our hope upon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, as good as poſſeſſion; <hi>In hope of eternal life, which God who cannot lye, promiſed before the world began (Tit.</hi> 1.2.) Chriſt will be <hi>Amen,</hi> that is, performance (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20.) to all the promiſes (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20.) As they are all made in him, ſo they ſhall every one of them, and in every thing, be made good by him, <hi>unto the glory of God by us;</hi> that is, we ſhall at laſt have abundant cauſe of glorifying of God, in performing and making good of all the promiſes, upon the undertaking of Jeſus Chriſt for us. No man ſhall fail of acceptance, that is under (as <hi>Job</hi> was) a promiſe of acceptation; get under promiſes, and you ſhall partake the good promiſed.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Whereas upon their doing according as the Lord commanded, preſently it followeth, <hi>The Lord alſo accepted Job,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="925" facs="tcp:48669:476"/>
                  <p>Note;
<q>Though the Lord will ſurely perform what he hath promiſed, yet if we would have the good promiſed, we muſt do the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty commanded, otherwiſe our faith is but preſumption.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>If <hi>Eliphaz</hi> and his two friends had not done as the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them, they could not rightly have expected God ſhould do what he promiſed, <hi>accept</hi> Job, <hi>and ſo themſelves.</hi> There are promiſes of two ſorts. Firſt, of preventing grace; theſe are made to the wicked and unconverted. Secondly, there are promiſes of rewarding grace; theſe are made to the godly, who muſt perform the duty commanded, if they would receive the mercy promiſed. <hi>As many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy (Gal.</hi> 6.16.) If you will have peace, you muſt walk according to rule; the Lord is not bound to fulfil promiſes, if we take li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to break Commandements, or neglect to do them. And they who have true faith in the truth, and faithfulneſs of God to fulfil the one, can never take liberty to break the other. None are ſo ſure to the Command, as they who have fulleſt aſſurance in the Promiſe.</p>
                  <q>The Lord alſo accepted <hi>Job.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>Here are but few words, yet much matter; and who knoweth how much mercy? Here is much, yea, all in a little, <hi>The Lord accepted</hi> Job.</p>
                  <p>Hence note, Thirdly;
<q>To be accepted of God, is the anſwer of all our prayers and deſires, a full reward for all our ſervices.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Acceptation with God is the happineſs of man, and ſhould be his ſatisfaction. If we are accepted in our ſervices, we are boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully rewarded for them; and if our perſons are accepted, we ſhall be everlaſtingly ſaved. When the Lord accepted <hi>Job,</hi> he he heard his prayer for his friends, they were reconciled. This good news, <hi>The Lord alſo accepted Job,</hi> was enough to make their hearts leap for joy. <hi>Acceptation</hi> is a reviving word, the ſum of all that we can wiſh or pray for; 'tis enough &amp; enough to confirm our faith, and to wind up our aſſurance to the very higheſt expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a ſupply to all our wants, and of pardon for all our ſins. All
<pb n="926" facs="tcp:48669:477"/> the kindneſſes of God are comprehended in this one word, <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>The Lord accepted Job.</hi> Here is no mention at all of accepting his ſacrifice, yet that was accepted too.</p>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>The Lord having reſpect to our perſons, cannot but have reſpect to our ſervices.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>If our perſons are accepted, our ſervices are; and if the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of any are not reſpected, it is becauſe their perſons are not. 'Tis ſaid (<hi>Gen.</hi> 4.4, 5.) <hi>The Lord had reſpect unto</hi> Abel, <hi>and to his offering; but unto</hi> Cain <hi>and his offering, he had no reſpect.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect or no reſpect to what is done, alwayes begins with the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the doer.</p>
                  <p>Yet further, <hi>Job was accepted;</hi> but u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>on what account? or how was <hi>Job</hi> accepted? not in himſelf, nor for himſelf, but in Chriſt the promiſed <hi>Meſſias.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note, Fifthly;
<q>That any mans perſon is accepted, is from free grace, through Jeſus Chriſt.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>When we have done all, we deſerve nothing, we are only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted. The Lord accepted <hi>Job,</hi> not for his own ſake, not for the worth of his ſervice, not for the worthineſs of his perſon, but for him whom he in that action repreſented, and in whom he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Job</hi> himſelf needed Chriſt for his accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; 'tis in and through him that any are accepted. The word <hi>Acceptance</hi> plainly implieth, that there is nothing of merit in us; acceptation notes grace and favour. This reſpect to us, is not for any deſert in us.</p>
                  <p>From the whole, we may infer,
<q>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> If the Lord accepted <hi>Job</hi> when he offered ſacrifice, and prayed for his friends; how much more doth he accept Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, who offered himſelf a ſacrifice for ſinners, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver liveth to make interceſſion for them, whoſe ſacrifice he is!</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Did the Lord preſently accept <hi>Job</hi> and his friends, or <hi>Job</hi> for his friends? then what confidence may we have, that Jeſus Chriſt,
<pb n="927" facs="tcp:48669:477"/> who is our everlaſting ſacrifice and Advocate, who is entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the holieſt, the Sanctuary of heaven, and there pleads for us with his own blood, is accepted for us, and we through him. Chriſts ſuit ſhall never be refuſed, nor ſhall we, while we come to God through him. This act of divine grace, was, as I may ſay, but a ſhadow or figure of that great work of Jeſus Chriſt, in reconciling ſinners, and making them accepted with the Lord; and therefore, as often as we pray, Chriſts everlaſting ſacrifice ſhould come to our remembrance, for the confirmation of our faith, and our encouragement againſt fears. We may argue down all our doubts about acceptation by Chriſt, upon this account, that <hi>Jobs</hi> friends were accepted at his ſuit, and their accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not bottom'd on him, nor in his ſacrifice, but as both ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed Chriſt. Where the Reconciler is accepted, they that are in him, and for whom he makes requeſt, are accepted too. What the Lord ſpake from heaven (<hi>Mat.</hi> 3.17.) <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed,</hi> reacheth all believers to the end of the world, whoſe head and repreſenter Chriſt is. Let us adore, and ever be thankful, that we have received ſuch grace in Chriſt; for, though Jeſus Chriſt in his perſon is of infinite worth, and his ſacrifice of ſo great a value, that it became a price ſufficient for the ranſom and redemption of all ſinners: yet, it was of free grace that Chriſt was made a ranſom for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and we accepted through him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Take this Inference:
<q>If the Lord be ready to hear a <hi>Job</hi> for his friends, then the Lord will much more hear a <hi>Job</hi> for himſelf.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>That the prayers and ſupplications which Believers put up to the Lord, obtain mercy and good things for others, may ſtrengthen faith, that they ſhall obtain for themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, We may infer,
<q>Job was become a great favourite with God, after his humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſelf-abhorrence.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He no ſooner fell out with himſelf for his former miſcarriages, but the Lord, as it were, fell in love with him afreſh. What a favourite was he grown, who could thus readily get an anſwer, and obtain favour for thoſe, againſt whom the Lord ſaid, <hi>My wrath is kindled?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="928" facs="tcp:48669:478"/>
                  <p>Thus much concerning the judgment and determination of God in this matter, which put a period to the long continued con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie between <hi>Job</hi> and his three friends, and reconciled both parties both unto God and between themſelves. O how bleſſed is the iſſue of the Lords Judgment and undertaking towards his ſervants and children! When once he was pleaſed to appear in the caſe, he ſoon ſilenced both ſides, and made them in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion both of one heart, and of one mind.</p>
                  <p>And no ſooner was this humbling and reconciling work done and over, but reſtoring and reſtitution work followed, as will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in opening the third and laſt part of this Chapter, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the laſt part of the whole Book.</p>

                     </note> The word which we render <hi>Captivity,</hi> is by ſome rendred <hi>Repentance;</hi> and there is a twofold interpretation of that rendring.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Some refer it to God, and read the words thus, <hi>The Lord was turned to repentance concerning Job:</hi> And then the meaning is, the Lord repented or changed his diſpenſation with reſpect to the affliction of <hi>Job,</hi> when he prayed for his friends. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſpeaks of the Lords repentance two wayes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that he repenteth of the good which he hath done for, or beſtowed upon man (<hi>Gen.</hi> 6.6.) <hi>It repented the Lord that he had made man;</hi> he ſeemed as one troubled in his mind, that ever he had ſet up man in ſuch a condition. And as there the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of his making mankind in general in that good natural ſtate, ſo elſewhere he is ſaid to repent of his doing good to ſome men in particular, as to their civil ſtate (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.11.) <hi>The Lord repented that he had made Saul King,</hi> that he had ſet him upon a Throne to rule men on earth, who had no better obeyed the Rule given from his own Throne in heaven.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Lord is ſaid to repent of the evil which he hath either actually brought upon man, or threatned to bring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. In the former ſenſe <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith (<hi>Deut.</hi> 32.36.) <hi>The Lord ſhall judge his people and repent himſelf for his ſervanss, when he ſeeth that their power is gone, and there is none ſhut up or left;</hi> that is, when they are in an afflicted low condition, the Lord tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the opportunity or ſeaſon to reſtore them, and then he is ſaid to repent concerning any afflictive evil brought upon his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. In the latter ſenſe (as he is ſaid to repent of the evil threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) it is ſaid of repenting <hi>Niniveh (Jonah</hi> 3.10.) <hi>The Lord repented of the evil that he had ſaid that he would do unto them, and he did it not.</hi> Thus the Lord is turned to repentance with reſpect to evil, either brought or threatned to be brought upon a people; for which we have that remarkable promiſe (<hi>Jer.</hi> 18.7, 8.) <hi>At what inſtant I ſhall ſpeak concerning a Nation and concerning a Kingdome, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to deſtroy it; if that Nation againſt whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil I thought to do unto them.</hi> If they turn, I will turn. Another word is uſed in the Hebrew there, but it imports the ſame thing. Repentance in God is not any change of his Will, Counſel, or Purpoſe; it only notes a change in his providences and diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
<pb n="930" facs="tcp:48669:479"/> 
                     <hi>The Lord is of one mind: who can turn him?</hi> (Job 23.13.) But he is not alwayes of one way; he repenteth, that is, he chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his way ſomtimes, and ſo he did towards <hi>Job:</hi> He once caſt him down, and left him as a captive bound hand and foot under the power of Satan, as to his outward man and worldly enjoyments; but the Lord turned and repented, that is, <hi>turned his Captivity.</hi> This ſenſe and reading is much inſiſted on by ſeveral Interpreters, and it is a comfortable truth; yet I am not ſatisfied that it is the truth intended in this place.</p>

                     </gap>mer part of the Chapter. The Obſervation which naturally ariſeth from this interpretation, is clear from many other Texts of Scripture.</p>
                  <q>When perſons or Nations pray and depart from iniquity, when they joyn true repentance with prayer, the Lord turneth to them in mercy, and turneth evil away from them.</q>
                  <p>The Lord turned in mercy to repenting <hi>Job</hi> when he prayed for his friends. And this was promiſed to Gods peculiar people the Jewiſh Nation (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7.14.) <hi>If my people which are are called by my Name ſhall humble themſelves, and pray, and ſeek my face, and turn from their wicked wayes, then will I hear in heaven, and will forgive their ſin, and will heal their land.</hi> This was performed to the <hi>Ninivites,</hi> a heathen Nation; when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of the evil which they had done, God repented of the evil which he threatned to do unto them, or bring upon them, and did it not, brought it not. But I ſhall not ſtay upon this uſeful poynt here, becauſe it is grounded upon a tranſlation which is not (as I conceive) ſo clearly grounded upon the Original as our own.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, He led thoſe that were captives, ſinful men, captive; he brought them out of a miſerable captivity into a bleſſed capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, that is, from the cap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="932" facs="tcp:48669:480"/> Not only are our perſons, but our thoughts captivated to Chriſt, by the power of the Spirit miniſtred in the Goſpel. Thus the Scripture ſpeaks of <hi>captivity</hi> in both theſe notions: the <hi>captivaters</hi> and the <hi>captivated</hi> are called <hi>captivity.</hi> Here in this place, we may take it in the latter ſence, <hi>the Lord turned the captivity of</hi> Job; that is, what was captivated or taken away, the Lord, as it were, fetch't back again, and reſtored it to him. In this ſenſe <hi>Abraham,</hi> when he heard that his Nephew <hi>Lot</hi> was taken captive, <hi>led captivity captive</hi> (Gen. 14.16.) He purſued them that had taken him captive, he brought back <hi>Lot,</hi> and the reſt of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, together with the ſpoils. Thus the Lord did not only deliver <hi>Job</hi> from all thoſe evils, which he was under, but reſtored the good things to him which he had loſt or were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We may take it thus, <hi>The Lord turned the captivity of</hi> Job; that is, he took away, or called in Satans commiſſion, which he had given him over <hi>Jobs</hi> eſtate and body, and by which Satan held <hi>Job</hi> in captivity, or as his captive; for as we read (<hi>chap.</hi> 2.6.) Satan could not touch him, till he had leave, or a letter of licenſe from God; till God ſaid, <hi>Behold, all that he hath is in thy power, only upon himſelf put not forth thy hand</hi> (chap. 1.12.) Nor could he touch his perſon, till his commiſſion was enlarged; and the Lord ſaid again, <hi>Behold, he is in thine hand, but</hi> (or only) <hi>ſave his life</hi> (chap. 2.6.) And as ſoon as his commiſſion was taken away, or called in by God, he could trouble him no longer. The Lord forbidding the devil to meddle any more with him, <hi>Turned the captivity of</hi> Job.</p>
                  <p>Hence, Obſerve;
<q>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> To be in any affliction is to be in bonds or captivity.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The afflicted condition of <hi>Job</hi> was a captivity. Troubles in our eſtate, troubles in our relations, troubles in our bodies, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles in our ſouls, are like bonds and priſons. It is a very uneaſie and an uncomfortable condition to be in priſon, and ſo it is to be in any afflicted condition conſidered in it ſelf. <hi>Job</hi> ſpake as much of himſelf, while his affliction continued upon him ſtrongly (<hi>chap.</hi> 13.27.) <hi>Thou putteſt my feet in the ſtocks, and thou lookeſt narrowly unto all my paths. Job</hi> was not only as a man in captivity, but as a man in the ſtocks, which is a
<pb n="933" facs="tcp:48669:480"/> great hardſhip in captivity. <hi>David</hi> calleth ſuch an eſtate an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.33.) <hi>The Lord heareth the poor, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſeth not his priſoners.</hi> Some are priſoners ſtrictly, being under reſtraint; all are priſoners largely, or (as we ſay) priſoners at large, who are in any diſtreſs. The Lord maketh many priſoners by ſickneſs and weakneſs of body, as alſo by poverty and the want of bodily comforts and conveniences. The afflicted condition of the Church in any kind is expreſſed by captivity, as captivity, in kind, is ſometimes the affliction of the Church. The ten tribes were led into captivity by <hi>Salmanazar, Judah</hi> by <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnazzar.</hi> Hence that promiſe (<hi>Jerem.</hi> 30.18.) <hi>Behold, I will bring again the captivity of</hi> Jacobs <hi>tents;</hi> And that prayer (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 14.7.) <hi>O that the ſalvation of</hi> Iſrael <hi>were come out of</hi> Sion. <hi>When the Lord bringeth back the captivity of his people,</hi> Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob <hi>ſhall rejoyce, and</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſhall be glad.</hi> This Scripture may be taken both ſtrictly, as a prayer for their return out of proper capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, and largely, for their deliverance out of any adverſity: So (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 126.1.) <hi>When the Lord turned the captivity of</hi> Sion <hi>we were like them that dream.</hi> Read alſo (<hi>Zeph.</hi> 2.7.)</p>
                  <p>Secondly, From the author of this turn, <hi>The Lord turned the captivity,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve.</p>
                  <q>Deliverance out of an afflicted ſtate is of the Lord.</q>
                  <p>He is the authour of theſe comfortable turns, and he is to be acknowledged as the authour of them. The <hi>Pſalmist</hi> prayed thrice, <hi>Turn us again</hi> (Pſal. 80.3, 7, 19.) The waters of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction would continually riſe and ſwell higher and higher, did not the Lord ſtop and turn them, did not he command them back, and cauſe an ebb. Satan would never have done bringing the floods of affliction upon <hi>Job,</hi> if the Lord had not forbidden him and turned them. It was the Lord who took all from <hi>Job,</hi> as he acknowledged (<hi>chap.</hi> 1.21.) and it was the Lord who reſtored all to him again; as we ſee here the ſame hand did both in his caſe, and doth both in all ſuch caſes (<hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.1.) <hi>Let us return to the Lord for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath ſmitten, and he will bind us up. David</hi> aſcribed both to God (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.11, 12.) <hi>Thou broughteſt us into the net; thou layedſt affliction upon our loins: thou haſt cauſed men to ride over our heads, we went
<pb n="934" facs="tcp:48669:481"/> through fire and through water.</hi> The hand of God led them in that fire and water of affliction, through which they went; but who led them out? The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> tells us, in the next words, <hi>Thou broughteſt us into a wealthy place;</hi> the Margin ſaith, <hi>into a moiſt place.</hi> They were in fire and water before. <hi>Fire</hi> is the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of heat and drineſs; water is the extremity of moiſtne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>gantly ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows that comfortable and contentful condition, into which the good hand of God had brought them, which is ſignificantly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in our tranſlation, <hi>by a wealthy place;</hi> thoſe places flouriſhing moſt in fruitfulneſs, and ſo in wealth, which are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther over-hot nor over-cold, neither ove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>-dry nor over-moiſt. And as in that Pſalm <hi>David</hi> acknowledged the hand of God in this, ſo in another, he celebrated the Lords power and goodneſs for this (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.20.) <hi>He that is our God is the God of ſalvation, and unto God the Lord belong the iſſues from death;</hi> that is, the out-lets or out-gates from death, are from the Lord; he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth from the grave, and from every grief. <hi>The Lord turned the captivity of</hi> Job, not only p eſerving him from death, but filling him with the good things and comforts of this life.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Note;
<q>The Lord can ſuddenly make a change or turn.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>As he can quickly make a great change from proſperity to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, and in a moment b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ing darkneſs upon thoſe who injoy the ſweeteſt light; ſo he can quickly make a change from adverſity to proſperity, from captivity to liberty, and turn the darkeſt night into a morning light. For ſuch a turn the Church prayed (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 126.4.) <hi>Turn again our captivity, O Lord, as the ſtreams in the ſouth,</hi> that is, do it ſpeedily. The ſouth is a dry place, thither ſtreams come, not by a ſlow, conſtant currant, but as mighty ſtreams, or land-floods, by a ſudden unexpected rain; like that (1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.41, 45.) <hi>Get thee up</hi> (ſaid <hi>Eliah</hi> to <hi>Ahab) for there is a ſound of aboundance of rain, and preſently the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain.</hi> When great rains come, after long drought, they make ſudden floods and ſtreams. Such a ſudden income of mercy, or deliverance
<pb n="935" facs="tcp:48669:481"/> from captivity, the Church then prayed for, and was in the faith and hope of; nor was that hope in vain; nor ſhall any, who in that condition wait patiently upon God, be aſhamed of their hope. The holy Evangeliſt makes report (<hi>Luke</hi> 13.16.) that Satan had bound a poor woman <hi>eighteen years,</hi> all that time he had her his priſoner; but Jeſus Chriſt in a moment made her free. <hi>Ought not this woman, being a daughter of</hi> Abraham, <hi>whom Satan hath bound, lo, theſe eighteen years, be looſed from this bond on the ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day?</hi> The devil, who had her in his power eighteen years, could not hold her a moment, when Jeſus Chriſt would turn her captivity, and looſe her from that bond. If the Son undertake to make any free, whether from corporal or ſpiritual bondage, they ſhall not only <hi>be free indeed</hi> (as he ſpake, <hi>John</hi> 8.36.) at the time when he is pleaſed to do it, but he can do it at any time, in the ſhorteſt time, when he pleaſeth. We find a like turn of capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity is deſcribed (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 107.10, 11, 12, 13, 14.) ſuch as ſit in darkneſs, <hi>and in the ſhadow of death, being bound in affliction and iron, becauſe they rebelled againſt the word of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe (<hi>verſ.</hi> 13.) <hi>cryed unto the Lord in their trouble, and he ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them out of their diſtreſſes: He brought them out of darkneſs, and the ſhadow of death, and brake their bands in ſunder.</hi> Thus far of the firſt particular conſiderable in <hi>Jobs</hi> reſtitution, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it, <hi>The Lord turned the captivity of</hi> Job.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing to be conſidered, is the ſeaſon which the Lord took for the turning of <hi>Jobs</hi> captivity; the Lord did it ſaith the text,
<q>When he prayed for his friends.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some conceive the turn of his captivity was juſt in his prayer time, and that even then his body was healed. I ſhall have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſpeak further to that afterwards upon another verſe. Thus much is clear, that
<q>When he prayed,</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>That is, either in the very praying time, or preſently upon it, the Lord <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>urned his captivity. Poſſibly the Lord did not ſtay till he had done, accor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ing to that (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.24.) <hi>It ſhall come to paſs, that before they call, I will anſwer; and while they are yet ſpeaking, I will hear.</hi> Or according to that (<hi>Dan.</hi> 9.20.)
<pb n="936" facs="tcp:48669:482"/> 
                     <hi>While I was ſpeaking, and praying, and confeſſing my ſin, and the ſin of my people</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and preſenting my ſupplications before the Lord my God, for the holy mountain of my God: Yea, while I was ſpeaking in prayer, even the man</hi> Gabriel, <hi>whom I had ſeen in the viſion at the beginning, being cauſed to flie ſwiftly, touched me, about the time of the evening oblation, and he informed me, and talked with me, and ſaid, O</hi> Daniel, <hi>I am come forth to give thee skill and underſtanding; at the beginning of thy ſupplications the commandement came forth, and I am come to ſhew thee,</hi> &amp;c. What commandement came forth? even a command for the turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their captivity. Thus here (I ſay) poſſibly the Lord gave out that word of command, for the turning of <hi>Jobs</hi> captivity, at that very time when he was praying for his friends.</p>
                  <p>But without queſtion, theſe words, <hi>when he prayed for his friends,</hi> note a very ſpeedy return of his prayers; that is, ſoon after he had done that gracious office for them, he found matters mending with himſelf, and the anſwers of prayer in the mercies of God coming tumbling in thick and three-fold. His captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty fled far away when he had thus drawn near to God; he had, as a very full and ſatisfactory, ſo a very ſpeedy anſwer,
<q>When he prayed.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Prayer is the making known our wants and deſires to God. It is a ſpiritual work, not a meer bodily exerciſe; it is the labour of the heart, not lip-labour. <hi>Jobs</hi> prayer was a fervent working, or effectual prayer (as the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>chap.</hi> 5.16.) not a cold, ſlothful, ſleepy prayer; when he prayed, he made work of prayer. Many ſpeak words of prayer, that make no work of prayer, nor are they at work in prayer. <hi>Job</hi> prayed in the ſame ſenſe that <hi>Saul</hi> (afterwards <hi>Paul</hi>) did (<hi>Acts.</hi> 9.11.) when the Lord Jeſus bid <hi>Ananias</hi> go to him, for, <hi>Behold he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,</hi> implying, that he was at it indeed. He had been brought up after the ſtricteſt rule of the Phariſees, who prayed much, or made many prayers; but he prayed to ſo little purpoſe before, that we may well call that his firſt prayer, and ſay he had never pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before. <hi>Job</hi> prayed for his friends, as <hi>Paul</hi> for himſelf; he was very earneſt with God for them, and prevailed. Extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry caſes call for extraordinary layings out in duty. It was an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary caſe, <hi>When he prayed</hi>

                  <p>The Hebrew is, <hi>When he prayed for his friend.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Singulare par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titivum pro plurali. <hi>Merc.</hi>
                     </note> It is uſual in the Grammar of the holy Text, to put the ſingular for the plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral: 'Tis ſo here, either, Firſt, becauſe he prayed for every one of them diſtinctly, and by name; or, Secondly, becauſe he look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon them all as one, and bound them up in the ſame requeſts, <hi>When he prayed</hi>
                     <q>For his friends.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>They are called his friends, to ſhew the eſteem that he had of them, notwithſtanding all their unkindneſs and unfriendlineſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him. He prayed for them in much love,<note place="margin">O, raram &amp; ſingularem vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutem, quae in pauciſſimis vel Chriſtianis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periatur. <hi>Merc.</hi>
                     </note> though they had ſhewed little love to him; and his heart was ſo much towards them, that the Text ſpeaks as if he had forgot himſelf, or left him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at that time quite out of his prayers. Doubtleſs <hi>Job</hi> prayed for himſelf, but his great buſineſs at that time with God, was, <hi>for his friends.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, in that <hi>Jobs</hi> prayer is ſaid expreſly to be for his friends, not for himſelf, though we cannot doubt but that he prayed, and prayed much for himſelf;</p>
                  <p>Obſerve;
<q>A godly man is free to pray for others, as well as for himſelf, and in ſome caſes, or at ſome times, more for others than for himſelf.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He ſeldom drives this bleſſed trade with heaven for ſelf only, and he ſometimes doth it upon the alone account of others. 'Tis a great piece of ſpiritualneſs, to walk exactly, and keep in with God to the utmoſt, that ſo our own perſonal ſoul concerns may not take up our whole time in prayer, but that we may have a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of ſpirit to inlarge for the benefit of others. Many by their uneven walkings, exceedingly hinder themſelves in this duty of praying for friends, and of praying for the whole Church. Uneven walkings hinder that duty in a twofold reſpect.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe they indiſpoſe the heart to prayer in general; which is one ſpecial reaſon why the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> gives that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel to Husband and Wife (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.7.) <hi>to walk according to knowledge, and as being heirs together of the ſame grace of life,
<pb n="938" facs="tcp:48669:483"/> that</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>your prayers be not hindred;</hi> that is, leſt your hearts be indiſpoſed to prayer.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Becauſe uneven walkings will find us ſo much work for our ſelves in prayer, that we ſhall ſcarce have time or leiſure to intend or ſue out the benefit of others in prayer. He that watcheth over his own heart and wayes, will be and do moſt in prayer for others. And that,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, For the removing or preventing of the ſorrows and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of others.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, For the removing of the ſins of others; yea, though their ſins have been againſt himſelf, which was <hi>Jobs</hi> caſe. He pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for thoſe who had dealt very hardly with him, and ſinned againſt God in doing ſo; he prayed for the pardon of their ſin, God being very angry with them, and having told them he would deal with them according to their folly, unleſs they made <hi>Job</hi> their friend to him. This was the occaſion of <hi>Jobs</hi> travelling in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for his friends; and in this he ſhewed a ſpirit becoming the Goſpel, though he lived not in the clear light of it. And how uncomely is it, that any ſhould live leſs in the power of the Goſpel, while they live more in the light of it? To pray much for others, eſpecially for thoſe who have wronged and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved us, hath much of the power of the Goſpel, and of the Spirit of Chriſt in it. For, thus Jeſus Chriſt, while he was nailed to the Croſs, prayed for the pardon of their ſins and out-rages, who had crucified him, <hi>Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do (Luke</hi> 23.34.) Even while his crucifiers were reviling him, he was begging for them, and beſeeching his Father that he would ſhew them mercy, who had ſhewed him no mercy, no, nor done him common juſtice. And thus (in his meaſure) <hi>Jobs</hi> heart was carryed out in his prayer for his friends, that thoſe ſins of theirs might be forgiven them, by which they had much wronged him, yea, and derided him (in a ſort) upon his Croſs, as the <hi>Jews</hi> did Chriſt upon his. This alſo was the frame of <hi>Davids</hi> heart, towards thoſe that had injured him (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 109.4.) <hi>For my love they are my adverſaries</hi> (that's an ill requital; but how did he requite them? we may take his own word for it, he tells us how) <hi>but I give my ſelf unto prayer;</hi> yea, he ſeemed a man wholly given unto prayer. The elegant conciſeneſs of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew is, <hi>But I prayer;</hi> we ſupply it thus, <hi>But I give my ſelf unto
<pb n="939" facs="tcp:48669:483"/> prayer:</hi> They are ſinning againſt me, requiting my love with ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, <hi>But I give my ſelf unto prayer.</hi> But for whom did he pray? doubtleſs he prayed, and prayed much for himſelf; he prayed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo for them. We may underſtand thoſe words, <hi>I give my ſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to prayer,</hi> two wayes. Firſt, I pray againſt their plots and evil dealings with me (prayer was <hi>Davids</hi> beſt ſtrength alwayes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his enemies) yet that was not all. But, Secondly, <hi>I give my ſelf to prayer,</hi> that the Lord would pardon their ſin, and turn their hearts, when they are doing me miſchief; or, though they have done me miſchief, I am wiſhing them the beſt good. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> (in another place) ſhewed what a ſpirit of charity he was cloathed with, when no reproof could hinder him from praying for others (in ſome good men, reproofs ſtir up paſſion, not pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er) (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 141.5.) <hi>Let the righteous ſmite me, it ſhall be a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> (ſmite me, how? with reproof; ſo it followeth) <hi>Let him reprove me, it ſhall be an excellent oyl, which ſhall not break my head, for yet my prayer ſhall be in their calamities;</hi> that is, if ever they who are my reprovers fall into calamity, though they may think they have provoked me ſo by reproving me, that they have loſt my love, and have caſt them out of my prayers, or that I will never ſpeak well of them, or for them again, yet I will pray for them with all my heart, as their matters ſhall require; I will pray for them when they have moſt need of prayer, even in their calamity. Some heighten the ſenſe thus; The more they ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen their reproof, the more I think my ſelf bound to pray for them. It ſhews an excellent ſpirit, not to be hindred from doing good to others, by any thing they do or ſpeak againſt us, nor by their ſharpeſt (though perhaps miſtaken) reproofs of us. Thus it was with this good man, <hi>Job prayed for his friends,</hi> who had ſpoken much againſt him, and not only reproved him without cauſe, but reproached him without charity; and God turned his captivity when he <hi>prayed for them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence obſerve, Secondly;
<q>Prayer for friends, eſpecially for unkind friends, is very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to God, and profitable to us.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>We never reap more fruit or benefit by prayer our ſelves, than when we lay out our ſelves in prayer for others; and then moſt, when we pray for thoſe who have deſerved leaſt at our hands.
<pb n="940" facs="tcp:48669:484"/> Prayer for unkind friends, is the greateſt kindneſs we can do them, and the nobleſt way of recompencing their unkindneſs. Holy <hi>David</hi> was much in this way of duty, and found the benefit of it (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 35.12, 13.) <hi>They rewarded me evil for good, to the ſpoyling of my ſoul; but as for me, when they were ſick, my cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was ſackcloth, I humbled my ſoul with faſting</hi> (that is, I was greatly affected with, and afflicted for them in their affliction; and ſee what followed) <hi>My prayer returned into my own boſom.</hi> There is ſome difference about the Expoſition of thoſe words; but I conceive that is clear in it ſelf, as well as to my purpoſe, that <hi>David</hi> received fruit and a good reward for thoſe prayers. As if he had ſaid, <hi>If my prayer did them no good, it did me good; if it did not profit them, it profited me; my prayer returned into my own boſom, I found comfortable effects of it.</hi> We never gain more by prayer, than when we pray for thoſe by whom we have been lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers; we never find more comfort by prayer, than when we pray heartily for thoſe by whom we have found much ſorrow: what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever good we pray for in the behalf of others, falls upon our own heads; and the more we pray for good upon the heads of thoſe that have done evil to us, the more good is like to fall upon our own heads and hearts. Chriſt ſaith (<hi>Mat.</hi> 10.13.) <hi>When ye come into an houſe, ſalute it</hi> (Chriſt means not a Courtly complemental ſalute, but a Chriſtian ſpiritual ſalute, wiſhing them mercy and peace, as is plain by that which followeth) <hi>and if the houſe be worthy, let your peace come upon it; but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you.</hi> As if he had ſaid, <hi>When ye come into an houſe, good or bad, ſalute it; if the houſe be good, they ſhall receive the benefit of your prayer, if not, you ſhall have the benefit of it your ſelves;</hi> though they get no good by your good wiſhes to them, or prayers for them, yet you ſhall. This is more expreſly aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red us again by our bleſſed Saviour (<hi>Luke</hi> 10.6.) <hi>Into whatſoever houſe ye enter, firſt ſay, peace be to this houſe</hi> (beſtow a prayer up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them) <hi>and if the Son of peace be there, your peace ſhall reſt upon it; if not, it ſhall turn to you again;</hi> your prayers ſhall not be loſt, nor ſhall ye be loſers by your prayers.</p>
                  <pb n="941" facs="tcp:48669:484"/>
                  <p>Hence take theſe two Inferences.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> If when we pray for friends, for unkind friends, God be ready to do us good, then he will be much more ready to do us good, when we (as he hath commanded us) pray for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed or real enemies.</q>
                  <p>The worſe they are (if not ſo bad as to be paſt prayer, by the Apoſtles rule, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.16.) for whom we pray, the better are our prayers, and an argument, as of our greater faith in God, ſo of our greater love to man.</p>
                  <p>Yet this is not to be underſtood, as if we ſhould pray for the proſperity of enemies, or evil men, in their evil purpoſes or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices (this were to pray at once for the miſery of <hi>Sion,</hi> for the downfal of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the diſhonour of God.) Our prayer for enemies, ſhould only be, that God would change their hearts, and pardon their ſins, as was touched before. I grant, we may (in ſome caſes) pray, <hi>Lord, overturn, overturn them;</hi> or (as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> againſt <hi>Achitophel) Lord, turn their counſels into fooliſhneſs;</hi> yet even then we ſhould alſo pray (with reſpect to their perſons) <hi>Lord turn them, turn them.</hi> The Goſpel teacheth us to do ſo (<hi>Luke</hi> 6.28.) <hi>Bleſs them that curſe you, pray for them that deſpitefully uſe you:</hi> Not that we ſhould pray for a bleſſing on them as they are curſers and deſpiſers, but that they may repent, and give over their curſed curſings and deſpiteful uſages. The Apoſtle is full for this (<hi>Rom.</hi> 12.14.) <hi>Bleſs them that perſecute you, bleſs and curſe not</hi> (verſ. 19.) <hi>Avenge not your ſelves.</hi> And as we ſhould not avenge our ſelves, ſo we ſhould be ſparing in prayer, that God would take vengeance; and if ever we put up ſuch prayers, beware they flow not from a ſpirit of revenge. We, indeed, are ſometimes afraid to be over-gentle and kind-hearted towards them that offend us; and this bad Proverb is too much remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, <hi>If we play the Sheep, the Wolf will eat us up,</hi> as if to do our duty, were to run further into danger, and that it muſt needs turn to our wrong, not to avenge our wrongs. But know, if we carry it meekly like ſheep, we have a great Shepheard, who will take care of us, and is able to preſerve us from the Wolf. Conſider theſe two things in praying for enemies, or for thoſe that have any way wronged us.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, If by prayer we gain them ('tis poſſible by prayer to turn a Wolf into a Sheep) then it will be well with us, they will be our friends.</p>
                  <pb n="942" facs="tcp:48669:485"/>
                  <p>Secondly, If they continue Wolves and enemies ſtill, God will be more our friend, and turn the evil which they either in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend or do us, to our good.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond Inference is this.</p>
                  <q>If God be ready to deliver us from evil, and do us good when we pray for others, then he will be ready to do us good, and deliver us from evil, when we pray for our ſelves.</q>
                  <p>This Inference appears every where in Scripture. And as the Lord himſelf hath often invited or encouraged us to the duty of prayer for our ſelves by this promiſe; take one inſtance for all (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.15.) <hi>Call upon me in the day of trouble, I will deliver thee, and thou ſhalt glorifie me;</hi> that is, thou ſhalt have both oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion and a heart to glorifie me. So the Lords ſervants have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten had experience of his power and goodneſs in delivering them; or, as 'tis here expreſſed concerning <hi>Job,</hi> of turning their capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity; take one inſtance for all (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.4, 6.) <hi>I</hi> (ſaid <hi>David) ſought the Lord, and he heard me, and delivered me from all my fears. This poor man cryed, and the Lord heard him, and ſaved him out of all his troubles.</hi> The Lord, who doth us good when we pray for others, cannot but do it when we pray for our ſelves. <hi>The Lord turned the captivity of</hi> Job, <hi>when he prayed for his friends.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But ſome may ask, will the Lord turn any mans captivity, when he prayeth for his friends? whoſe prayer, and what prayer is it that obtains ſo high a favour?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, in general; It is the prayer of a <hi>Job.</hi> That is,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The prayer of a faithful man, or of one who is perfect and upright with God. It is not the prayer of every man that prevails with God (<hi>Jam.</hi> 5.16.) <hi>The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man</hi> (only) <hi>availeth much.</hi> Nor is it the prayer of a meer morally righteous man, that availeth; he muſt be an Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelically righteous man, that is, a man eſtated by faith in the righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As 'tis the prayer of the faithful, ſo the prayer of faith; as it is the prayer of one in a ſtate of grace, ſo of one act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his graces, eſpecially that grace of faith. It is poſſible for a man that hath faith, not to pray in faith; and ſuch a prayer ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth not (<hi>Jam.</hi> 1.5, 6, 7.) <hi>If any man</hi> (ſaith that Apoſtle) <hi>lack wiſdom;</hi> we may ſay, whatſoever any man lacketh, <hi>let him
<pb n="943" facs="tcp:48669:485"/> ask of God; but let him ask in faith, nothing wavering: for let not that man</hi> (the man that wavereth) <hi>think that he ſhall receive any thing</hi> (that is, any good thing asked) <hi>of the Lord.</hi> To ask without faith, may bear the name, but is not the thing called prayer; and therefore ſuch receive nothing when they ask.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It is the prayer of a perſon repenting, as well as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving. <hi>Job</hi> was a penitent, he repented in duſt and aſhes for the evil he had done, before he obtained that good for his friends and for himſelf by prayer. <hi>If my people</hi> (ſaith the Lord, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7.14.) <hi>Which are called by my name, ſhall humble themſelves, and pray, and ſeek my face, and turn from their wicked wayes</hi> (there's compleat repentance) <hi>then will I hear from heaven, and forgive their ſin, and heal their Land</hi> (there is compleat mercy.) Some pretend, at leaſt, to be much in believing, yet are little, if at all, in repenting and humbling themſelves under the mighty hand of God. How can their prayers prevail, for the turning away of their captivity, who turn not from iniquity? <hi>If I</hi> (ſaid <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 66.18.) <hi>regard iniquity in my heart</hi> (his meaning is, if I put it not both out of my heart and hand, by ſound repentance) <hi>God will not hear me;</hi> that is, he will not regard, much leſs fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably anſwer, my prayer. It is a piece of impude<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, I am ſure, ſuch a piece of confidence, as God will reject, and wherein no man ſhall proſper, to expect good from God by prayers, while our evils are retained, or abide in our boſoms unrepented of. God hath joyned faith and repentance together; woe to thoſe who put them aſunder. They who either repent without believing, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve without repenting, indeed do neither; they neither repent, nor believe, nor can they obtain any thing of God by prayer. But, the prayer of a faithful man, made in faith, and mixed with ſound repentance, will make great turns; ſuch a one may turn the whole world about by the engine of prayer.</p>
                  <p>But, what is there in ſuch a prayer, that ſhould make ſuch turns, and move the Lord to change his diſpenſations, or our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions? I anſwer,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Such prayer is the Lords own Ordinance or appointment; and he will anſwer that. When we meet God in his own way, he cannot refuſe us; he ſeals to his own inſtitutions, by gracious anſwers.</p>
                  <pb n="944" facs="tcp:48669:486"/>
                  <p>Secondly, As prayer is the Ordinance of God, ſo he hath made promiſe to hear and turn the captivity of thoſe that pray, as was ſhewed before. Promiſes are engagements to performance. God will not be behind hand with man, as to any engagement: For, as he is powerful, and can, ſo he is faithful, and will do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he hath engaged himſelf to do by promiſe. A word from the God of heaven, is enough to ſettle our ſouls upon for ever, ſeeing his <hi>word is ſettled for ever in heaven (Pſal.</hi> 119.89.) Half a promiſe, or an half promiſe, an <hi>it may be (Zeph.</hi> 2.3.) from God, is better ſecurity than an abſolute promiſe, than an <hi>it ſhall be,</hi> yea, than an oath from any of the ſons of men.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Prayer honours God. Our ſeeking to him in our wants and weakneſſes, in our fears and dangers, are an argument that we ſuppoſe him able to help us, &amp; that all our ruines may be under his hand: Such a ſeeking to God, is the honouring of God; and therefore, God is a rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him, and call upon him. Our coming to God in all our wants, ſhews, that he is an inexhauſtible fountain; ſo <hi>thick a cloud,</hi> thar we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not weary him, nor he ſpend all his waters, how much ſoever he ſhowers down, or ſpends upon us. He can diſtil mercies, and drop down bleſſings everlaſtingly. We often want veſſels to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, but he never wants oyle to give. It is the glory of Kings and Princes, that ſo many come with petitions to them; that they have many ſuiters at their gates, may poſſibly burden them, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly it honours them; doth it not ſignifie, that he hath a purſe to relieve their neceſſities? or power to redreſs their wrongs and injuries? <hi>O thou that heareſt prayer,</hi> is a title of honour given to God (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 65.2.) <hi>To thee ſhall all fleſh come.</hi> As God hath ſaid (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.15.) they that call upon him ſhall glorified him, for help received, ſo they do glorifie him, by calling upon him for help: No marvel then, if he turn a <hi>Jobs</hi> captivity, when he prayeth.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Prayer is the voice of the new creature. The Lord loveth that voice, 'tis muſick, the beſt muſick, next to praiſe, in his ear. <hi>Let me hear thy voice (Cant.</hi> 2.14.) that is, let me hear thee praying, or thy prayer-voice; <hi>let me ſee thy countenance: for ſweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely.</hi> The Lord delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in prayer; therefore the Lord will turn the captivity of a <hi>Job</hi> when he prayeth.</p>
                  <pb n="945" facs="tcp:48669:486"/>
                  <p>Fifthly, Prayer is not only the voice of the new creature, but it is the voice of the Spirit with the new creature. <hi>The Spirit himſelf maketh interceſſion for us</hi> (Rom. 8.26.) 'Tis the holy Spirits work to form requeſts in our hearts to God. As <hi>the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit it ſelf witneſſeth with our ſpirits, that we are the children of God</hi> (Rom. 8.16.) ſo he prayeth in the ſpirits of Gods children. The prayer of a believer hath the power of the holy Spirit in it, and therefore it muſt needs make great turns. God turned the captivity of <hi>Job</hi> when he prayed.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Jeſus Chriſt preſents ſuch prayers, the prayers of faith, the prayers of repentance, unto God his Father. Chriſts interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion gives effect, or gets anſwer to our ſupplications. The Father hears the Son always (<hi>John</hi> 11.42.) and ſo he doth all them, whoſe prayers are offered to him by the Son (<hi>Revel.</hi> 8.3.) <hi>The angel came and ſtood at the altar, having a golden cenſer, and there was given unto him much incenſe, that he ſhould offer it with the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of all Saints, upon the golden altar which was before the throne.</hi> The angel there ſpoken of, is the <hi>angel or meſſenger of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> propheſied of (<hi>Mal.</hi> 3.1.) that is, Jeſus Chriſt, 'tis he, he alone, who offers the incenſe of his own prayers, with the prayers of all Saints, upon the golden altar, which is before the throne; and being there repreſented doing ſo, preſently (as it followeth, <hi>ver.</hi> 5.) <hi>There were voices, and thunders, and lighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> ſignifying the wonderful effects of prayer, till it ſhould come (after many turnings in the world, or, as I may ſay, after a world of turnings) to the Lords turning of <hi>Sions</hi> captivity, as here of <hi>Jobs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Seventhly, Jeſus Chriſt doth not only preſent the prayers of believers to God, but alſo prayeth in them; when ſaints pray he prayeth in them, for he and they are myſtically one: And as Chriſt <hi>is in believers the hope of glory</hi> (Col. 1.27.) ſo he is in them the help of duty; and ſo much their help, that <hi>without him they can do nothing</hi> (John 15.5.) Now a believers prayer being, in this ſenſe, Chriſts prayer, it cannot but do great things.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, As Jeſus Chriſt preſents the prayers of believers to the Father, and prayeth in them, or helps them to pray, by the bleſſed and holy Spirit ſent down, according to his gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, into their hearts; ſo he himſelf prayeth for them, when they are not actually praying for themſelves. For (ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
<pb n="946" facs="tcp:48669:487"/> 
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25.) <hi>He ever liveth to make interceſſion for them.</hi> The beſt believers do not always make ſupplications for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; but Chriſt is always making, as well as he ever lives to make, interceſſion for them. The Apoſtle (ſpeaking of Chriſts interceſſion) uſeth the word in the preſent tenſe or time, which denoteth a continued act (<hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34.) <hi>Who is even at the right hand of God, who alſo maketh interceſſion for us.</hi> The ſacrifice of Chriſt (though but once offered) is an everlaſting ſacrifice; and this other part of his prieſtly-office, his interceſſion, is ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, as being often, yea, always or everlaſtingly offered. The way or manner of Chriſts making everlaſting interceſſion for us, is a great ſecret; it may ſuffice us to know and believe that he doth it. Now it is chiefly from this everlaſting interceſſion of Chriſt, that both the perſons of the elect partake of the benefits of his ſacrifice, and that their prayers are anſwered for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of any good, as alſo for the removal of any evil, as here <hi>Jobs</hi> was for the turning of his captivity.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have given a brief accompt of this inference, that if prayer prevails to turn the captivity of others, then much more our own. Prayer hath had a great hand in all the good turns that ever the Lord made for his Church: And when the Lord ſhall fully turn the captivity of <hi>Sion,</hi> his Church, he will pour out a mighty ſpirit of prayer upon all the ſons of <hi>Sion.</hi> The Prophet fore-ſhewed the return of the captivity of the <hi>Jews</hi> out of <hi>Babi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> (Jerem. 29.10.) <hi>After ſeventy years be accompliſhed at</hi> Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilon, <hi>I will viſit you, and perform my good word towards you, in cauſing you to return to this place; for I know the thoughts that I think towards you, ſaith the Lord, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end.</hi> But what ſhould the frame of their hearts be at that day? the 12th verſe tells us, <hi>And ye ſhall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken.</hi> Theſe words may bear a two-fold ſenſe. Firſt, The ſenſe of a command; <hi>Then ſhall ye call upon me, and then ſhall ye go and pray,</hi> That is your duty in that day. Secondly, I conceive they may alſo bear the ſenſe of a promiſe; then ſhall your hearts be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, then I will pour out a ſpirit of prayer upon you, <hi>And ye ſhall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken.</hi> We may conclude the approach of mercy, when we diſcern the ſpirits of men up in and warm at this duty. Many enquire about the time, when the
<pb n="947" facs="tcp:48669:487"/> captivity of <hi>Sion</hi> ſhall fully end? we may find an anſwer to that queſtion beſt, by the inlargement of our own hearts in prayer. <hi>David</hi> ſpeaking of that, ſaid (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.17.) <hi>He will regard the prayer of the deſtitute</hi> (the meaneſt and loweſt ſhrubs in grace, as the word there uſed imports) <hi>and not deſpiſe</hi> (that is, he will highly eſteem, and therefore anſwer) <hi>their prayer:</hi> How much more the prayer of the tall cedars in grace, or of the ſtrong wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, when they call upon him, and cry unto him, with all their might day and night? <hi>The Lord turned the captivity of</hi> Job <hi>when he prayed for his friends.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nor was it a bare turn. As <hi>Job</hi> did not offer a lean ſacrifice to God in prayer, but the ſtrength of his ſoul went out in it; ſo the Lord, in giving him an anſwer, did not give him a lean or ſlight return, but, as it followeth,
<q>Alſo the Lord gave <hi>Job</hi> twice as much as he had before.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Hebrew is, <hi>The Lord added to</hi> Job <hi>to the double.</hi> Some tranſlate too barely, <hi>The Lord made an acceſſion</hi> or <hi>an addition;</hi> but that doth not reach the ſenſe intended: For, a little more than he had before, had been an addition to what he had before; but double is more than a little, or the common notion of an additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the Lord gave him twice as much, or double, to that great eſtate which he had before. This doubling of his eſtate may be taken two ways.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Strictly, as four is twice two, and eight twice four.<note place="margin">See the wild conceits of the <hi>Jewiſh Rabbins</hi> about the doubling of <hi>Jobs</hi> eſtate, in <hi>Mercer</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the place.</note> In that ſtrict ſence it may be taken here, as to his perſonal eſtate; but as to perſons it will not hold, the number of his children was the ſame as before. If we compare this chapter with the firſt chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (<hi>ver.</hi> 3.) we find his eſtate doubled in ſtrict ſence: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>Job</hi> had then ſeven thouſand ſheep, now ſaith this chapter (<hi>ver.</hi> 12.) <hi>he had fourteen thouſand ſheep;</hi> and whereas before he had three thouſand camels, now he had <hi>ſix thouſand camels;</hi> and whereas before he had five hundred yoke of oxen, now he had <hi>a thouſand yoke of oxen;</hi> and laſtly, whereas before he had five hundred ſhe aſſes, now he had <hi>a thouſand ſhe aſſes.</hi> Here was double in the letter;<note place="margin">In duplum, i. e. in plurimum. Quam pluri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum? numerus finitus pro infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nito. <hi>Jun.</hi>
                     </note> the Lord added all his cattle double in number: Yet we need not tye up the word <hi>double,</hi> or <hi>twice as much,</hi> ſtrictly to that ſenſe. Therefore</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Double may be taken largely, and ſo <hi>double or twice as much,</hi> is very much. He added to him double, that is, he
<pb n="948" facs="tcp:48669:488"/> made a very great addition, poſſibly in ſome things treble, yea, fourfold to what he had before. And thus the Lord made good what <hi>Bildad</hi> had ſpoken to <hi>Job,</hi> cloſely hinting, that ſurely <hi>Job</hi> lay in ſome ſecret ſin, and was not right with God, becauſe God let him lye in that forlorn condition, and did not ſo much as reſtore him to the ſame, much leſs raiſe him to a better eſtate, than he had before (<hi>chap.</hi> 8.6, 7.) <hi>If thou wert pure, and upright, ſurely, now he would awake for thee, and make the habitation of thy righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs proſperous: Though thy beginning was ſmall, yet thy latter end ſhould greatly increaſe.</hi> It is uſual in the Hebrew, to ſay thoſe things are double, which excel and are great. Thus ſpake <hi>Zophar</hi> (chap. 11.6.) <hi>O that God would ſpeak and open his lips against thee; and that he would ſhew thee the ſecrets of wiſdom, that they are double to that which is. Know therefore,</hi> &amp;c. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of Divine wiſdom are double to what is, namely, to what they appear, or are apprehended to be: The wiſdom of God is double, yea, an hundred fold more than what man is able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it to be; The ſecrets of Gods wiſdom are unſearchable, and paſt any creatures finding out. Thus in other Scriptures <hi>double</hi> is put for very much (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.2.) <hi>Speak ye comfortably to</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and cry unto her, that her warfare is accompliſhed, that her iniquity is pardoned, for ſhe hath received of the Lords hand double for all her ſins.</hi> We muſt not think that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> made ſatisfaction to the Lord for her ſin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, much leſs may we imagine that <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> ſufferings did exceed her ſins, or the deſert of her ſins: For 'tis ſaid (<hi>Ezra</hi> 9.13.) <hi>Thou haſt puniſhed us leſs than our iniquities deſerve.</hi> And (<hi>Lam.</hi> 3.22.) <hi>It is of the Lords mercies that we are not conſumed.</hi> But the meaning of <hi>double</hi> th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>re, is plainly this, ſhe hath received a very great puniſhment, the Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d hath made her feel the ſorrowful effects of her ſin fully; For ſaid <hi>Daniel</hi> (chap. 9.12.) <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder the whole heaven hath not been done, as hath been done unto</hi> Jeruſalem. This is called a double recompence by another Prophet (<hi>Jerem.</hi> 16.18.) <hi>I will recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence their iniquity, and their ſin double, becauſe they have defiled my land.</hi> And thus <hi>Jeremy</hi> prayed, againſt the oppoſers and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſers of his propheſie (<hi>chap.</hi> 17.18.) <hi>Deſtroy them with double deſtruction.</hi> So then, when it is ſaid, <hi>the Lord added double, or twice as much to</hi> Job <hi>as he had before,</hi> it noteth, at leaſt, a very great addition to the proſperous eſtate which <hi>Job</hi> had before, even in outward things.</p>
                  <pb n="949" facs="tcp:48669:488"/>
                  <p>Hence Obſerve, Firſt;
<q>When we are about ſpirituals, the Lord takes occaſion to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to us in temporals. The Lord not only turned the capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of <hi>Job,</hi> when he prayed for his friends, but gave him twice as much.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Job</hi> did not pray for the doubling of his eſtate, or for great things in the world; we find him many times giving up his hopes as to temporals, when he would not give up his hopes as to ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituals and eternals: <hi>Though he kill me, yet will I truſt in him; he alſo ſhall be my ſalvation.</hi> He ſubmitted his life to God, in hope of a better life, but he had little or no expectation about the things of this life; yet the Lord gave him abundance with his life, as alſo an aboundant, or long life, as we read at the end of this Book. There are two ſpecial reaſons, why the Lord gave <hi>Job</hi> a great increaſe in temporals.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe in thoſe Old Teſtament times the promiſes went much in temporals.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Becauſe <hi>Job</hi> having loſt his credit in the world, when he loſt his eſtate, ſpiritual ſupplies would never have ſet him right in the eye of the world, he had ſuffered, as to his reputation in ſpirituals, by his loſs in temporals; and therefore the Lord doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his eſtate, to vindicate his reputation in the eye of the world. And the Lord did this unſought &amp; unthought of by <hi>Job;</hi> therefore (as the point ſaith) it is a truth, that while we are careful about ſpirituals, the Lord takes care of our temporals (<hi>Mat.</hi> 6.33.) <hi>Seek ye firſt the kingdom of God, and his righteouſneſs, and all theſe things ſhall be added unto you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Note;
<q>The Lord is a bountiful rewarder of his ſervants, and a liberal repairer of their loſſes.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Lord is a bountiful rewarder two ways.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, For what we do, we ſhall not loſe our labour in ſerving him. God gives good and great wages (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.58.) <hi>Be ye ſtedfaſt and unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord; for as-much as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord;</hi> that is, labour abundantly, for your labour ſhall have an aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant reward: Not only ſhall it not be in vain, but richly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded.
<pb n="950" facs="tcp:48669:489"/> 
                     <hi>The Lord is not unrighteous to forget your work and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of love</hi> (Heb. 6.10.) The Lord ſhould be unrighteous to forget our labour of love; not becauſe any labour of ours can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debt him to reward us, but, becauſe he hath freely promiſed to reward us.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Lord is a bountiful rewarder of us for what we ſuffer: And that, Firſt, When we ſuffer under his own hand. Secondly, When for his ſake we ſuffer peaceably and patiently under the hand of men. <hi>Job</hi> was a great ſufferer both ways; he ſuffered greatly under the afflicting hand of God, and he ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed greatly under the violent hands and reproachful tongues of men, and the Lord was to him a bountiful rewarder, with reſpect to both: For he did not only heal his wounded ſtate, and make him up as well as he was before, according to that in (<hi>Jerem.</hi> 30.17.) <hi>I will reſtore health unto thee, and I will heal thy wounds;</hi> but he did it double, inſomuch, that he, who in the days of his former proſperity, was only the greateſt of all the men of the Eaſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came in the days of his latter proſperity, greater than he had been himſelf. The Lord hath plentiful rewards for the godly, and ſo he hath (though of another kind) for the wicked. <hi>He</hi> (ſaith <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid) plentifully rewardeth the proud doer</hi> (Pſal. 31.23.) There is a reward of wrath, as well as a reward of favour. Wrath is the reward of proud men: Thus the Lord will plentifully reward proud <hi>Babilon,</hi> at one time or other, by ſome hand or other (<hi>Revel.</hi> 18.6.) <hi>Reward her, even as ſhe rewarded you, and double unto her double according to her works: In the cup which ſhe hath filled fill to her double. Babilon</hi> ſhall at laſt loſe double blood, for the blood that ſhe hath drawn, yea (as the Text ſaith) <hi>double, double,</hi> that is four times as much; and who knows how much that <hi>double unto her double</hi> means? For 'tis ſaid (<hi>ver.</hi> 7.) <hi>How much ſhe hath glorified her ſelf, and lived deliciouſly, ſo much torment and ſorrow give her.</hi> Now as no man can tell nor imagine, how much ſhe hath glorified her ſelf, nor how deliciouſly ſhe hath lived; ſo no man can tell how much torment and ſorrow ſhe ſhall have! Yea, we read not only of a double, and quadruble, but of a ſeven-fold reward of wrath for evil men (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 79.12.) <hi>Render unto our neighbours ſeven-fold into their boſome.</hi> And ſurely that Scripture means bad neighbours. Now as the Lord
<pb n="951" facs="tcp:48669:489"/> doth plentifully reward the proud and evil doers in a way of wrath, ſo he will plentifully reward well-doers and well-ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, whether under his own hand, or the hand of man, in ways of mercy. And if ſo, then,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Fear not to loſe by God, and that in a two-fold reſpect. Firſt, When he cometh to borrow of you for the poor. <hi>He that hath pity on the poor, lendeth to the Lord</hi> (Prov. 19.17.) Every time we are asked to give to the poor, upon due occaſion, God ſends to borrow of us, and he will ſurely repay what he hath bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed; therefore fear not to loſe by God, when he borrows of you for the poor. Secondly, Fear not to loſe by God, when he takes all from you, and makes you poor. Sometimes God doth not come a borrowing, but he cometh a taking; he will have all, whether you will or no: He will ſometimes take all away by fire, by loſſes at ſea or land; in theſe, and ſuch like caſes, fear not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o be loſers by God: But, Firſt, Truſt him, as <hi>Job</hi> did. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Be patient, as <hi>Job</hi> was. They that have an intereſt in God, and a portion in the promiſe, need not fear they ſhall loſe a thread or a ſhoe-latchet by God, though his providence takes all away, and ſtrips them (as it did <hi>Job</hi>) naked. What God takes from his ſervants, he keeps for them, and will reſtore to them, either in the ſame kind with much more, as he did to <hi>Job</hi> at laſt, or in ſome other kind, which is much better, as he did to <hi>Job</hi> at firſt. While <hi>Job</hi> was deprived of his all worldly good things, God gave him much patience at firſt, ſo that when all was loſt and gone, he could ſay, <hi>Naked came I out of my mothers womb, and naked ſhall I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn thither: The Lord hath given, and the Lord hath taken, bleſſed be the name of the Lord.</hi> While this frame of heart laſted, it was better than all that he had loſt; and though through the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of his pains and temptations, it was ſomewhat abated, and his patience ſomewhat ruffled, yet it was never wholly loſt; and when it was worſt with him, his faith failed not, which was beſt of all.</p>
                  <p>Now what the Apoſtle ſpake concerning thoſe troubles which befel the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the wilderneſs, <hi>They happened for examples</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.11.) So all theſe troubles and takings away, happened to <hi>Job</hi> as our example, or (which the Greek word ſignifieth) as a type, that we ſhould be patient under the Lords hand in taking;
<pb n="952" facs="tcp:48669:490"/> and remember for the encouragement of our faith, the Lords bounty in reſtoring. For this end the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> calleth us to conſider this dealing of God with <hi>Job</hi> (Jam. 5.11.) <hi>Ye have heard of the patience of</hi> Job, <hi>and have ſeen the end of the Lord.</hi> What is that to us (may ſome ſay) that <hi>Job</hi> was patient? Yes, all the matter is to us, it was written for our example and admonition; and ſaith the Apoſtle, ye have not only heard of the patience of <hi>Job,</hi> but <hi>have ſeen the end of the Lord.</hi> Here is an exerciſe of thoſe two noble ſenſes, Hearing and Seeing, mentioned, and doubtleſs for great purpoſes both. But why doth he adde, <hi>ye have ſeen the end of the Lord?</hi> Some interpret theſe words as a ſecond inſtance; the Apoſtle mentioning <hi>Job</hi> in the former words, and Chriſt in theſe, <hi>Ye have ſeen the end of the Lord,</hi> that is, how it was with Chriſt in his ſufferings. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt was well rewarded for all that he ſuffered, <hi>God highly exalted him</hi> (Phil. 2.7.) <hi>becauſe he humbled himſelf, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the croſs.</hi> 'Tis a truth, if we take thoſe latter words of the verſe, <hi>Ye have ſeen the end of the Lord,</hi> for the iſſue of Chriſts ſufferings. But I rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that the whole verſe relateth unto <hi>Job;</hi> and ſo <hi>the end of the Lord</hi> in the latter part, is the end which the Lord made with <hi>Job.</hi> As if the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> had ſaid, <hi>Hath it not been ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your eyes, what end the Lord made with him? or how he gave him double in the end?</hi> Be not afraid to loſe by God, either bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing or taking, for he is a bountiful rewarder.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As we ſhould not be afraid to loſe by God (when he comes either to borrow a part, or (as the caſe was with <hi>Job</hi>) to take all from us) ſo, <hi>let us not be afraid to loſe for God</hi> (which was toucht before, together with the former Inference, upon the 11th verſe of the 41 Chapter.) We have no ground in the world of fear, when all that we have in the world is taken from us for Gods ſake, that is, for righteouſneſs ſake, ſeeing, God who here reſtored to <hi>Job</hi> double, all that himſelf had taken from him, hath alſo promiſed to give his faithful ſervants double for all that is taken from them (upon his account) by men, or which they loſe for him. That's the meaning of the Prophet (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.7.) <hi>For your ſhame ye ſhall have double;</hi> that is, ye having ſuffered ſhame, or been put to ſhame for Gods ſake, or for doing that which is
<pb n="953" facs="tcp:48669:490"/> honourable and commendable in it ſelf, <hi>ſhall receive double.</hi> What double? As by <hi>ſhame</hi> we are to underſtand any evil ſuffered, ſo by <hi>double</hi> any good promiſed as a reward for ſuffering that evil, eſpecially ſuch good as ſtands in direct oppoſition to that evil. As if it had been ſaid, ye ſhall have double honour for ſhame, and double riches for poverty, and double health for ſickneſs, and and double liberty for impriſonment and captivity. 'Tis much to have double reparation of any loſs; yet this doubling is a poor matter to what is promiſed in another place, to thoſe who loſe for God. We have Chriſts word, with an aſſeveration for it (<hi>Mat.</hi> 19.28, 29.) <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, that ye which have followed me in the regeneration, when the Son of man ſhall ſit in the throne of his glory, ye alſo ſhall ſit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Iſrael: And every one that hath forſaken houſes, or brethren, or ſiſters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name ſake,</hi> (here are great ſufferings, but behold a greater reward followeth; not like <hi>Jobs,</hi> twofold, but an hundred-fold; ſo ſaith that Text) <hi>ſhall receive an hundred-fold, and</hi> (which is ten-thouſand-fold more than that) <hi>ſhall inherit everlaſting life.</hi> Be not afraid to loſe for God. <hi>Job</hi> had double, who loſt by God, and ſo may you; but if ye loſe for God, here is an hundred-fold for you. But ſome may ſay, this hundred-fold is a great way off, in the next Life. I anſwer, If it be ſo, yet do not think ye ſhall be loſers; for if ye ſhould never ſee good day more in this world, yet if ye are aſſured of everlaſting life in the world to come, is not that enough? What pitiful ſpirits have they, that are not willing to take their hundred-fold in the life to come! Yet mark it, Jeſus Chriſt doth not put us off ſo neither; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore another Goſpel expreſſeth the promiſe fully, to meet with this objection (<hi>Mark</hi> 10.29, 30.) when ſome told Chriſt, they had left all to follow him, <hi>Jeſus anſwered and ſaid, Verily I ſay unto you, there is no man that hath left houſe, or brethren, or ſiſters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my ſake and the Goſpels, but he ſhall receive an hundred-fold, now in this time, houſes, and brethren, and ſiſters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with perſecutions; and in the world to come, eternal life.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt gives preſent recompences, as well as future; in <hi>this time,</hi> as well as in the time, or rather eternity, to come. And that there is a kind of <hi>Synchroniſm,</hi> or neer joyning, in time of payment and
<pb n="954" facs="tcp:48669:491"/> loſs, of ſuffering and rewarding, ſome have found in the letter; they have had great worldly exaltations, ſoon after their depreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in this world. And Jeſus Chriſt, who made this promiſe, hath made it good in ſpirituals, to the experiences of many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, who have loſt all for him; they have had that at preſent given into their ſouls, which hath been to them, or in their eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, an hundred-fold better than what they loſt. They that have indeed ſuffered loſs for Chriſt, never complained of their ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings or loſſes; they have often triumphed in them, and rejoyced (as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks, 1 Epiſt. 1.8.) <hi>with joy unſpeakable, and full of glory.</hi> If any think they do fooliſhly, who ſuffer world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loſſes for Chriſts ſake, let them remember this return of a hundred-fold, and be aſhamed of their own folly in thinking ſo. It is not fooliſhneſs, but true wiſdom, to loſe much, for the gain of more. Are not they wiſe, who loſe one, upon good aſſurance to get an hundred? have we not Chriſts word for it? and is not that good aſſurance that it ſhall be ſo? Sure, no Merchant can put off his goods at a better market, than he that putteth them all off for God. How rich would men be, if they could get an hundred for one? Such a rich trade hath Chriſt opened, and they are the wiſeſt Merchants now, who venture in it, and will be ſo accounted in the end, even by thoſe who now call them fools and mad-men. That which is loſt for Chriſt, is ſown; and though the ſeed that is caſt into the ground, may ſeem caſt away, yet it will ſpring up again. <hi>Light is ſown for the righteous, and gladneſs for the upright in heart (Pſal.</hi> 97.11.) And what Chriſt ſaith of the good ground, is moſt true in this caſe; that ſeed of light is ſown in ſuch ground as will bring forth, to ſome thirty, to ſome ſixty, to ſome an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred-fold. Therefore, to conclude this Inference, <hi>Be not afraid to loſe for God;</hi> he will not only ſee you indempnified, but (at leaſt) doubly rewarded. <hi>Job,</hi> who once loſt by God, or by the hand of God upon him, was repayed by the ſame hand with him, double in kind; and if we have double in a better kind, double faith in God, and double love to God, and double zeal for God, and double peace in our own conſciences, this is an hundred-fold better than all we can loſe for him, in or of this world.</p>

                  <p>IN the former verſe we have the bleſſed turn of <hi>Jobs</hi> ſtate in general; <hi>The Lord gave him twice as much as he had before:</hi> In this verſe, begins the particular account of <hi>Jobs</hi> reſtorings. There were four things wherein <hi>Job</hi> ſuffered loſs.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, He ſuffered the loſs of his eſtate.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The loſs of his children.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The loſs of his health.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The loſs of his friends.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jobs</hi> repair begins with his laſt loſs; his friends were the laſt that he loſt in the day of his affliction,<note place="margin">Inter adverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates <hi>Jobi</hi> qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſi praecipua e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat quod fuerat ab amicis ſuis deſertus, &amp; ideo hujus adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitatis primò remedium poni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. <hi>Aquin.</hi>
                     </note> but the firſt that he reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in the day of his reſtoration. The firſt budding or ſpring of <hi>Jobs</hi> felicity, after ſo long and ſharp a Winter of ſorrow as he had gone thorough, was, the putting forth of freſh and fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant acts of love from his ancient friends, that of late had forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken him, and left him in the hour of his temptation.</p>
                  <p>This verſe, wherein the account is given about this firſt mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, I may call, or intitle, <hi>The addreſs of Jobs friends,</hi> and in it we may conſider,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, How they are deſcribed, or what they are called. Firſt, as to their relation, <hi>His brethren, his ſiſters, and acquaintance came.</hi> Secondly, in their quantity or number, they came <hi>all:</hi> Here is all, all, all; <hi>All his brethren, and all his ſiſters, and all that had been of his acquaintance before;</hi> there was not one miſſing, not one that forbore to make this friendly addreſs unto him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As we have an account who they were that came to him, ſo what they did when they came; and that is ſet forth
<pb n="956" facs="tcp:48669:492"/> four wayes in this one verſe. Firſt, <hi>They did eat bread with him.</hi> Secondly, <hi>They bemoaned him.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>They comforted him.</hi> Fourthly, <hi>They were very bountiful, and very reſpectful to him; They gave him every one a piece of mony, and every one an ear-ring of gold.</hi> Thus you have the ſtate and parts of this verſe, which I call, <hi>The addreſs of Jobs friends unto him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>Then came there unto him, all his brethren, and all his ſiſters.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Then.</hi> The word in the Hebrew, is the ordinary copulative, <hi>And,</hi> which hath various rendrings in Scripture, according to the ſtate of the place. Here we tranſlate it, <hi>Then,</hi> which may have a double reference. Firſt, to the turn of his captivity, <hi>Then they came.</hi> Secondly, to his prayer for his friends, and the Lords acceptance of him; when God had ſo eminently declared his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to him and his friends, upon his interceſſion, <hi>Then there came unto him,</hi>
                     <q>All his brethren, and all his ſiſters.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Brethren and ſiſters are taken two wayes in Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Strictly; and ſo they that are of, or have the ſame parents, at leaſt, one of them, are brethren and ſiſters.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Brethren and ſiſters are taken largely, for all of the kindred. The kindred of Chriſt, are called his brethren (<hi>Mark</hi> 3.31.) <hi>Then came his brethren, and his mother, ſtanding with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,</hi> that is, his kindred; for whether Chriſt had any brother, in a ſtrict ſence, as born of the ſame Mother, we have nothing from Scripture to affirm; it is generally agreed that he had not, his brethren were his kindred at large. <hi>Abraham</hi> ſpake truly, though not the whole truth (<hi>Gen.</hi> 20.12.) when he called <hi>Sarah</hi> his ſiſter, that is, his kinſwoman. <hi>Moſes</hi> called <hi>Iſrael</hi> brother to the <hi>Edomites,</hi> who were diſtant from that people, many degrees, they deſcending from <hi>Eſau,</hi> theſe from <hi>Jacob (Numb.</hi> 20.14.) <hi>Thus ſaith thy brother Iſrael;</hi> that is, <hi>Iſrael</hi> that is of thy blood, though a great way off, <hi>Iſaac</hi> being their common Father. Thus here, all <hi>Jobs</hi> brethren and ſiſters are all his kindred; and not only theſe, but,
<q>All that were of his acquaintance before.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Hebrew is, <hi>All that knew him before,</hi> that is, had familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="957" facs="tcp:48669:492"/> and converſe with him before. Chriſt (<hi>Mat.</hi> 7.22.) ſaid of thoſe that did ſo hotly preſs acquaintance upon him, <hi>I know you not,</hi> ye are not of thoſe that I know, or have had fellowſhip with, you are none of my acquaintance. So that, there was a collection of all <hi>Jobs</hi> relations and friends at that time, they all flockt to him, and thronged about him, as to and about ſome ſtrange ſight; the fame of his reſtoration was ſoon blown all the Country over. Hence the Septuagint render the words paraphraſtically;<note place="margin">Audierunt om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes fratres, quae cunque ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciderant ei, &amp; venerunt. <hi>Sept.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>All his brethren heard all that had befallen him; and ſo they came.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, where was his wife? There is no mention here of her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn; ſhe had ſpoken as <hi>a fooliſh woman</hi> (Chap. 2.10.) and did not anſwer the duty of her relation after that, as he complained (Chap. 19.17.) <hi>My breath is ſtrange to my wife, though I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated for the childrens ſake of mine own body;</hi> yet doubtleſs ſhe returned to her duty, and honoured him as her head and husband, now at laſt, elſe the mercy had not been compleat, but defective in a very conſiderable part of it.</p>
                  <p>Now, in that <hi>Jobs</hi> reſtoring, or the repair of his loſſes, began with the return of his friends,</p>
                  <p>Obſerve;
<q>The loſs of friends, is a great and grievous loſs.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He that loſeth the affection of friends, loſeth a great poſſeſſion, a great intereſt. Friends indeed are great helps, great helpers; to be in a friendleſs condition, is to be in a helpleſs condition; to have friends, is a very valuable mercy. Let us bleſs God that we have men to friend us, above all, that God is our friend.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Theſe words, <hi>Then came all his brethren,</hi> imply, that when he was in an afflicted condition, none of his friends came at him, neither thoſe that are here called his brethren and ſiſters, nor thoſe that are called his acquaintance.</p>
                  <p>Hence obſerve;
<q>In times of affliction, worldly friends will leave us, and godly friends may prove ſtrange to us.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Doubtleſs, among thoſe brethren, ſiſters and acquaintance of <hi>Job, ſome,</hi> that I ſay not, <hi>many,</hi> were godly, yet even they left him, in the day of his diſtreſs. Men are but men, and they often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſhew themſelves unconſtant to man. As Chriſt had thoſe
<pb n="958" facs="tcp:48669:493"/> that followed him for the loaves,<note place="margin">Amicitia mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di ſequitur marſupium.</note> ſo have we too. <hi>Friendſhip fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth the purſe, the bag;</hi> and when all is gone, ſuch friends are gone. When Chriſt himſelf was in affliction, thoſe that were in neer relation to him, <hi>his very Diſciples,</hi> left him; they all left him, and <hi>Peter</hi> denied him. When the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was in a great affliction, and ſtood as a priſoner, to anſwer for his life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Nero,</hi> his friends durſt not appear; <hi>At my first anſwer</hi> (ſaith he, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.16.) <hi>no man ſtood with me, all men forſook me.</hi> He had not a friend that would own him, nor appear for him, in the time of his affliction and perſecution; and he prayed that God would not lay it to their charge, that they had been thus unfriendly to him.</p>
                  <p>Then, Firſt, Let us not truſt in friends, no, not in a brother; and not only, not in a brother at large, but not in a brother in the ſtricteſt ſence, not in a brother of the ſame blood and bowels with us, no, not in a brother of the ſame faith with us (<hi>Mich.</hi> 7.5.) <hi>Truſt ye not in a friend, put ye not confidence in a guide; keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lyeth in thy boſom.</hi> Truſt not in neereſt friends, no, not in godly friends; they may fail: Though we are to truſt them ſo, as not to ſuſpect them, yet we are not to truſt them ſo, as to rely upon them, or to make them our ſtrength; for then they prove <hi>Egyptian</hi> reeds, which will not only not ſupport, but wound us. That's good counſel (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.21) <hi>Ceaſe ye from man</hi> (let him be who he will, though a brother, though of moſt intrinſick and neereſt acquaintance, though never ſo great and potent, yet ceaſe from him; the reaſon there given, is) <hi>his breath is in his noſtrils;</hi> the man is frail, his life is ſhort and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, he may not laſt long. And we may take another reaſon from the Point in hand; his love is uncertain, as well as his life, and his affections ſeldom laſt long; let us therefore have weaned affections from thoſe that affect us, and are friendly to us.</p>
                  <p>Then, Secondly, <hi>'Tis our wiſdom to get Chriſt for a friend;</hi> he is a friend for ever: He that would have a friend to ſtick to him in adverſity, as well as proſperity, let him get Chriſt to be his friend, who is unchangeable, whoſe love fails not; that's our greateſt and ſureſt intereſt. Chriſt <hi>having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end (John</hi> 13.1.) That's the ſpirit of unfeigned friendſhip (<hi>Prov.</hi> 17.17.) <hi>A friend lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth at all times, and a brother is born for adverſity.</hi> That's true of
<pb n="959" facs="tcp:48669:493"/> a real friend, who lives up to the rule of friendſhip, <hi>He loveth at all times,</hi> and therefore to the end. When the Prophet <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachi</hi> ſaith (Chap. 1.6.) <hi>A ſon honoureth his father,</hi> his meaning is, a ſon ſhould or ought to honour his father, or, a ſon who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his duty, will honour his father; ſo, a friend ought to love at all times, and a true friend will: yet that Scripture in the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs</hi> is chiefly true of Chriſt, and abſolutely true of him only; he alone is ſuch a friend as loves at all times. Hence that divine challenge (<hi>Rom.</hi> 8.35.) <hi>Who ſhall ſeparate us from the Love of Chriſt?</hi> And then the Apoſtle proceeds from <hi>who,</hi> to <hi>what.</hi> As no perſon, ſo no thing, can ſeparate us from the love of Chriſt. <hi>Shall tribulation, or anguiſh, or peril, or ſword?</hi> ſhall theſe ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate us from the love of God? no, theſe ſhall not, theſe cannot; theſe cannot make Chriſt ſtrange to us, nor love us the leſs; he loves in tribulation, as well as out of tribulation; in ſtreights, as well as in our greateſt inlargements; in ſickneſs, as well as in health; in diſgrace with men, as well as when moſt honoured and cryed up by them; when naked, as well as when cloathed; as well in rags, as in the richeſt array. Hence that confident concluſion (<hi>verſ.</hi> 38.) <hi>I am perſwaded, that neither death, nor life,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſhall be able to ſeparate us from the love of God, which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord.</hi> And if ſo, then we ſee where our true intereſt lyeth: Let us make ſure of Chriſt; he will never leave us; all earthly friends may. Friends are a great mercy, but they are not a ſure mercy.</p>
                  <p>Again, Conſider <hi>Jobs</hi> friends, who came not at him when in that afflicted condition; yet as ſoon as ever God turned his cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, and made him proſper in the world, then they would own him, then they came.</p>
                  <p>Hence note, Thirdly;
<q>Such as are no friends in adverſity, will readily ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves friendly in proſperity.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>That they came <hi>then,</hi> is an intimation, if not a proof, that they came not before; but then they came. What Chriſt ſpake in another caſe, I may apply by way of alluſion to this; <hi>Where the carcaſe is, thither will the Eagles be gathered together.</hi> When <hi>Job</hi> was up, his friends appear'd. <hi>All are ready to worſhip the riſing Sun.</hi> When the face of things and times change with us, then the faces of friends change towards us, then they have other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects
<pb n="960" facs="tcp:48669:494"/> and countenances for us; this ſpirit of the world hath been anciently obſerved,<note place="margin">Si fueris foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix multos nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merabis amicos. Tempora ſi fue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rintnubila ſolus eris.</note> even by Heathens; <hi>If you be happy, or reſtored to happineſs, you ſhall number many friends, though you had none before.</hi> Such friends, are like thoſe birds that viſit our coaſts in Summer, when 'tis warm weather, when every thing flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and is green, then ſome birds viſit us, who all the Winter, when 'tis cold, froſt and ſnow, leave us.</p>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ther, it may be conceived, that ſeveral of <hi>Jobs</hi> friends left him, not only upon the occaſion of his poverty and want, but upon the ſuppoſition of his hypocriſie and wickedneſs; many of them might have the ſame opinion of him, which thoſe three had, who particularly dealt with him, that ſurely he was a bad man, becauſe the Lord brought ſo much evil upon him. Now, when the Lord reſtored <hi>Job,</hi> they had another, a better opinion of him, the Lord alſo giving a viſible teſtimony of his accepting <hi>Job.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note, Fourthly;
<q>God will one time or other vindicate the integrity of his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſervants, and ſet them right in the opinion of others.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>God ſuffered <hi>Jobs</hi> integrity to lie under a cloud of ſuppoſed hypocriſie, but at laſt the Lord reſtored him to his credit, as well as to his eſtate, and made his unkind, and not only ſuſpicious, but cenſorious friends, acknowledge that he was upright and faithful. The Lord promiſeth (<hi>Pſalm</hi> 37.6.) <hi>to bring forth the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his ſervants as the light, and their judgement as the noon-day;</hi> that is, a right judgement in others concerning them, as well as the rightneſs of their judgement in what they have done and been, or his own moſt righteous judgement in favour of them. They who had a wrong judgement, and took a falſe meaſure of <hi>Job</hi> (meaſuring him by the outward diſpenſations of God, and judging of his heart by his ſtate, and of his ſpirit by the face of his affairs) theſe were at laſt otherwiſe perſwaded of him. 'Tis, as the way, ſo the ſin and folly of many, to judge upon appearance, upon the appearance of Gods outward dealings; they conclude men good or bad, as their outward condition is good or bad; and therefore, the Lord, to redeem the credit of his faithful ſervants that lye under ſuch miſapprehenſions, ſends proſperity, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſts his gracious acceptance of them, that men of that perverſe opinion may be convinced, and delivered out of their error.</p>
                  <pb n="961" facs="tcp:48669:494"/>
                  <p>Note Fifthly;
<q>The Lords favouring us, or turning the light of his countenance towards us, can ſoon cauſe men to favour us, and ſhine upon us.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>See what a change the Lord made at that time, both in the ſtate of things, and in the hearts of men, when the Lord outwardly forſook <hi>Job;</hi> friends forſook him, children mockt him, acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance deſpiſed him, his very ſervants ſlighted him: yet no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er did the Lord return in the manifeſtations of his favour, but they all returne, deſiring to ingratiate themſelves with him, and ſtrive who ſhall engage him moſt. God can quickly give us new friends, or reſtore the old.<note place="margin">Exple<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">

When God manifeſts his favour, he can command our favour with men. Though that which is a real motive of the Lords favour to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, their holineſs, and holy walkings, gets them many enemies, and they are hated for it by many; yet the Lord diſcovering or owning the graces of his ſervants, by ſignal favours, often gets them credit, and ſets them right in the opinion of men. Thus it was with <hi>Job;</hi> all his friends returned to him, upon the Lords high reſpect to him in turning his captivity.</p>
                  <p>Again, in that <hi>Jobs</hi> friends came to him,<note place="margin">Cui dominus fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet, ei omnia favent.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Obſerve, Sixthly;
<q>It is the duty of friends to be friendly, to come to and viſit one another.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is a duty to do ſo in both the ſeaſons, or in all the changes of our life: It is a duty to do ſo in times of proſperity, when God ſhines upon our Tabernacle. When any receive extraordinary mercies, it is the duty of friends to ſhew them extraordinary courteſies, and to bleſs God for them, and with them. When <hi>Elizabeths neighbours and couſins heard how the Lord had ſhewed great mercy upon her, they rejoyced with her</hi> (Luke 1.58.) It is a duty to rejoyce with thoſe that rejoyce, and to come to them that we may rejoyce with them. It is a duty alſo to viſit thoſe that mourn, and to mourn with them. Friendly viſits are a duty in all the ſeaſons of our lives.</p>
                  <p>Once more. <hi>Then came all his brethren, &amp;c.</hi> It was late e're they came, but they came.</p>
                  <p>Hence Note;
<q>It is better to perform a duty late, than not at all.</q>
                  </p>

                  <p>They had a long time, even all the time of his long affliction, neglected, or at leaſt ſlackned this duty of viſiting <hi>Job;</hi> yet they did not reaſon thus with themſelves; It is in vain to viſit him now, or our viſiting him now may be thought but a flattering with him, or a fawning upon him: No, though they had neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him before, they would not add new to their old incivilities. We ſay of repentance (w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is a coming to God) <hi>Late repentance is ſeldom true, yet true repentance is never too late.</hi> None ſhould think it too late to come to God, though they have long neglected him; nor ſhould ſinners, who have long neglected God, be diſcouraged: Though it be beſt for us, and our duty, to repent betimes; yet God will not refuſe a ſinner at any time, who indeed repents. Now as late repentance, ſo any late duty, is better than none, or than a total neglect of it. <hi>Jobs</hi> friends came to him, though late, and were friendly received. But what came they for? or what did they when they came? That's ſet forth in four things, as was ſhewed in opening the Text.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The Text tells us, <hi>They did eat bread with him in his houſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall not ſtay upon that nicety which ſome take notice of, that when bread and water are named together, they alwayes ſignifie poor fare (1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.4.) <hi>Obadiah</hi> fed the Prophets whom he ſecured from the fury of <hi>Jezabel</hi> in Caves, <hi>with bread and water:</hi> He could not feaſt them there, but gave them what might keen them alive. So that threatning (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 3.1.) imports they ſhould not have neceſſaries. But when bread is put alone, that ſignifieth (ſay they) a full, or at leaſt, a very competent and comfortable proviſion (2 <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>m.</hi> 9.7.) And ſo to eat bread together is to feed liberally together. Yet I find theſe two, bread and water, put together, and ſignifying a full Table in one place of Scripture. When that <hi>Syrian</hi> Army, ſmitten with blindneſs, was led by <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſha</hi> into <hi>Samaria,</hi> the Prophet ſaid (2 <hi>Kinge</hi> 6.22.) <hi>Set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink;</hi> then it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>he</hi> (that is, the King of <hi>Iſrael) prepared great proviſions for them.</hi> The greatneſs of the proviſion which the King p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Did eat bread with him.</hi> Not the bread of mourners (as ſome expound) of which we read (<hi>Deut.</hi> 26.14. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 9.4.) but the bread of rejoycers. I ſhall not omit to mind the Reader of what one of the Ancients meditated upon this paſſage. <hi>Job</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>doth here prefigure Chriſt after his reſurrection, reſtored to his honours, and honoured, not only by his Apoſtles, but alſo by the fathers, both Jewes and Gentiles; the faithful flocking to him, and feaſting with him in his houſe the Church, there with ſorrow remembring his ſufferings, and in that heavenly Court eating with him the bread of life.</hi> Chriſt after his reſurrection called his Apoſtles to <hi>eat bread with him;</hi> as here, after <hi>Jobs</hi> reſtitution, which may be called his reſurrection, 'tis ſaid, All his friends <hi>came and did eat bread with him in his houſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence Note;
<q>For friends to eat, yea, to feaſt ſoberly together, is not only law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but ſomtimes a duty.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The creatures are given to us, not only for our neceſſity, but for our comfort, and to maintain ſociety. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith (<hi>Eccl.</hi> 8.15.) <hi>Then I commended mirth, becauſe a man hath no better a thing under the Sun, than to eat, and drink, and to be merry.</hi> He ſpeaks not of a ſenſual mirth and eating, like voluptuous Epicures, but of eating with gladneſs and ſingleneſs of heart, as 'tis noted of the Primitive Saints (Acts 2.46.) There is no worldly thing better than to eat and drink <hi>with ſobriety</hi> in the uſe of the creature, and with <hi>ſingleneſs</hi> of heart one towards another. <hi>To uſe what we have, is better than the having of it.</hi> To eat together is good, with theſe limitations or cautions. Firſt, if we eat to the glory of God (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31.) Secondly, if we eat with joy in God (<hi>Eccl.</hi> 9.7.) Thirdly, if we eat taſting and remembring the goodneſs of God (<hi>Deut.</hi> 6.11, 12.) Fourthly, if we eat fearing to offend God, and wrong our ſelves with acceſs (<hi>Prov.</hi> 23.1, 2. Luk. 21.34.) Fifthly, if we have a ſenſe of the afflictions of others (<hi>Amos</hi> 6.6.) eſpecially of thoſe who have nothing to eat. Sixthly, if we eat with thankfulneſs, or giving thanks to God, who ſatisfies our hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger (<hi>Mark</hi> 8.6. <hi>John</hi> 6.11.) Seventhly, if we eat with chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſs, giving a portion of what we have in plenty, to thoſe that are in want and hungry (<hi>Jam.</hi> 2.15, 16.)</p>
                  <pb n="964" facs="tcp:48669:496"/>
                  <p>Again, They came to eat bread <hi>with Job in his houſe.</hi> See the nobleneſs of <hi>Jobs</hi> ſpirit. Doubtleſs, when they came they made their Apologies, pleaded their excuſe, and confeſſed that they had failed in friendſhip, and had not lived up to the law of love. Courteous and noble ſpirited <hi>Job</hi> took all well, paſt by all diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſies, welcomed and embraced them: He did not only not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid them with former unkindneſſes, why came ye not to me in the day of my trouble and affliction, in the day of my diſtreſs and ſorrow? where were ye? Thus ſome would have rounded them; ye come to me when all is well with me; but where were ye when I wanted comfort and company? <hi>Job,</hi> I ſay, did not only not upbraid them with their former unkindneſſes, when they came to him, but took their coming kindly. When the Elders of <hi>Gilead</hi> came to <hi>Jepthah,</hi> to deſire him to be their Captain againſt the children of <hi>Ammon,</hi> he ſaid (<hi>Judg.</hi> 11.7.) <hi>Did not ye hate me, and expel me out of my fathers houſe? and why are ye come unto me now when ye are in diſtreſs? Jepthah</hi> caſt their ill carriage towards him in their teeth, and only not rejected them and their requeſt. Thus <hi>Job</hi> might have ſaid, why did you leave me in the time of my diſtreſs? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but we have no ſuch language from this good man, not a word of that.</p>
                  <p>Hence Note;
<q>It becomes us to accept the love of formerly unkind friends, and not to twit them in the teeth with their unkindneſſes.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Job</hi> well underſtood that it was a part of his tryal and burden from God, that his friends forſook him, and were once uncivil to him: therefore he would not burden them with it. A godly man conſiders, it is of the Lord if friends prove unfriendly to him, and that it is for tryal whether he can truſt upon and cleave unto God alone when friends leave him. Thus to receive unfriendly friends is to be perfect (in our meaſure) as God is perfect. How un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindly have we dealt with God! and yet when we come to him he accepts of us. They that are ſenſible how they have refuſed the Lord ſomtimes, and that he hath yet graciouſly accepted of them, they (I ſay) will be ready to accept of friends that have been froward and unkind to them: It is much the will of God, that we ſhould do ſo, and 'tis a great part of our conformity unto God when we do ſo. It was very well that <hi>Job</hi> gave fair reſpect to his friends, and treated them lovingly when they came to him;
<pb n="965" facs="tcp:48669:496"/> and it was well, and but their duty that they came to him.</p>
                  <p>Yet this was not all they did; <hi>Jobs</hi> friends did not only come and eat bread with him (thar had been but according to the cuſtom of common friends) they went further,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>They bemoaned him.</hi> That's the ſecond friendly office which they did him. The word ſignifies, <hi>to ſhake the head;</hi> ſo the Latine Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation renders it, <hi>His friends came to him, and moved their heads over him,</hi> ſo expreſſing their compaſſion.<note place="margin">Moverunt ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per eum caput. <hi>Vulg.</hi> Conſolati ſunt eum et mirati ſunt ſuper om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> That geſture of moving the head, was uſed ſomtimes in deriſion, ſomtimes in admiration, in which latter ſenſe the Septuagint take it here, <hi>They comforted him, and wondered at all the evills that God had brought upon him.</hi> It might well move wonder, that ſo good a man ſhould ſuffer ſo much evil; yet this geſture of ſhaking the head, is rarely, if at all uſed in way of admiration; whereas, in way of compaſſion,<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <p>Hence Note;
<q>It is our duty to pity and bemoan the afflicted.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>We read of Ephraim <hi>bemoaning himſelf</hi> (Jer. 31.18.) and there is a twofold bemoaning of our ſelves. Firſt, With reſpect to the ſins that we have committed. Secondly, There is a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moaning of our ſelves, as to our afflictions; and poſſibly both are to be underſtood in that place concerning <hi>Ephraim.</hi> 'Tis a duty alſo with reſpect to others; we ought to bemoan thoſe that are in ſufferings, and thoſe that have ſinned, as well as our own ſins or ſufferings. And though, that which gives us the greateſt occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of bemoaning others is their ſin, yet 'tis a great duty alſo to bemoan thoſe that are under ſufferings, and to have bowels of compaſſion, or a fellow feeling of their afflictions.</p>
                  <p>But it may be objected, what need had <hi>Jobs</hi> brethren to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moan him now that he was delivered out of his afflictions, and his captivity turned? were not theſe bemoanings improper and unſeaſonable?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, Firſt, Though <hi>Job</hi> was come out of his afflictions, yet he was but very lately come out of them; he was yet, as it were, upon the borders of ſorrow, and was come only a ſtep out
<pb n="966" facs="tcp:48669:497"/> of his troubles; ſo that his tears were then ſcarce wiped away, or dryed up, and the ſorrow of his late adverſity was even forced to intermingle with the joy of his newly begun proſperity: The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of his affliction was, doubtleſs, yet very ſtrong upon him, and the pain of it ſcarce off him; he had, as yet, a taſt of the wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mwood and gall of that moſt bitter cup, of which he had, a little before, drank ſo deeply; his wound was but in healing, not quite healed; and therefore they might well bemoan him, as to his former afflictions, in that morning or day-break of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. Joy and ſorrow uſe to conflict together, and ſtrive for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, whether the one ſhall keep, or the other get the ground, at the beginning of all great changes.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, This act of <hi>Jobs</hi> friends in bemoaning of him, might reſpect not only the abiding ſenſe of his former affliction, but the ſharpneſs, and ſoreneſs of it, while it was upon him; ſo that, as his own remembrance of his former ſufferings might ſtill hang upon him, ſo while his brethren, and other viſitants, remembred how grievous and tedious his ſufferings had been, it might well ſtir their compaſſions, and cauſe them to bemoan him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Job</hi> had none to bemoan him, while the affliction was actually upon him; <hi>Have pity upon me, have pity upon me,</hi> ſaid he in the 16th Chapter, yet found little or no pity from any: Now that being a great part of his ſuffering, that he had none to pity him while he ſuffered; the Lord ſent his brethren to him, when he was new come out of his ſufferings, to perform that duty to him, which ſhould have been done him while he ſuffered.</p>
                  <p>Further, Becauſe we ought not only to pity and bemoan our friends in adverſity, but to help them out, and make a perfect cure; therefore <hi>Jobs</hi> friends proceed to that duty alſo: For, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bemoaned him, the text ſaith,
<q>They comforted him.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>That is, they uſed all the means they could to comfort him, they gave him comfortable words, cordial conſolations. <hi>Job</hi> himſelf had been a great comforter of others (as <hi>Eliphaz</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in the 4th Chapter) and now he hath his comforters; even they comforted him concerning his former miſeries, who former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had been miſerable comforters.</p>
                  <pb n="967" facs="tcp:48669:497"/>
                  <p>From the method of their proceeding; Firſt, They bemoan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him; and, Secondly, They comforted him,</p>
                  <p>Note;
<q>We can never truly comfort others, till we have pitied others.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Comforting begins at pittying. It is poſſible to pity one, and not to comfort him: Some will give bemoaning words, yet are not able to miniſter real comforts; ſo then, there may be pittying without comforting, but there cannot be comforting without pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tying. God himſelf is thus expreſt (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.3, 4.) Firſt, He is called, <hi>The father of mercies,</hi> that is, he is full of pity, full of compaſſionate bowels. And then, Secondly, He is called, <hi>The God of all conſolation.</hi> He is a comforting God, becauſe a pittying God. If God were not pitiful and compaſſionate, we ſhould have to comfort from him: ſo it is with men, if we pity not others we cannot comfort them. <hi>Job</hi> called his friends <hi>miſerable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forters</hi> (chap. 16.2.) They came to mourn <hi>with him, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort him</hi> (chap. 2.11.) but had they more affectionately mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him, they would have more effectually comforted him. They did not pity him enough in his miſery, and ſo they proved but miſerable comforters to him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, From the work it ſelf,</p>
                  <p>Obſerve;
<q>To comfort thoſe that are in affliction is our duty, and a work of charity.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>To miniſter comfort to the ſorrowful, is a greater point of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, than to miniſter bread to the hungry, or clothing to the naked. As the ſoul is better than the body, ſo thoſe acts of charity, which offer relief to the ſoul in any kind, are better than thoſe by which the body is relieved. Though to give bread be more coſtly to us than good wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ds (we uſe to ſay good words are cheap) yet good and comfortable words are worth much more than bread, they are better than gold, yea, than fine gold, ſweeter alſo than the honey, and the honey-comb. The Apoſtle gave this duty in charge to believers (1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.11.) <hi>Comfort your ſelves together, and edifie one another.</hi> And at the 14th verſ. <hi>Now we exhort you bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feeble minded, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
<pb n="968" facs="tcp:48669:498"/> the weak.</hi> The <hi>weak,</hi> in the latter words, are the ſame with the <hi>feeble</hi> in the former; and the <hi>ſupport</hi> ſpoken of in the one, is nothing elſe but the comfort ſpoken of in the other. Comfort to a feeble mind, is like a prop or a pillar to a feeble building, the ſupporter of it.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe it is ſo important a work, to comfort feeble minds I ſhall briefly name ſome ſpecial caſes, wherein the mind of man is feeble, and then hint what word of comfort is moſt proper for its ſupport, in each caſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, If the mind be infeebled by outward wants, apply that comfortable Scripture (<hi>Mat.</hi> 6.32, 33.) <hi>Your father knoweth that ye have need of thoſe things;</hi> which if received by faith will give the mind great ſupport in that caſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, In caſe of the loſs or death of friends; the Apoſtle hath put words into our mouths for the comforting of ſuch (1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.13.) chiefly theſe two ways. Firſt, By remembring that their friends are only <hi>aſleep in Jeſus,</hi> or gone to ſleep in the boſome of Jeſus. Secondly, That they ſhall be raiſed again at the coming of Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, In caſe of ſuffering and perſecution, read comfort and ſupport, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.11, 12, 13. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.12, 13, 14.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, In caſe of bodily ſickneſs, or any chaſtenings from the hand of God, we have a ſtore or treaſure of comforting words, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. from the 5. to the 14th verſe.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, In caſe of deſertion, or Gods hiding his face, take comfort from <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.10. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.7, 8.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, When any are under the ſence of divine wrath for ſin, they may take comfort by meditating all thoſe Scriptures which hold out the free grace of God to ſinners, and the full ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction which Chriſt hath made for ſin to the juſtice of God, and ſo for deliverance from the wrath which is to come (1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.10.) Theſe are the principal caſes wherein we need a comforter; and moſt of theſe, if not all, met in <hi>Jobs</hi> caſe. He was poor and had loſt all, that was the firſt caſe; his children were dead, that was the ſecond; he was perſecuted, vexed, and reproached, that was a third; he was ſick and weak in body, that was a fourth; he was under grievous deſertions, that was a fifth; he was alſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſence of wrath, the arrows of the Almighty drunk up his
<pb n="969" facs="tcp:48669:498"/> ſpirits. All theſe evils God brought upon him, and ſome of them in the higheſt degree; and though he were then got out of them all, yet (as was ſaid before) being got but a little way out of them he needed comfort; and therefore his new-come old friends and acquaintance, bemoaned and comforted him, as a man newly come out of great affliction.</p>
                  <p>And we ſhould be much in this duty of comforting others upon theſe conſiderations.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Comfort upholds the ſoul, when burdened or weakned, from ſinking.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Comfort quiets the ſoul, when toſt up and down as with a tempeſt; comforts wiſely and ſeaſonably miniſtred will make a great calm. Comfort is the repoſe and reſt of the ſoul.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Comfort quickens and revives the ſoul when dying away with ſorrow; comforts are cordials: <hi>For which cauſe we faint not</hi> (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.16.) And what the cauſe was which kept them from fainting, we may find both in the verſe, going before, in thoſe words, <hi>All things are for your ſakes</hi> (verſ. 15.) or in the verſe following, <hi>Our light affliction, &amp;c.</hi> (ver. 17.) Comforts either pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent and keep us from qualms and ſwoonings, or bring us out of them again. <hi>Give wine to him that is of a heavy heart; let him drink and forget his ſorrow</hi> (Prov. 30.6, 7.) Give him this wine of comfort, and it will renew his ſpirit more than wine.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Comfort confirms and eſtabliſheth the ſoul, when we are ready to let go our hold. The Apoſtle ſent <hi>Timotheus, to eſtabliſh and comfort</hi> the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> concerning their faith (1 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 3.2.) that is, to eſtabliſh them in the faith (both in the doctrine and grace of faith) by comforting them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jobs</hi> friends might ſee cauſe of comforting him upon many conſiderations, poſſibly upon moſt of theſe: The Text ſaith only, <hi>They comforted him</hi>
                     <q>Over all the evil which the Lord had brought upon him.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The plaiſter was as broad as the ſoar, or they adminiſtred as many plaiſters as there was ſoars; <hi>They comforted him over all the evil,</hi> &amp;c. This directs us to a great point of holy prudence in comforting the ſorrowful, even to comfort them in or about every thing, which hath been an occaſion of their ſorrow. When we are to ſtop the
<pb n="970" facs="tcp:48669:499"/> holes of a leaking veſſel, if we ſtop three or four, and leave but one, we indanger all the liquor in the veſſel; you were as good ſtop none at all, as not ſtop all: ſo it is in this caſe; therefore ſee how wiſely <hi>Jobs</hi> friends carried it, <hi>They comforted him over all the evil</hi>
                     <q>Which the Lord had brought upon him.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And all that was the evil of ſuffering. The Lord is the bringer of ſuch evils upon all that ſuffer them, even upon his deareſt and moſt faithful ſervants; thoſe evils come from him who is only good, and altogether good: The Lord takes theſe evils to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>I create evil</hi> (Iſa. 45.7.) and faith the Prophet (<hi>Amos</hi> 3.6.) <hi>Shall there be evil in a City, and the Lord hath not done it?</hi> As the Lord owns theſe kind of evils, ſo we honour God in acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him the Author of them. Our croſſes are of God, as well as our comforts; our poverty, as well as our riches; our ſickneſs, as well as our health. This point hath occurred more than once from other paſſages in this Book, and therefore I ſhall adde no more now.</p>
                  <p>This was the third labour of love which the brethren of <hi>Job</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon him, <hi>They comforted him over all the evil which the the Lord had brought upon him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet this was not all, they did not only beſtow a <hi>mouthful</hi> of good words upon him (I ſpeak not lightly of good words, they are a weighty piece of charity) Good words are much better (as was toucht before) than gold and ſilver, and may be much more beneficial and uſeful to the receiver, than thouſands of gold and ſilver: Yet, I ſay, <hi>Jobs</hi> friends did not only beſtow a mouthful of good words upon him, for the removal of his inward grief, but they brought their <hi>handsful</hi> of good things to beſtow upon him, for the making up of his outward loſſes; and this was the fourth act or office of love which they did him, as it followeth,
<q>Every man alſo gave him a piece of money, and every one an ear-ring of gold.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here was real kindneſs, as well as verbal. Though good words (as was ſaid) be a great charity, yet 'tis no charity to give nothing but good words where more is needed, unleſs this be our caſe, that indeed we have nothing more to give. The charity of ſome
<pb n="971" facs="tcp:48669:499"/> is only in words, to thoſe who are in extream need of more; and it is only ſo, not becauſe they have no more in their hands to give, but, becauſe they have no hearts to give more. To ſay to a naked or hungry one, be clothed and ſed, or to give a large parcel of condoling and bemoaning words, and then do nothing, no not give a Doit, for the ſupply of his wants; is this love or charity? <hi>Jobs</hi> friends loved him now, not in word and in tongue only, but indeed and in truth; their deeds ſhewed the truth of their love.</p>
                  <q>They gave him every one of them a piece of money.</q>
                  <p>There are two readings of this clauſe. The word which we here render <hi>a piece of money,</hi> ſignifies alſo <hi>a ſheep;</hi> according to which Maſter <hi>Broughton</hi> tranſlates, and ſo do others,<note place="margin">Dederunt ei quiſque pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem unam. <hi>Bez.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>They gave him each one a lamb,</hi> we ſay, <hi>a piece of money;</hi> the ſame word ſignifying both, as is plain from other Scriptures (<hi>Gen.</hi> 37.19.) <hi>And he</hi> (that is, <hi>Jacob) bought a parcel of a field, where he had ſpread his tent at the hand of the children of</hi> Hamor, Shechems <hi>father, for an hundred pieces of money,</hi> or <hi>lambs,</hi> as we put in the Margin. The ſame thing is reported again, in the ſame words (<hi>Joſh.</hi> 24.32.) Now the reaſon why that word is rendred both a lamb and a piece of money, is, ſay ſome, becauſe money in thoſe times, bare the ſtamp or figure of a lamb upon it; as in ſome times and places money or coin was ſtamped with the figure of an oxe; from whence came that Proverb, <hi>The oxe is upon his tongue,</hi> that is, he ſpeaks <hi>as he is bribed.</hi> A ſecond reaſon given of it, is, becauſe the riches of the Antients was moſt in cattle;<note place="margin">Recunia à pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>core dicta eſt. <hi>Plin.</hi> l. <hi>18.</hi> c. <hi>3.

                     </note> and that kind of riches being as money, by which all things are valued, and by which they made their payments, therefore the ſame word was uſed for cattel, and for coin or money. The La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine word for <hi>money</hi> is alſo derived from another, which ſignifies <hi>cattle.</hi> And it is reported by <hi>Pliny,</hi> that <hi>Severus</hi> firſt ſtampt money with the effigies or image of ſheep and oxen.</p>
                  <q>They gave him every one a piece of money, <hi>or a lamb.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>Some are moſt for that reading, <hi>they gave him a lamb,</hi> becauſe that ſeems moſt anſwerable to the loſs of <hi>Job;</hi> he loſt all his cattle, and now every one brought him a lamb: But it is not much to the matter, whether we take their reading or ours. If it were a
<pb n="972" facs="tcp:48669:500"/> lamb, it was worth a piece of money; and if it were a piece of money, it would buy a lamb.</p>
                  <p>But, why did they bring <hi>Job</hi> either a <hi>piece of money</hi> or <hi>a lamb?</hi> I anſwer.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To teſtifie their renewed friend-ſhip, or as a ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their love, and ſo to ingratiate themſelves with him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It might be towards the repair of his loſſes; every one brought him ſomewhat; yet I conceive they beſtowed thoſe gifts upon him, rather as an honour than a relief, yet poſſibly they might intend both in giving them. Upon the one account or the other, or upon both, the Lord brought over <hi>Jobs</hi> friends to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate him with theſe preſents. It hath been an ancient uſage to preſent Princes with gifts in way of honour and homage, as appears plainly from what is of the refuſal of ſome called <hi>Sons of Belial</hi> (a Title of diſgrace beſtowed by the Spirit of God upon none but the worſt of men) to bring preſents unto <hi>Saul,</hi> the firſt King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.27.) And many ſuperiors in any kind think themſelves ſlighted, if they have not gifts from their infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors. <hi>Job</hi> was a Prince, the greateſt man of the Eaſt, and for that reaſon it was but a duty in his friends to bring him preſents. <hi>Every one gave him a piece of money (or a lamb)</hi>
                     <q>And every one an ear-ring of gold.</q>

                  </p>
                  <pb n="973" facs="tcp:48669:500"/>
                  <p>Hence Note, Firſt;
<q>To ſend or bring gifts in many caſes, is not only lawful, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and a duty.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though both the giving and taking of gifts, heareth ill, in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and common language, yet there are ſix ſorts of gifts which may lawfully be given and taken; and there is a ſeventh ſort, which none ought either to give or take.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Gifts of pure charity, or <hi>Eleemoſinary gifts,</hi> ſuch as are beſtowed upon, and diſtributed among the poor, are a duty. We ſhould be much in gifts of charity for this very reaſon; becauſe to give them is not ſo much a bounty, as a duty: A part of all we have, is due to thoſe that have nothing.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There are gifts of reſpect to thoſe who are not in want, yea, to thoſe who abound; theſe are <hi>honorary gifts.</hi> 'Tis law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and a duty alſo to bring gifts to Kings and Princes, as was ſhewed in opening the words. When Chriſt is ſpoken of as a King, the Scripture ſaith, <hi>The Kings of</hi> Tarſhiſh, <hi>and of the Iſles ſhall bring preſents; the Kings of</hi> Sheba <hi>and</hi> Seba <hi>ſhall offer gifts (Pſal.</hi> 72.10.) And as that holy Propheſie ſaith it ſhould be ſo, ſo the holy Hiſtory ſaith it was ſo; the wiſe men of the Eaſt came with gifts to Chriſt, as ſoon as he was born (<hi>Mat.</hi> 2.)</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, There are gifts of courteſie from equals. One friend ſends a gift to another, in teſtimony of love and kindneſs, or as rejoycing in the goodneſs and kindneſs of God to them, in deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering them from any evil (as <hi>Jobs</hi> caſe alſo was) Theſe are <hi>congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulatory gifts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, There are gifts of bounty, ſuch are from ſuperiors to inferiors, to teſtifie their greatneſs and magnificence.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, There are gratulatory gifts, in token of thankfulneſs for benefits and favours received.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, There are gifts of incouragement to thoſe that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious and deſerve well, which we may call <hi>remunerative gifts:</hi> Theſe are as oil to the wheel of ingenuous ſpirits in a good work; it is lawful at any time, and ſometimes neceſſary, to beſtow ſuch gifts.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, There are gifts of bribery, which pervert juſtice, and put out the eyes of Judges: They are not the rewards of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, but the wages of unrighteouſneſs; ſuch as <hi>Balack</hi> would

Let all take heed of giving or taking gifts to pervert juſtice, or to encourage any in the doing of any wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or unworthineſs; theſe are <hi>corruptive gifts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Further, Whereas they gave not only <hi>a piece of money or a lamb,</hi> but every one an <hi>ear-ring of gold;</hi> which we may conſider not only as to the matter, as it was gold, but as to the form, as it was <hi>an ear-ring,</hi> or an artificial piece of gold, &amp; that an ornamental piece of gold; they might have given gold (and probably they did) in the pieces of money which they gave him, but they gave him ear-rings alſo, in which the faſhion or uſe is moſt conſiderable, and the workmanſhip more worth than the mettal.</p>
                  <p>Hence, Note;
<q>It is lawful to wear ornaments.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Not only may we wear that which ſerves for a covering to the body, but that which is for the adorning of it. An ear-ring is an ornament. As all are to wear cloths to hide their ſhame and naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſo ſome may wear robes, to ſhew their ſtate and greatneſs. <hi>Job</hi> received ear-rings; he did not caſt them by as vain things. When <hi>Abraham</hi> ſent his ſervant to take a wife for his Son <hi>Iſaac,</hi> he ſtored him with cabinets of precious jewels to beſtow upon her (<hi>Gen.</hi> 24.) and when he found <hi>Rebeccah</hi> at the well, and found who ſhe was, he <hi>took a golden ear-ring of half a ſhekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten ſhekels weight of gold, and gave them to Rebeccah.</hi> And afterwards, when her parents had given conſent to the marriage, then (<hi>ver.</hi> 53.) <hi>The ſervant brought forth jewels of ſilver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebeccah,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Abraham</hi> would not ſend ſuch things to a Wife for his Son, had they been vain in their own nature, or ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in their uſe. Yet take the point with theſe cautions. We may wear ornaments, but,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, We muſt not be proud of them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We muſt not ſet our affections upon them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, We muſt beware of an affectation in wearing them.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, We muſt take heed of waſtfulneſs; we may not laviſh out an eſtate upon ornaments, nor make our ſelves poor, to make our ſelves fine.</p>
                  <pb n="975" facs="tcp:48669:502"/>
                  <p>I grant ſome Scriptures ſpeak negatively in appearance, as to the uſe and wearing of jewels and ornaments (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.9.) <hi>In like manner alſo let women adorn themſelves in modeſt aparel, in ſhame faſtneſs and ſobriety, not with broidened hair or gold, or pearl, or caſtly array.</hi> This Scripture ſeems to croſs the point directly, and ſo doth that other (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.3.) <hi>Whoſe adorning</hi> (ſpeaking of women) <hi>let it not be that outward adorning of plating the hair, and of wearing of gold, and of putting on of aparel; but let it be the hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den man of the heart.</hi> How then can good women wear theſe ornaments?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, Theſe Scriptures do not abſolutely forbid the wearing of ornaments, but only as to thoſe exceptions before given, to wear them in pride, or to ſet our affections upon them, or to affect them, or to wear them waſtfully, beyond our purſe and place; ſuch wearing of ornaments is indeed unlawful. Again, it is not ſinful to have or uſe ornaments, but to make them our orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that is ſinful; our adorning muſt be the hidden man of the heart, that muſt be grace: That this is the Apoſtles mind is clear, becauſe he ſaith their <hi>adorning muſt not be the putting on of apparrel,</hi> as well as not the plating of the hair, and wearing of gold. Therefore the negation is not abſolute, but comparative; let not them count theſe their ornaments, but grace or the hidden man of the heart. As the Lord ſaith, <hi>I will have mercy and not ſacrifice,</hi> that is, mercy rather than ſacrifice; ſo, I will have the hidden man of the heart, not coſtly jewels and apparel, your orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; that is, I eſteem the one much rather than the other, and ſo ought you to eſteem both your ſelves and others accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.</p>
                  <p>Take this caution further. Times of affliction and ſuffering, are very unſeaſonable to wear ear-rings of gold and ornaments. When there is any great appearance of the diſpleaſure of God againſt a people; then how unſutable are all our pleaſant things! The Lord ſaid to the people of Iſrael, <hi>Put off your ornaments, that I may know what to do with you</hi> (Exod. 32.) When we live in ſuch a time, in humbling days, or are called to humbling duties, we ſhould be very watchful about theſe things, and rather appear in raggs than robe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, with duſt upon our heads, rather than with orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon our backs.</p>
                  <pb n="976" facs="tcp:48669:503"/>
                  <p>Thus far of the firſt part of <hi>Jobs</hi> reſtauration, the return of his friends, and the ſignifications of their friendlineſs towards him, eating bread with him, bemoaning him, comforting him, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting him with gifts of honour, if not of enrichment, pieces of money, and earings of gold: Yet all their civilities and bounties reached but a little way, if at all towards that reſtauration which the Lord intended him, the doubling of his whole eſtate, which he ſoon received in full meaſure, heaped up, preſſed down, and running over, as will appear in opening the two next verſes, and thoſe which follow to the end of the chapter.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, a wiſhing or deſiring of a bleſſing: We are not thus to underſtand it here, as if the Lord did only wiſh a bleſſing upon <hi>Job.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, There is a commanding of a bleſſing, and ſo we are to underſtand it here. <hi>The Lord bleſſed,</hi> that is, the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded a bleſſing, or effectually poured out a bleſſing upon <hi>Job.</hi> The word <hi>bleſſed (The Lord bleſſed)</hi> hath two things in it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It implyeth plenty and abundance, a copious and a large proviſion of good things. For as the word <hi>[abundare]</hi> in Latine, and <hi>to abound</hi> in Engliſh,<note place="margin">Sicut abundare ab undis Latinè dicunt; ita vide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri poſſunt He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braei <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> quaſi affluenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am denominare à fonte aut piſcina, quam appellant <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recah.</hi>
                     </note> comes (ſay Grammarians <hi>ab unda</hi>) from <hi>water,</hi> becauſe waters abound and flow; ſo this Hebrew word <hi>[Beracah]</hi> which ſignifieth a bleſſing, comes from, or at leaſt, is near in ſound to the word <hi>Berecah,</hi> which ſignifieth a Fiſh-pond, where there is a great confluence of waters, and a great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of fiſhes, or, a Fountain, from whence waters flow conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually. So that to bleſs, notes the bringing in of abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, or of a great increaſe, like the waters of a Fiſh-pond, or Fiſh in the waters. To increaſe as Fiſh, is to increaſe abundantly. It is ſaid of the Children of <hi>Iſrael, They multiplyed like fiſh</hi> (that's the ſignificancy of the word uſed <hi>Exod.</hi> 1.12.) while they were under the oppreſſion of the <hi>Egyptians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, This Expreſſion, <hi>The Lord bleſſed,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dei benedicere idem eſt quod benefacere. Beatum non fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit hominem ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſi qui fecit ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minem. <hi>Auguſt.</hi> Epiſt. <hi>52</hi> ad <hi>Macedon.</hi>
                     </note> imports a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful effect following it. <hi>The Lord bleſſed the latter end of Job;</hi> that is, he made his latter end very bleſſed. As the Lords ſaying is doing, as his word is operative, and will work; ſo the Lords bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing or well-ſaying, is well-doing; his ſaying is doing, whether for good or hurt. Man bleſſeth man by wiſhing or praying for a bleſſing upon him, or that God would do him good: Man bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
<pb n="978" facs="tcp:48669:504"/> God, when he praiſeth him for his goodneſs, and for the good which he hath done, either to himſelf or others: But when God bleſſeth man, he doth more than wiſh, he makes him bleſſed. Man bleſſeth man miniſterially; God bleſſeth man effectually, as he alſo did the ſeventh day (<hi>Gen.</hi> 2.3.) And therefore the Lord is ſaid to <hi>command the bleſſing</hi> (Levit. 25.21.) eſpecially in <hi>Sion, even life for evermore</hi> (Pſal. 133.5.) Nor was it leſs than a command, by which <hi>The Lord bleſſed the latter end of Job more than his beginning.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence Note;
<q>The good word or bleſſing of God, is enough to procure the good of man.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Every word of God hath its effect; he ſpeaks no vain words: his Word going out of the mouths of his Miniſters, <hi>returns not to him void, but accompliſheth that which he pleaſeth, and proſpers in the thing whereunto he ſends it</hi> (Iſa. 55.11.) that is, either for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction or converſion of thoſe that hear it. Surely then, the word of bleſſing going out of his own mouth, ſhall not return to him void, or without effect. <hi>David</hi> ſpake thus of, or to God (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.16.) <hi>Thou openeſt thine hand, and ſatisfieſt the deſire of every living thing.</hi> When the Lord opens his hand, he alſo opens his heart: and when his heart and hand open, his mouth opens too; that is, he gives forth a word of bleſsing, and he gives it forth to ſatisfaction, <hi>Thou ſatisfieſt every living thing.</hi> And again (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.28.) <hi>Thou openeſt thine hand, they are filled with good. They,</hi> that is, whatſoever lives upon the earth or in the Sea, <hi>wait upon thee</hi> (as it is ſaid, <hi>verſ.</hi> 27.) <hi>that thou maiſt give them their meat in due ſeaſon; that thou giveſt them, they gather; thou openeſt thy hand, they are filled with good.</hi> The hand of God is full of good, and his bleſsing fills all with good, out of his hand.</p>
                  <p>This may comfort the godly in their loweſt condition. What was it that raiſed <hi>Job</hi> from poverty to riches, from weaknes to ſtrength, from the dunghil to the throne? Only this, <hi>The Lord bleſſed him.</hi> Though all be loſt, his word of bleſsing will reſtore all again. If eſtate be loſt, his bleſsing will make us rich; if health be loſt, his bleſsing will make us well; if ſtrength be loſt, his bleſsing will renew it; if credit be loſt, his bleſsing will repair it, and get us honour for diſgrace or reproach. The bleſsing of the Lord is eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="979" facs="tcp:48669:504"/> good thing to us, and doth every good thing for us. As it is dreadful to ſtand under the droppings of a curſe; to be curſed is every evil: ſo happy are they who ſtand under the ſweet influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of a promiſe; to be bleſſed is every good. And if God bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth us, the matter is not much, who curſeth or wiſheth ill to us. The curſe cauſeleſs ſhall not come, nor can any curſe come where God hath bleſſed.</p>
                  <p>But ſome may enquire, who are they that the Lord will bleſs? To be bleſſed, is not every mans portion. A man may be rich, yet not bleſſed; great, yet not bleſſed; healthful, yet not bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: A man may have many bleſsings, for the matter, yet not be bleſſed. This then is a material queſtion, <hi>Who are they that may expect a bleſsing from God upon their ſouls, upon their bodies, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their eſtates, upon their families, upon their all?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, Firſt, In general; They that are in a ſtate of grace, they that are in the Covenant, or as the Apoſtle calls them (<hi>Heb</hi> 6.17.) <hi>Heirs of promiſe:</hi> Theſe are the bleſſed of the Lord; and theſe, both great and ſmall, the Lord will bleſs (<hi>Eph.</hi> 1.3.) <hi>Bleſſed be God, who hath bleſſed us with all ſpiritual bleſsings in heavenly things in Chriſt.</hi> Being in Chriſt, we are in Covenant; and being there, we cannot miſs being bleſſed with all ſpiritual bleſsings, and with whatever is a needful bleſsing, in outward things to: He that bleſſeth in the greater, will not with-hold his bleſsing in the leſs, according to our need.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As they are the general ſubjects of the bleſſing, who are in the Covenant of grace, or in Chriſt, ſo are they more ſpecially, who act graciouſly, and walk as they have received Chriſt; for a perſon that is in a ſtate of grace, may hinder the bleſſing from flowing down upon his ſoul, upon his body, upon his eſtate, upon any thing, upon every thing he hath and doth, by acting ſinfully, and walking unevenly. <hi>David</hi> put the queſtion (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 24.3.) <hi>Who ſhall aſcend into the hill of the Lord?</hi> &amp;c. and anſwered it (<hi>verſ.</hi> 4, 5.) <hi>He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart, who hath not lift up his ſoul to vanity, nor ſworn deceitfully; he ſhall receive the bleſſing from the Lord, and righteouſneſs</hi> (that is, a righteous reward, or a reward according to righteouſneſs) <hi>from the God of his ſalvation. Solomon</hi> aſſerts the preſent performance of what is only promiſed in this <hi>Pſalm;</hi> he ſaith not, The juſt ſhall receive the bleſſing, but they have actually received it (<hi>Prov.</hi>
                     <pb n="980" facs="tcp:48669:505"/> 10.6.) <hi>Bleſſings are upon the head of the juſt.</hi> By the juſt man we may underſtand; Firſt, him that is in a juſtified ſtate, or him that is juſt by faith; Secondly, him that walks in a juſt way, or that do juſtly: And they who are indeed juſtified, are not only engaged by that high act of grace to do juſtly, but are either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly kept in doing ſo, or are ſoon brought to ſee they have not done ſo, and to repentance for it. Juſt and upright men, in theſe two notions, are ſo much bleſſed, that they are a bleſſing (<hi>Prov.</hi> 11.11.) <hi>By the bleſſing of the upright, is the City exalted.</hi> As an upright man wiſheth and prayeth for a bleſſing upon the City where he liveth, ſo he is a bleſſing to it, and that no ſmall one, but to the greatning, enriching, and exaltation of it. He that is good in his perſon, becomes a common good to Cities, yea, to whole Nations; ſuch are a bleſſing, becauſe they receive ſo many bleſſings (<hi>Pro.</hi> 28.20.) <hi>A faithful man ſhall abound with bleſſings.</hi> This faithful man is one that acts and doth all things faithfully, as appears by his oppoſition (in the ſame verſe) to him <hi>that maketh haſt to be rich,</hi> of whom the Text ſaith, <hi>he ſhall not be innocent;</hi> that is, he muſt needs deal unfaithfully or unrighteouſly; for in making ſuch poſt-haſt to riches, he uſually rides (as we ſay) over hedge and ditch, and cannot keep the plain way of honeſty.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, As they who are in a ſtate of grace, and they who act graciouſly in that ſtate, ſo they who worſhip holily, or holy worſhippers, have a ſpecial promiſe of the bleſſing. As <hi>Sion</hi> is the ſeat of holy worſhip, ſo there the Lord commandeth the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing upon holy worſhippers (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 133.3.) And again (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 115.12, 13.) <hi>He will bleſs the houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>he will bleſs the houſe of</hi> Aaron, <hi>he will bleſs them that fear the Lord, both ſmall and great;</hi> that is, the generality of holy worſhippers ſhall be bleſſed. The fear of the Lord is often put in Scripture, for the worſhip of the Lord; and ſo they that fear him, are the ſame with them that worſhip him.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, They are the bleſſed of the Lord, who truſt the Lord for all, and ſo make him the all of their truſt (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.8.) <hi>O taſt and ſee that the Lord is gracious; bleſſed is the man that truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ith in him;</hi> that is, in him only or alone, being convinced of the utter inſufficiency of the creature. That man is <hi>curſed, who truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in man, and maketh fleſh his arm (Jer.</hi> 17.5.) therefore, pure truſt in God hath the bleſſing.</p>
                  <pb n="981" facs="tcp:48669:505"/>
                  <p>Fifthly, They that are a bleſſing unto others, ſhall have <hi>the bleſſing</hi> from the Lord. What it is to be a bleſſing to others, read at large in the 29th Chapter of this Book (<hi>verſ.</hi> 11.) and in 31. Chapter (<hi>verſ.</hi> 20.) They that do good to others, they eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially who do good to the ſouls of others, are a bleſſing to others. Now, they who do good, they ſhall receive good themſelves (<hi>Prov.</hi> 11.25.) <hi>The liberal ſhall be made fat, and he that water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, ſhall be watered alſo himſelf.</hi> He that <hi>watereth</hi> is a common good, a bleſſing to the place where he lives, a bleſsing to the rich, a bleſsing to the poor, a bleſsing to relations, a bleſsing to ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; upon ſuch, the Scripture aſſures the bleſsing of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, They who promote the worſhip and ſervice of God, they that are friends to the Ark of God, ſhall be bleſſed (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.11.) <hi>The Lord bleſſed the houſe of</hi> Obed-edom, <hi>becauſe he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained the Ark,</hi> ſhewed kindneſs to the Ark, and was ready to do any ſervice for the Ark of God; he will be a friend to the true friends of his Church.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, They ſhall receive a bleſsing of God, who ſtrive in prayer for his bleſsing. <hi>Jacob</hi> was bleſſed; but he w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eſtled for it. They that would have it, muſt ask it with a gracious impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity; they that ſeek it diligently, ſhall find it.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the chief characters of the perſons whom the Lord will bleſs. And ſeeing his bleſsing is ſo effectual for the procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our good, we ſhould above all things labour to procure his bleſsing. When <hi>Jacob</hi> wreſtled with the Angel, he asked no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of him but a bleſsing (<hi>Gen.</hi> 32.26.) He did not ſay, <hi>I will not let thee go,</hi> except thou deliver me from my brother <hi>Eſau;</hi> he did not ſay, <hi>I will not let thee go,</hi> unleſs thou make me rich, or great; he only ſaid, <hi>I will not let thee go, except thou bleſs me;</hi> let me be bleſſed, and let me be what thou wilt, or I can be. What ſhould we deſire in compariſon of the bleſsing of God, ſeeing his bleſsing (ſtrictly taken) is the fruit of his fatherly love! A man may be rich, and great, and honoured among men, yet not beloved; but he that is indeed bleſſed, is certainly beloved of God. <hi>Eſau</hi> could not obtain the bleſſing: Now what ſaith the Lord by the Prophet of him, as the Apoſtle quotes the Prophet? (<hi>Rom.</hi> 9.13.) <hi>Eſau have I hated. Eſau</hi> got much riches, but he could not get the bleſsing, for he was hated of the Lord; and
<pb n="982" facs="tcp:48669:506"/> therefore it is ſaid (<hi>Heb.</hi> 12.17.) <hi>He found no place for repentance, though he ſought it carefully with tears;</hi> that is, he could not make <hi>Iſaac</hi> repent of bleſsing <hi>Jacob</hi> (though through a miſtake, yet) according to Gods appointment; he could not prevail with him, no, not by tears, to take off the bleſsing from his brother <hi>Jacob,</hi> and place it upon himſelf: And the reaſon why the bleſsing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained with <hi>Jacob,</hi> was, becauſe he was loved of God. <hi>The bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing muſt go, where the love goes.</hi> The loved of the Lord, are and ſhall be bleſſed; and they who are bleſſed, have all good with a bleſsing. (Read, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24.35. <hi>Gen.</hi> 26.13. <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.3. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.11. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107.38.) Yea, as God giveth all good with a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, ſo he giveth himſelf, who is the chief good, beſt of all, and bleſſed for evermore, to thoſe whom he bleſſeth.</p>
                  <p>Then how ſhould we deſire the bleſsing of God, or to be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by God? It is wonderful, how paſsionately, and even im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiently, the Votaries of <hi>Rome</hi> deſire the Popes bleſsing; they think themſelves made men, if they can but have his bleſsing. I have read of a Cardinal, who ſeeing the people ſo ſtrangely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of his bleſsing,<note place="margin">Quando quidem populus hic vult decipi, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipiatur.</note> ſaid, <hi>Seeing this people will be deceived, let them be deceived.</hi> But we cannot be too deſirous of a bleſsing from the Lord; if we have a bleſsing from him, and he bleſs us, we cannot be deceived; we can never miſs of comfort, if he bleſs us.</p>
                  <p>But whence is it then, that ſome look ſo much after creature-helps, not minding the bleſsing of God? Doubtleſs it ſlows or ſprings from one of theſe three bad fountains or bitter roots.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, From ignorance; they know not what the bleſsing of God means; for, as Chriſt told the woman of <hi>Samaria (Acts</hi> 4.10.) <hi>If thou kneweſt the gift of God, thou wouldſt have asked,</hi> &amp;c. So, did they know what it is to be bleſſed of God, they would ask it above all things. It proceeds,</p>
                  <p>Secondly, From a ſpirit of profaneneſs in many; they deſpiſe God in their hearts, and think it below them to call for his help or bleſsing. Of ſuch <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 14.6.) <hi>Ye have ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the counſel of the poor, becauſe the Lord is his refuge;</hi> or, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ('tis all one in effect) he lives upon the bleſsing of God, you are aſhamed of this; this is poor counſel, think you, as it is the counſel of the poor; this truſting in God, this making God our
<pb n="983" facs="tcp:48669:506"/> refuge, this living upon the bleſsing of God, is a pitiful life, ſay you. <hi>The wicked through the pride of his countenance, will not ſeek after God, God is not in all his thoughts,</hi> or not at all in his thoughts, to ſeek unto him, and depend wholly upon him (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.4.) As <hi>Ezra was aſhamed to require of the King a band of ſoldiers and horſemen, to help them againſt the enemy in the way, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had ſpoken unto the King, ſaying, the hand of our God is upon all them for good, that ſeek him,</hi> &amp;c. (<hi>Ezra</hi> 8.22.) So, prophane perſons are aſhamed to ask help of God, and his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing at any time, but then eſpecially, when they have bands of ſoldiers and horſemen to help them, as will appear further in the next thing. For,</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, This mindleſsneſs and regardleſsneſs of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God proceeds in ſome, from confidence in an arm of fleſh, either their own or others. The Prophet reproved the <hi>Jews</hi> for this in the day of their trouble (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 22.8, 9, 10, 11.) <hi>And he</hi> (that is, God) <hi>diſcovered the covering of Judah</hi> (that is, what <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> covered himſelf with, or thought himſelf ſafely ſheltered by from all danger; what was that? the next words tell us) <hi>thou didſt look in that day to the armour of the houſe of the Forreſt; ye have ſeen alſo the breaches of the City of</hi> David, <hi>that they are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, ye have fortified the wall,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but ye have not looked to the maker thereof, neither had reſpect unto him that faſhioned it long ago.</hi> The meaning of all is this; ye relyed upon, and put confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in your own ſtrength, but looked not after, nor ſought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me for my bleſsing; ye thought ye ſhould do well enough, if your magazines were well ſtored, and your City well fortified, and therefore neglected me. The ſame Prophet (Chap. 31.1.) ſhews the ſame reaſon why they neglected God, <hi>why they looked not to the holy One of Iſrael, nor ſought the Lord;</hi> it was, becauſe <hi>they went down to</hi> Egypt <hi>for help, and ſtayed on horſes, and truſted in charets, becauſe they were many, and in horſemen, becauſe they were very ſtrong.</hi> We cannot truſt in God, and creatures too. If God alone be not truſted to, he is not at all truſted; and they who put their truſt in any creature, withdraw it from God, and make that creature their God. They cannot ſo much as mind, much leſs ſeek a bleſſing from the true God, who chuſe to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves another God.</p>
                  <pb n="984" facs="tcp:48669:507"/>
                  <p>Again, ſeeing the Lords bleſsing is effectual, then whatever our ſucceſſes and increaſes are, let us aſcribe all to his bleſsing. Do not ſacrifice to your own nets, nor burn incenſe to your own drags, but ſay, this hath God wrought, the bleſsing of the Lord hath brought it to paſs. As the Apoſtle ſpake about ſpirituals (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6.) <hi>I have planted,</hi> Apollo <hi>watered, but God gave the increaſe;</hi> ſo 'tis in temporals, all our encreaſings are of God: Therefore let us ſay with the <hi>Pſalmiſt, Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but to thy Name be the praiſe.</hi> Do not thank your wit for riches, nor your induſtry for increaſe, nor your ſtrength for victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, not any humane help for any of your attainments: <hi>The race is not to the ſwift, nor the battel to the ſtrong, neither yet bread to the wiſe, nor yet riches to men of underſtanding,</hi> &amp;c. (<hi>Ecrl.</hi> 9.11.) All is of God, it is his bleſsing upon the means, which makes the means ſucceſsful.</p>
                  <p>But ſome may ſay, are all men to aſcribe all their ſucceſſes and increaſes to the bleſsing of God?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, Negatively; All encreaſes and outward ſucceſſes are not to be aſcribed unto, nor fathered upon God. A man may encreaſe in riches, and double his eſtate, as <hi>Jobs</hi> was, yet not by the bleſsing of God: Only that comes by a bleſsing from God, which is got in Gods way, or by good means, according to the characters before hinted of the perſons whom the Lord will bleſs; for they who either make a profeſsion of diſhoneſty, or are diſhoneſt in their profeſsion, let them take heed of pinning their ſucceſſes upon God, and of thanking him for them. Many ſay in their hearts, and ſome are not aſhamed to ſay it with their mouths, <hi>Honeſt dealers muſt die beggars. They never came by riches in the way of a bleſſing, who ſay honeſty is the way to poverty;</hi> much leſs, they whoſe conſciences know and tell them (though o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers know it not, and ſo cannot tell them) that they have enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves by the wrong, or raiſed themſelves by the ruin of others.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Job</hi> was enriched and raiſed high, and the Text aſſures us what enriched him, what raiſed him; <hi>The Lord bleſſed</hi>

God bleſſed, and greatly bleſſed the former part of <hi>Jobs</hi> life, for <hi>he was the greatest man of all men in the Eaſt;</hi> but now <hi>Job</hi> ſhall be greater than <hi>Job,</hi> he ſhall be greater than himſelf. His affliction ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed down his houſe, and all he had, to the very foundation; but when God would hold the plummet in his hand, and rebuild him, to what an amazing height did his houſe ariſe! <hi>The Lord bleſſed his latter end, more than his beginning.</hi> The words are plain, and need no comment. From them we may obſerve,
<q>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> The latter part of a good mans life, is the best part of his life.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is often ſo, I do not ſay, it is alwayes ſo, in outward things, God deals not with all alike; but it is often ſo, God gives them their beſt at laſt, even in the things of this life. As the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Feaſt ſaid to the Bridegroom (<hi>John</hi> 2.) <hi>Thou haſt kept the beſt wine till now.</hi> So the Lord often keeps the beſt wine of outward comforts, to the very laſt of our lives. <hi>Bildad</hi> put it only as a ſuppoſition to <hi>Job</hi> (Chap. 8.7.) <hi>If thou wert pure and upright, ſurely then he would awake for thee, and make the habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thy righteouſneſs proſperous; though thy beginning was ſmall, yet thy latter end ſhould greatly increaſe.</hi> But we may reſolve it as a Poſition concerning <hi>Job;</hi> ſurely he was pure and upright, for God did awake for him, and made the habitation of his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs proſperous; his beginning was (comparatively) ſmall, but his latter end did greatly encreaſe, or he had a great encreaſe at his latter end. And though this be not alwayes true, as to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things, that the Lord bleſſeth the latter end of a good man more than his beginning; yet it is always true, as to ſpiritual things, it is always true, as to the beſt things. The Lord gives his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple their beſt ſoul-bleſsings at laſt; though they have great good before, yet greater good, or their good in a greater meaſure then; he gives them more grace, more of his Spirit, more of his
<pb n="986" facs="tcp:48669:508"/> comforts, and their latter end is moſt bleſſed, as it is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of endleſs bleſſedneſs. <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaid to the rich man in the Parable, <hi>Son, remember thou haſt had thy good things, and</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus <hi>evil things; but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.</hi> The Lord deals beſt with all his people at laſt, one way or other; to be ſure, all ſhall be well with them in the latter end. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith (<hi>Eccl.</hi> 7.8.) <hi>Better is the end of a thing, than the beginning.</hi> And he ſaid ſo, not becauſe all things end better than they begin; but becauſe when things or perſons end well, it is then ſurely well with them, whatever their beginning was. <hi>That is well, which ends well.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence, let us be minded not to judge the work of God before the latter end. The works of God ſeem croſs many times to his people; but he will ſet all right, and make them amends for all at the latter end. The Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> calls us to conſider <hi>Job's</hi> latter end (Chap. 5.11.) <hi>Ye have heard of the patience of Job</hi> (that is, you have heard of his ſufferings in the fleſh, and of his ſuffering ſpirit) <hi>and ye have ſeen the end of the Lord;</hi> that is, what end the Lord made for him. Some give another interpretation of theſe latter words (as was ſhewed formerly) but this I conceive moſt clear to the context, <hi>Ye have ſeen the end of the Lord,</hi> that is, what end the Lord made for <hi>Job:</hi> Though the middle part of his life was very grievous, yet God changed the Scene of things, and his end was very glorious. <hi>David (Pſal.</hi> 37.37.) would have the end of upright men marked and well conſidered; <hi>Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright, the end of that man is peace.</hi> Poſsibly he hath had a great deal of trouble in his way, but his end is peace. Let not us be offended at the croſſes which we meet with in the courſe of our lives, but look to the promiſed crown at the concluſion of our lives. Let us not ſtay in the death of Chriſt, nor in the grave of Chriſt, but look to the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and the aſcenſion of Chriſt. You may ſee thoſe who are Chriſts on the Croſs, and in the Grave, but mark and you ſhall ſee their reſurrection and aſcenſion. The two witneſſes are repreſented ſlain, yet raiſed, and then aſcending up to heaven in a cloud, their enemies beholding them (<hi>Rev.</hi> 11.11, 12.) <hi>Deſpiſe not the day of ſmall things (Zech.</hi> 4.10.) the latter end may have a great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe; deſpond not in the day of ſorrowful things, for the latter end may be full of joy. There are three things which ſhould much comfort us in our afflictions.</p>
                  <pb n="987" facs="tcp:48669:508"/>
                  <p>Firſt, That they cannot laſt alwayes, they will have an end.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That while they laſt, or before theyh ave an end, they are medicinal and healthful, they are for our good while they continue upon us, or we in them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, (which we have in the Text) we may expect, that as they ſhall ſurely have an end, ſo that they will end comfortably. <hi>No chaſtning for the preſent</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.11.) <hi>ſeemeth joyous, but grievous; nevertheleſs, afterwards it yieldeth the peaceable fruits of righteouſneſs, unto them which are exerciſed thereby.</hi> God will not only bring our troubles to an end, but he will give us ſweet fruit at the end of them, as a recompence for all our troubles. God will not only bring our ſufferings to an end, but to ſuch an end as will make us gainers by them. Thoſe are even deſirable and lovely loſſes, which iſſue in ſuch advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, In that the Lord gave <hi>Job</hi> ſo great an advance in worldly things,</p>
                  <p>Obſerve;
<q>The Lord ſometimes gives his people much more of this world, than they deſire, or ever looked after.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Job</hi> was far from praying for ſuch an encreaſe, he never deſired that his earthly ſubſtance ſhould be doubled in his latter end: Indeed, we find him once wiſhing that it were with him as in his beginning, but he wiſhed not for more (Chap. 29.2.) <hi>O that it were with me as in the months past, as in the day when the Lord preſerved me, when his candle ſhined upon my head, and by his light I walked through darkneſs. Job</hi> wiſhed that he were in as good a condition as he once had, but he never wiſhed that all might be doubled, or that his latter end ſhould be more than his begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; yet the Lord gave him more, gave him double to his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, God exceeded his prayers and his wiſhes. As the Lord <hi>is able to do exceeding abundantly for us, above all that we ask or think (Eph.</hi> 3.20.) ſo he often doth; and uſually, therefore, moderates the deſires and askings of his people, as to the things of this world, that he may out-give their askings, and out-do their deſires.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Lord made <hi>Job</hi> the greateſt man in the Eaſt in
<pb n="988" facs="tcp:48669:509"/> his beginning, but he bleſſed his latter end more than his begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>How much ſoever the Lord gives at one time, he can give more at another.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>God gave <hi>Job</hi> good meaſure before, but now according to that expreſſion (<hi>Luke</hi> 6.38.) he gave <hi>him good meaſure, heaped up, preſſed down, and running over.</hi> Let us not ſay, when God hath given us much, or done much for us, he can give or do no more for us: he hath more in his treaſure of temporal good things, and he hath more in his treaſure of ſpiritual good things, than he hath yet given out to any; he can give more faith, how much faith ſoever he hath given; he can give more patience, how much patience ſoever he hath given, and ſo of every grace and good thing. The Lords ſtock and treaſure can never be drawn dry; he is an ever-over-flowing fountain. If you had much at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, you may have much more at the latter end. So much of theſe words, as they hold out the reſtoring of <hi>Jobs</hi> eſtate in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral; the particulars are ſumm'd up in the cloſe of the verſe:
<q>For he had fourteen thouſand Sheep, and ſix thouſand Camels, and a thouſand yoke of Oxen, and a thouſand She-Aſſes.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The encreaſe of his eſtate is here ſet forth in cattel only, as his firſt eſtate was (cattel were the riches of thoſe times and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys) yet doubtleſs his eſtate encreaſed in every thing or kind. Firſt, his family and ſervants encreaſed, to look to ſo many cattel. Secondly, his Lands and paſtures encreaſed to feed them. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, his houſe and buildings encreaſed, to receive and lodge ſo nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous a Family. Fourthly, his honour and dignity increaſed. Some affirm, that whereas before, he had only ſome ſmall prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality under his government, now he was declared King over all the Land of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>z.</hi> Thus all ſorts of good things were given him double; but whether at once, or by degrees, is not expreſt.</p>
                  <p>Some of the Rabbins have a fancy, and it is a wild one, that <hi>Jobs</hi> cattel which were taken from him, were not carried quite away, but only driven into ſome other Country, and there kept; ſo that when he was reſtored, they were brought home to him again, with this double encreaſe. This may well go for a fancy;
<pb n="989" facs="tcp:48669:509"/> for, not his own cattel, but cattel of the ſame kind, were reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to him double. There is no difficulty in theſe words. The Lord bleſſed the latter end of <hi>Job</hi> more than his beginning, giving double or twice as many Sheep, Oxen, Camels, Aſſes, as he had before.</p>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>Outward good things, Sheep and Oxen, Houſes and Lands, Gold and Silver, are a bleſſing, as they come from God unto his ſervants.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here is nothing ſaid of the beſt things; all was but Sheep and Oxen, yet in theſe <hi>Job</hi> received a bleſsing. The Lord (<hi>Deut.</hi> 28.4.) made large promiſes of bleſsings to his obeying people, or to his people in caſe of obedience, and all in outward comforts; <hi>Bleſſed ſhalt thou be in the City, and bleſſed ſhalt thou be in the field; bleſſed ſhall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy ground, and the fruit of thy cattel, the encreaſe of thy kine, and the flocks of thy ſheep; bleſſed ſhall be thy basket, and thy ſtore.</hi> Spiritual things are the beſt bleſsings; ſpiritual things are not only the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt, but the moſt neceſſary bleſsings. The favour of God, the light of his countenance, pardon of ſin, grace in our hearts; theſe are excellent bleſsings, and theſe make us exceedingly bleſſed; and no doubt but <hi>Job</hi> did chiefly look after theſe bleſsings; this good man deſired the light of Gods countenance, the ſhinings of his face upon him, the workings of his grace and ſpirit in him, the evidences of his love to him, infinitely above cattel, corn and wine. A godly man accounts himſelf but in a poor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, if he were to reckon all his eſtate in Houſes and Lands, in Sheep and Oxen; yet theſe are a bleſsing from the Lord upon him, and ſo he accounts them. And ſtill it muſt be remembred, which hath already been touched, that before the coming of Chriſt, before there was a full diſcovery, and a clear manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the grace of God in Chriſt to his people, they in thoſe times were much led and fed with promiſes of temporal bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings. The faithful were allured to heaven by earthly things. Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt (who came down from heaven to lift us up thither, who took our nature, that we might partake of the divine nature, who was cloathed with our fleſh, to ſhew that God dwelleth in us, and hath joyned us to his glory and immortality; Jeſus Chriſt, I
<pb n="990" facs="tcp:48669:510"/> ſay) was known only in ſhadows and remote propheſies, in thoſe times, and therefore it was neceſſary the Lord ſhould deal with them accordingly, and allure them by promiſes of cattel, and corn, and children, eſpecially by the promiſe of long life (which hath the greateſt reſemblance to, and bears the faireſt image of eternal life) and all becauſe the heavenly life was not then ſo perfectly diſcovered, as it is now in theſe Goſpel-times. For though it be a truth, that all the good things of the world are not ſufficient to make a love-token, yet God gives thoſe good things to his people as tokens of his love, and they ſee love in them; and theſe leſſer good things are then beſt to us, when we can look on them as bleſsings coming from the love of God, which we may do,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, When we can ſay we have got and keep them with a good conſcience.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, When we uſe and order them with prudence.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, When we diſpence them charitably and freely, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the needs and neceſsities of others. When we truly and intentionally honour God with our ſubſtance, in doing acts of love, it ſhews that he hath given it us in love.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, When the Lord with encreaſe of riches, gives us an encreaſe of grace, when our ſouls thrive as well as our eſtates, then we may look upon riches as coming to us in love. Sheep and Oxen, Gold and Silver, without a juſt, and wiſe, and gracious poſſeſsing and uſing of them, prove curſes at laſt, not bleſsings, ſnares, not favours. There are none ſo unhappy as fooliſh rich men, none ſo baſe as covetous rich men, none ſo intollerable as proud rich men, none ſo vile and deſpicable as ſluggiſh voluptuous rich men, none more ungodly and irreligious, than they who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving riches, truſt in them, and dote upon them; only when the Lord gives ſpiritual things with temporal, grace with goods, they are mercies to us. When <hi>Luther</hi> received a favour from a great Prince, he began to be afraid that God would put him off with ſuch things. A godly man receives a portion in earthly good things, but he will not take all the good things of the earth for his por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Now, as all ſpiritual things are better than temporal, ſo among temporals, ſome are better than others. <hi>Job</hi> received good things when his cattel were doubled, but he had better bleſsings of this
<pb n="991" facs="tcp:48669:510"/> life reſtored to him than thoſe; his eſtate reſtored double in cattle was nothing to his children reſtored ſingle, as it follows in the next words.</p>
                  <q>
                     <bibl>
                        <hi>Verſ. 13.</hi>
                     </bibl> He had alſo ſeven ſons, and three daughters.</q>
                  <p>This is the third part of <hi>Jobs</hi> reſtauration <hi>ſons and daughters.</hi> We may conſider this bleſſing, Firſt, In the number, Secondly, In the ſex. In number, his children were ſeven and three. As to ſex, they were both ſons and daughters; he had ſeven ſons and three daughters, in all ten, juſt the number he had before, as we read at the ſecond verſe of the firſt chapter.</p>
                  <p>Some of the Jewiſh Rabbies (before ſpoken of) ſay, his former children were not indeed ſlain, but removed during the time of his affliction, and that, being ended, were reſtored the ſame both in number and perſon. This is as groundleſs a dream as the other about his cattle, and ſo I leave it. For,</p>
                  <p>That his children were really ſlain with the fall of the houſe where they were feaſting, the hiſtory makes evident in the firſt chapter; and that he had the ſame number of children (not the ſame children) reſtored, is all that is evident in this.</p>
                  <p>Only here a queſtion ariſeth, and ſome trouble themſelves much about it, to little purpoſe, how to make good that of the 8th ver. where 'tis ſaid, <hi>The Lord gave</hi> Job <hi>twice as much as he had before,</hi> whenas he had but juſt ſo many ſons and daughters as he had before. Here is no doubling of them, and it may be thought, that the Lord, being now bleſſing his latter end more than his beginning, ſhould have given him more children, double children, becauſe the more children the greater is the bleſſing.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, Firſt, Negatively. The reaſon why his children were not double, though his cattle were, was not, Firſt, Out of any want of power in God, he could have doubled his children as well as his cattle. Nor was it, Secondly, For want of love or good will to <hi>Job:</hi> Nor was it, Thirdly, (As,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Tertul.</hi> lib. de patientia. c. <hi>14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi>
                     </note> one of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, <hi>Tertullian,</hi> gives the reaſon) that <hi>Job</hi> might never want ſomething to exerciſe his patience with while he lived, foraſmuch as he ſaw himſelf ſhortned in that mercy. Nor was it, Fourthly, (As <hi>Aquinas</hi> conceived) becauſe, if his children had been doubled as well as his eſtate, then his children would not have
<pb n="992" facs="tcp:48669:511"/> had a double eſtate, nor more than they ſhould have had before. Forty proportionably divided among twenty, yields each of them no greater a portion, than twenty will do to ten. Nor was it, Fifthly, Becauſe the Lord would not have him over-burdened with cares about their education; none of theſe were any reaſon, why <hi>Jobs</hi> children were not doubled to him in number, as well as his cattle. And therefore,</p>
                  <p>I anſwer affirmatively,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, For the word <hi>double, or twice as much,</hi> in the Text, which this ſeems not to come up unto, we may eaſily ſalve that difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for the Text ſpeaks not of perſons, but of things, or of his ſubſtance, with reſpect to <hi>doubling</hi> or a <hi>twice as much.</hi> As for his children they come in with an <hi>alſo,</hi> as an additional bleſſing to all the reſt; <hi>He had alſo ſeven ſons, and three daughters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Thoſe words <hi>twice as much,</hi> need not be taken ſtrictly, as was ſhewed before; <hi>Job</hi> might, and doubtleſs did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a double mercy in his children, though their perſons were not doubled nor multiplied, as will appear further afterwards.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I anſwer, it was the pleaſure of the Lord; to give him no more than the ſame number of children, and that may ſuffice us.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Some of the Ancients are much pleaſed with this other anſwer, ſaying, <hi>Job,</hi> in a ſence, had his children doubled; for his ſlain children were not loſt, but gone before, and lived ſtill in a bleſſed ſtate: They having immortal ſouls, and being the ſeed of the righteous, their father had reaſon to believe them ſafe in <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome. <hi>Thoſe children are not loſt to their parents when they dye,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tibi non perit qui Deo non perit. Non numero ſed valore, quod occultè inſinuatur in filicabus, quae pulcherrimae fuiſſe leguntur. <hi>Aquin.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>who are not loſt to God, or are not themſelves loſt children.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Though <hi>Jobs</hi> children were not doubled in number as his cattle were, yet we may judge them doubled to him in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and vertuous qualities. The beauty of his daughters is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely noted in the following words: And ſhall we think that God, who had a bleſſing for <hi>Job,</hi> bleſſed his children only with fading bodily beauty? doubtleſs, their minds were more richly indowed, and their ſouls more beautiful than their bodies. And if <hi>Jobs</hi> daughters were ſuch, we may well conceive his Sons were not inferiour to them in gracious qualifications, and that they much exceeded the ſons he had before his affliction. Some have
<pb n="993" facs="tcp:48669:511"/> ſpoken doubtfully, at leaſt, of <hi>Jobs</hi> former children, as if (though good, yet) not very good; and they give two reaſons for it out of this book. Firſt, Becauſe, when they went to feaſt at each others houſes <hi>Job</hi> uſed to offer ſacrifice, fea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ing his children had curſed God in their hearts. Secondly, <hi>Bildad</hi> (chap. 8.4.) ſeems to lay a blot upon his former children, <hi>If thy children</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>have ſinned againſt him, and he have caſt them away for their tranſgreſſion,</hi> &amp;c. which may intimate the ſinful miſcarriages of his former children in the courſe of their lives, as well as that dreadful accident by which they dyed. Yet, I conceive, we need not caſt any ſuch blot upon them; they might be good, though theſe were better, and ſo a double mercy to their father. <hi>He had alſo ſeven ſons, and three daughters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>Children are great bleſſings.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>When the Lord told <hi>Abraham</hi> (Gen. 15.2) <hi>I am thy ſhield, and exceeding great reward,</hi> Abraham ſaid, <hi>Lord what wilt thou give me, ſeing I go childleſs?</hi> As if he had ſaid, what is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance without an heir? Children are a bleſſing which God many times denieth his own children: God denied <hi>Abraham</hi> that bleſſing long, yet gave it him at laſt. <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſervant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting the bleſſings of God beſtowed upon his maſter, put this as chief (<hi>Gen.</hi> 24.35.) <hi>The Lord hath bleſſed my maſter great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he is become great, he hath given him flocks and herds, ſilver and gold, men ſervants and maid ſervants</hi> (what follows?) <hi>and</hi> Sarah <hi>my maſters wife, bare a ſon to my maſter, when ſhe was old. Abrahams</hi> ſervant counted this the complement of all his maſters outward bleſſings, that as the Lord had given him a great eſtate, ſo a ſon to inherit and poſſeſs it after him. And if children be a bleſſing? let all who have them take heed of looking upon them as a burthen.</p>
                  <p>And ſeing they are a bleſſing of the Lord, ſeing they come from him, let all who have them be admoniſhed to bring them up for him, or, as the Apoſtle directs, <hi>In the nurture and admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lord.</hi> Whatever we receive from God we ſhould uſe for him, and return to him; our eſtates ſhould be ſerviceable to the Lord, and above all we ſhould labour to make our children ſerviceable to him.</p>
                  <pb n="994" facs="tcp:48669:512"/>
                  <p>Thus we have ſeen the three parts of <hi>Jobs</hi> reſtauration. Firſt, His friends; Secondly, His wealth; Thirdly, His children, were reſtored to him. But <hi>Job</hi> had four loſſes, and we hear nothing about the reſtoring of the fourth. Firſt, He loſt his ſubſtance; Secondly, His children; Thirdly, His health; Fourthly, His friends: Here's a reſtoring of three of them, but nothing is ſpoken of the fourth, which I place third, the <hi>reſtoring of his health.</hi> Now health being the chief of outward bleſſings, better than ſheep and oxen, and whatever we can have in this world, why was not the reſtoring of that mercy mentioned?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, Though the reſtoring of his health and ſtrength be not expreſt verbally, yet it is expreſt equivalently or vertually; for when it is ſaid he offered ſacrifice, when it is ſaid he did eat bread with his friends in his houſe, theſe are proofs of his health; and what was laſt ſpoken, that he had ſo many children, proves it much more. So then, though this fourth part of his mercy, be not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, yet it is implied in all that went before.</p>
                  <p>But, that being granted, 'tis further queried, when his health was reſtored? whether before he prayed for his friends, or in the time of his prayer for his friends? or whether after all was done? Some make hot diſputes about this matter, which ſurely is not much material, if we knew the certainty of it; nor do I know how any ſhould attain the certain kuowledg of it, ſeing the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is utterly ſilent, as to any determination of it.</p>
                  <p>There is one queſtion more. The text ſaith, God gave <hi>Job twice as much</hi> in cattle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but here is nothing ſaid of his twice as much in grace, here is no mention of any amendment in his ſpiritual ſtate; his goods were doubled, but was his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? did <hi>Job</hi> recover only in temporals?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, Firſt, The graces of <hi>Job</hi> were never loſt, as his cattle and children were; and therefore there needed no mention of the reſtoring of his graces. Satan, by the Lords permiſſion, put him to it, and tried all his graces, but could not rob him of one.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Jobs</hi> graces were not only not loſt, but doubled in that exerciſe or combate. True grace encreaſeth by the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry uſe of it, much more by the extraordinary trials of it. And doubtleſs <hi>Job,</hi> who was ſo eminently gracious, increaſed in every grace, while he continued in this fiery trial. He ſaid of himſelf
<pb n="995" facs="tcp:48669:512"/> (<hi>chap.</hi> 23.10.) <hi>When he hath tried me I ſhall come forth as gold.</hi> I ſhall come out better than I came in. He loſt droſs and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in the trial, but no grace, nor any degree of grace; his graces were doubled or increaſed. A believer thrives (as to the inner man) in affliction, how much ſoever he loſeth and goeth backward as a man. As the time of affliction is a ſpecial time for the uſing of grace, ſo for the increaſing of it: Grace never grows more in a gracious heart than in a day of trouble. And though poſſibly a godly man doth not ſenſibly, or to appearance grow in grace preſently, yet he truly doth ſo, and in due time it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that he hath done ſo: We may take this chapter for a proof of it. God himſelf found <hi>Job</hi> much bettered in his graces, elſe he had not uſed him as a mediator for his friends, which was as high a ſpiritual honour as could be put upon him, acceptance being promiſed and given him in that work. Nor would the Lord have uſed that endearing word, <hi>My ſervant, my ſervant</hi> Job, four times in one verſe, had not <hi>Job</hi> improved in his ſervice, which could not be but by the improvement of his graces. God called <hi>Job</hi> ſervant once in the firſt chapter; ſurely he was become a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſervant now that the Lord ſeemed ſo much delighted to call him <hi>ſervant</hi> in this laſt chapter of the book, when he had taken full trial of him by ſuffering, as formerly by doing. We may well conclude, <hi>Job</hi> was become a more humble ſervant, a more profitable ſervant, a more holy ſervant, a more ſpiritual ſervant, than ever he had been, when we find the Lord inſiſting ſo much upon, and ſo often repeating that relation to him, <hi>My ſervant Job.</hi> His ſufferings had mended his ſervice, and his paſſive obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience had fitted him more for active. God was ſo much pleaſed with his ſervice, that he took pleaſure to call him <hi>ſervant.</hi> So then, we may anſwer the querie propoſed; <hi>Jobs</hi> increaſe was not only in cattle (that had been but a poor increaſe) his increaſe was alſo in grace and goodneſs; and he who was a ſervant of the Lord before, was then a more approved ſervant.</p>
                  <p>The Lord having told us, in the cloſe of this verſe, how many ſons and daughters <hi>Job</hi> had, he is pleaſed to give us a character or deſcription of his daughters in the two verſes following.</p>

                  <p>THe former verſe gave us the account of <hi>Jobs</hi> children; He had alſo ſeven ſons and three daughters: Nor is any thing more ſaid of his ſons, but that they were ſeven; but much more is ſaid of his daughters in theſe two verſes, than that they were three; and more is ſpoken of his daughters in three particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>

                  <p>Some have queried, why no more is ſaid of the ſons of <hi>Job,</hi> than how many they were? To ſuch, this anſwer may ſuffice, it was the Lords pleaſure to have no more ſpoken of them; and where no more is ſaid, why ſhould we expect more?</p>
                  <pb n="997" facs="tcp:48669:513"/>
                  <p>If any ſhall further enquire; but were not his ſons worthy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that they are put off thus ſlightly, and mention made only of their number, not of their weight? Were they not worthy to have ſo much as their names recorded? which honour, and much more, is done their ſiſters, the daughters of <hi>Job.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, We may upon good ground believe, that <hi>Jobs</hi> ſeven ſons were worthy perſons, becauſe they were a great part, yea, the chief part of his reſtored happineſs; for as children are better than riches, ſo among children, ſons are better than daughters, as being the more worthy ſex. Sons, if not well qualified, are not only leſs worthy than daughters, but a great croſs to their father: And therefore it would have been a diminiſhing of <hi>Jobs</hi> felicity, to have had ſons equal in number with the former, yet inferior in vertue and man-like qualities; we may, for this reaſon, ſafely conclude, that (though nothing be ſaid of their worth) that <hi>Jobs</hi> ſons were worthy perſons, or perſons of praiſe worthy qualities. But ſeing we have nothing from divine authority, but only from well-grounded reaſon, to aſſert concerning <hi>Jobs</hi> ſons, I ſhall not ſtay the reader in any further diſcourſe about them; but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed as the text doth with the daugtiters, concerning whom we have many things to ſay from divine authority. And, Firſt, Their names muſt not be paſt with ſilence.</p>

                  <p>The Hebrew is <hi>he called the name of one.</hi> Every <hi>firſt is one, but every one is not firſt;</hi> and therefore to diſtinguiſh who this <hi>one</hi> was, we render the word <hi>Firſt.</hi> 'Tis uſual in Scripture to call that <hi>one</hi> which is <hi>Firſt.</hi> Thus ſpake <hi>Moſes,</hi> deſcribing the works of creation (<hi>Gen.</hi> 1.5.) <hi>So the evening and the morning were the first day:</hi> The Hebrew ſtrictly is, <hi>The evening was, and the morning was, day one.</hi> Any day is one day, the fift day was one day, and the ſixt day was one day, as well as the firſt; but the fift

                  <p>There is a two fold firſtneſs. Firſt, In order of time. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, In order of honour. Firſt here is firſt in time. The other two might equal, yea, exceed the firſt in worth and dignity; but this was <hi>Jobs</hi> firſt-born daughter, his firſt in time. <hi>He called the name of the firſt</hi> Jemima.</p>
                  <p>Hence note, Firſt;
<q>It is a duty to give names to our children.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis not meerly matter of prudence, 'tis not humane inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to give names. God himſelf gave the name to the firſt man; God called him by the name, which, doubtleſs himſelf had given him, when he called him <hi>Adam.</hi> The proper name of the firſt man, is a name common to all men; <hi>Adam</hi> ſignifying <hi>red earth,</hi> ſheweth us of what matter all men are made. And as God called the firſt man by that name <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo <hi>Adam</hi> gave a name to the firſt woman, his wife (<hi>Gen.</hi> 3.20.) <hi>He called his wifes name</hi> Eve, <hi>becauſe ſhe was the mother of all living.</hi> And as God gave the firſt man a name, and he named the firſt woman, ſo God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the firſt man to give names to all living creatures (<hi>Gen.</hi> 2.19.) <hi>The Lord brought all the beaſts of the field to</hi> Adam <hi>to ſee what he would call them; &amp; whatſoever</hi> Adam <hi>called every liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing creature, that was the name thereof.</hi> The Lord would have nothing nameleſs, or without a name; ſurely then, he would have men and women known by their names. <hi>Abraham</hi> was once called <hi>Abram, a high father;</hi> but God changed his name, and would have him called <hi>Abraham, the father of a multitude.</hi> Were it not for names we ſhould be in a great confuſion, both about per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and things; we could not diſtinguiſh men had we not names to call them by;<note place="margin">Nomon quaſi notamon. Shem, quaſi Sham, poſitum.</note> and therefore the Latines ſay the word <hi>(nomen)</hi> ſignifying a name, comes from <hi>(notamen)</hi> a word which ſignifieth a mark of diſtinction. Whatſoever God is made known by, is called his name in Scripture, becauſe men, and all things elſe, are known by their names. Though ſome in a ſpecial manner are called <hi>men of name</hi> in Scripture (<hi>Gen.</hi> 6.4.) which we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore tranſlate <hi>men of renown;</hi> and men of no account or reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among men, are called <hi>men of no name:</hi> yet the pooreſt, the
<pb n="999" facs="tcp:48669:514"/> obſcureſt man hath a name, by which he is known and diſtinguiſht from other men. And as by names we diſtinguiſh perſons at preſent, ſo we preſerve the memory of perſons, and of their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and of their ſayings, whether good or bad for hereafter. How can it be cold who did, or who ſaid, this of that, unleſs we had their names who ſaid or did it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>He called,</hi> that is, <hi>Job called the name of,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>It is the fathers priviledge to give the name to his children.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>To give a name is an act of power; and therefore the Lord, as I ſhewed before, brought all the creatures to <hi>Adam</hi> as their Lord: Having ſaid (<hi>Gen.</hi> 1.28.) <hi>Have thou dominion over the beaſts of the earth, and the fowls of the air, and the fiſh of the ſea,</hi> He brought them to <hi>Adam,</hi> as their Lord, to receive their names (<hi>Gen.</hi> 2.19.) It is an act of great power either to give or to change names. When <hi>Saul</hi> (Acts 9.) was converted or changed, the Lord changed his name, he was no more called <hi>Saul,</hi> but <hi>Paul;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">In ſignum heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis poteſtatis.</note> being now become the Lords ſervant, and (as it were) one of his menial or houſhold ſervents, he gave him a new name. The Prince of the <hi>Eunuchs</hi> changed the names of <hi>Daniel</hi> and his three companions; <hi>He gave unto</hi> Daniel <hi>the name of</hi> Belteſhazzar, and to <hi>Hananiah</hi> of <hi>Shadrach,</hi> &amp;c. (<hi>Dan.</hi> 1.7.) Yet we read in Scripture that women very often gave names to their children. 'Tis conceived that <hi>Eve</hi> gave the name to <hi>Cain, I have gotten a man from the Lord</hi> (Gen. 4.1.) yea, as ſome expound her mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in thoſe, words, ſhe thought ſhe had gotten, <hi>That man the Lord,</hi> even the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>the promiſed ſeed</hi> (Gen. 3.15.) and then ſhe had gotten ſomewhat indeed, <hi>a poſſeſſion</hi> to purpoſe, as the name <hi>Cain</hi> ſignifieth. In the hiſtory of <hi>Jacob,</hi> we find the mothers, <hi>Leah</hi> and <hi>Rachel,</hi> ſtill giving the name (<hi>Gen.</hi> 29.32, 33, 34, 35. <hi>chap.</hi> 30.6, 8. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.20.) But as it is well diſtinguiſhed, though the nomination was often from the mother, yet the impoſition or confirmation of the name,<note place="margin">Nominatio à matre, impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio nominis à patro.</note> was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways from the father: the mother deſired the name, the father ratified it; as is plain in the caſe of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt (<hi>Luke</hi> 1.59.60, 61, 62, 63.) Friends preſent at his circumciſion <hi>called him</hi> Zacharias, <hi>after the name of his father; his mother anſwered, not

                  <q>He called the name of the ſecond Kezia.</q>
                  <p>That, in the Hebrew, ſignifieth a <hi>Spice</hi> or <hi>Perfume,</hi> a very fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant and pleaſant ſpice, of which Naturaliſts ſpeak much, and is commonly known by the name <hi>Caſſia,</hi> and ſo rendred (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.8.) <hi>All thy garments ſmell of Myrrh, Aloes and Caſſia:</hi> as if in Engliſh <hi>Job</hi> had called his ſecond daughters name, <hi>Sweet ſpice or perfume.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>And the name of the third Keren-happuch.</q>
                  <p>That's a compound word, from <hi>Keren,</hi> which ſignifieth <hi>a Horn;</hi> and <hi>Happuch,</hi> which among the Learned hath a double ſignification.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It ſignifieth a <hi>pouder,</hi> of which they made a kind of oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherewith proud ones painted themſelves, called in Latine <hi>Stibium.</hi> Some ſay it was a mineral; others ſay it was a plant growing in the Sea, which being ground to pouder, was of an
<pb n="1001" facs="tcp:48669:516"/> excellent redneſs in colour. Here the word <hi>Keren</hi> ſignifying <hi>a Horn,</hi> is prefixed to it, becauſe they uſed to preſerve ſuch painting-pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in a horn. We find this word <hi>Happuch</hi> made uſe of in the Verb (2 <hi>Kings</hi> 9.30.) where it is ſaid, that <hi>Jezebel</hi> hearing <hi>Jehu</hi> was come to <hi>Jezreel, Painted her face, and tired her head,</hi> &amp;c. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet alſo maketh uſe of it (<hi>Jer.</hi> 4.30.) when he would ſhew how unable anything ſhould be to do them good, the Lord being provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked by their evil deeds. True bodily beauty cannot, much leſs can a painted face procure them favour with men, with whom the Lord is angry for their wickedneſs and ſoul-pollutions; and therefore, ſaith the Prophet there, <hi>Though thou cloatheſt thy ſelf with crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and deckeſt thy ſelf with ornaments of gold, though thou renteſt thy face with painting, in vain ſhalt thou make thy ſelf fair, thy lovers will deſpiſe thee, they will ſeek thy life.</hi> When he ſaith, <hi>Though thou renteſt thy ſelf with painting,</hi> it is only to ſhew, that though they did their beſt, and uſed their utmoſt skill to make themſelves look fair, though they ſhould rub their faces with this vermillion, till they crack'd their very skin, yet it would do them no good, the enemy would not be enamoured with them, nor pity, nor ſpare them for their fine cloaths and fair faces.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Others derive this word <hi>Happuch</hi> from a root, which ſignifieth <hi>to turn,</hi> and then the ſence of the Text is, <hi>He called the name of the third Keren-happuch,</hi> that is, <hi>The horn of converſion, or of turning.</hi> I ſhall give the reaſon of that tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by-and-by. The Septuagint render it by a word which ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth <hi>Plenty, The horn of plenty.</hi> But I conceive our rendring moſt proper: He called her name <hi>Keren-happuch,</hi> that is, <hi>The horn of beauty,</hi> alluding to the cuſtom of proud women, who to make themſelves look fair, and ſo to enſnare others with their beauty, anointed or painted themſelves with that tincturing ſtuff. Thus we have the ſignification of theſe names.</p>
                  <p>But why did <hi>Job</hi> give his daughters ſuch names as theſe?</p>
                  <p>Firſt, I ſuppoſe this may be given as a reaſon of it, That he might in theſe names remember, or be minded of, his wonderful reſtoration. God having brought him out of a low and miſerable eſtate, to a very high and comfortable one, he therefore called the name of the firſt <hi>Jemima,</hi> that is, <hi>Day,</hi> to ſignifie that he who before was in a night, a dark night of ſadneſs and ſorrow, of trouble and adverſity, was now come to a comfortable day of
<pb n="1002" facs="tcp:48669:517"/> proſperity. The Scripture ſaith, <hi>Light is ſown for the righteous.</hi> They may be in the dark, in a dark day, in a day as dark as night, and where the very light (as <hi>Job</hi> ſpake, Chap. 10.) is as dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but there is a Day coming, <hi>Light is ſown for the righteous. Job</hi> might ſay, I have been in the dark night of affliction, but now 'tis break of day with me; and therefore that I may remember this goodneſs of God, my firſt daughter ſhall be named <hi>Day,</hi> that her name may help me to remember the goodneſs of God all my dayes.</p>
                  <p>Again, When he called his ſecond daughter <hi>Kezia,</hi> that alſo might refer to his new <hi>ſtate.</hi> As if he had ſaid, My former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of ſtink and filth is paſſed away; I once ſate (as it were) upon a dunghil, being little better than dung my ſelf, full of ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerous ſoars; my breath ſavour'd ſo ill, that my Wife could not endure me, and I was an offence to all neer me: but now the Lord hath renewed my fleſh, as the fleſh of a child, now I am ſweet and clean, my ſavour is like a perfume; and therefore my ſecond daughters name ſhall be <hi>Kezia, Spice or perfume.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Job</hi> might alſo ſay, My late affliction was a ſtate of deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I was black and uncomely, my face was all as a ſcab, and my body as a ſore, my countenance was ſlurr'd with tears and weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as he complained, Chap. 16.16.) there was no beauty in me; <hi>Job</hi> might ſay of himſelf in that ſtate, as it is ſaid of Chriſt in the Propheſie, <hi>When we beheld him there was no beauty, no comelineſs in him:</hi> but now my ſores are healed, now I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered my former ſtrength, freſhneſs and comelineſs; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the name of this daughter ſhall be, <hi>The horn of beauty,</hi> to mind me how the Lord hath <hi>given me beauty for aſhes, and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of joy for a ſpirit of heavineſs.</hi> Thus he might very well, and very piouſly, give his children theſe names, to mind him of the bleſſed change which the Lord had made in his outward conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And this is the reaſon of that tranſlation before mentioned, of the name of the third daughter, called <hi>Keren-happuch, The horn of Converſion,</hi> intimating how great a change the Lord had made in his horn; his horn was in the duſt before, it was empty and had nothing in it but filth, whereas now is become or turned to be a <hi>Horn of plenty. Jobs</hi> eſtate was changed from po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty to plenty, and his horn raiſed from the duſt to honour and dignity; and therefore he called the name of his third daughter
<pb n="1003" facs="tcp:48669:517"/> 
                     <hi>Keren-happuch, The horn of Converſion,</hi> or, <hi>The change of the Horn.</hi> Thus <hi>Job</hi> might have great reaſon to call his daughters by theſe names, with reſpect to the change of his condition.</p>
                  <p>Hence obſerve;
<q>Godly Parents do well, when they give ſuch names to their children, as may be memorials of the providences of God towards them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Joſeph</hi> had a mighty turn in his eſtate, as the <hi>Pſalmist</hi> epito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mizeth the Hiſtory of <hi>Moſes</hi> in <hi>Geneſis</hi> concerning him (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 105.17, 18, 19, 20, <hi>&amp;c.) He was ſold for a ſervent, his feet were hurt with fetters, he was laid in irons, until the time that his word came; the word of the Lord tryed him: The King ſent and looſed him, he made him Lord of his houſe, and Ruler of all his ſubſtance,</hi> &amp;c. This <hi>Joſeph</hi> had two ſons in the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> after this turn of his eſtate; but what were their names? The Text anſwers (<hi>Gen.</hi> 41.51, 52.) <hi>And he called the name of his firſt-born Manaſſeth,</hi> which ſignifieth <hi>forgetfulneſs;</hi> and he giveth this reaſon of it; for (ſaid he) <hi>God hath made me forget all my toyl, and all my fathers houſe. And the name of the ſecond called he Ephraim,</hi> which ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth <hi>fruitful;</hi> for (ſaid he) <hi>God hath cauſed me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.</hi> He was once very much afflicted, and now he was very fruitful; therefore, he called the name of his younger ſon, <hi>Ephraim,</hi> that he might remember the kindneſs of God to him, as often as he beheld or ſpake to, or of, that ſon. So <hi>Moſes</hi> called his ſon <hi>Gerſhom</hi> (ſtranger) <hi>for he ſaid, I have been a ſtranger in a ſtrange Land (Exod.</hi> 2.22.) We find alſo names given to things, as well as to perſons, by way of remembrance. Thus (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.12.) after a great victory obtained againſt the <hi>Philiſtines, Samuel</hi> ſet up a ſtone, and gave it a name, <hi>He called it Eben-ezar,</hi> or the <hi>Stone of help:</hi> The reaſon was, <hi>for</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>hitherto the Lord hath helped us.</hi> The name of the ſtone, was, to mind them of the Lords conſtant readineſs to help them, even unto that day. So <hi>Moſes (Exod.</hi> 17.) after that great deliverance from the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> built an Altar, and <hi>called it Jehovah niſſi,</hi> which ſignifieth, <hi>the Lord is my Banner,</hi> to put them in remembrance how the Lord went forth as a man of War, and mightily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded their enemies. There is a prudence to be uſed in the names, both of things and perſons. We read (<hi>Gen.</hi> 10.25.)
<pb n="1004" facs="tcp:48669:518"/> 
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto Eber were born two ſons, and the name of the one he called Peleg;</hi> and why <hi>Peleg? for in his days</hi> (ſaith that Text) <hi>was the earth divided. Peleg</hi> ſignifieth diviſion. The whole world, which lay before as one common field in his days, was divided and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toniz'd into ſeveral Countries, therefore his name was called <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leg.</hi> And, as many names have been given from paſt or preſent providences, ſo ſome names have been given, as it were, by Propheſie, with reſpect to after providences (<hi>Gen.</hi> 5.29.) <hi>Lamech lived a hundred eighty and two years, and begat a ſon, and called his name Noah,</hi> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> ſignifieth reſt. Why ſo? not from a providence that was paſt or preſent, but from what he believed ſhould be; <hi>For this ſame</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>ſhall comfort us concerning our work and toyl of our hands, becauſe of the ground which the Lord hath curſed.</hi> Thus much of the names of <hi>Jobs</hi> daughters, as they ſignified the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences of God towards him, and the turn of his ſtate.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We may conſider theſe nemes, with reference to the perſonal qualifications or endowments of his daughters, and thoſe twofold; Firſt, their corporal &amp; external qualifications. Secondly, their ſpiritual &amp; internal qualifications, which we may well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive <hi>Job</hi> had a chief reſpect unto, in giving them theſe names.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>He called the names of the firſt Jemima,</hi> or, <hi>Day,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſignifying, Firſt, the clear natural beauty of that daughter, or the brightneſs of her complexion like the brightneſs of the day, or as if ſhe ſhined in beauty like the day, when beautified by the beams of the Sun. Thus Chriſt ſpake of the Church (<hi>Cant.</hi> 6.10.) <hi>Who is ſhe that looketh forth as the morning, fair as the Moon, clear as the Sun? Jobs</hi> eldeſt daughter looked forth as the day, ſhe was of a reſplendent comelineſs: and we may well ſuppoſe, <hi>Job,</hi> who gave her this name, had prayed ſhe might have, and hoped ſhe would have, and doubtleſs in her time ſhe had not only a beautiful face, and a comly feature of body, but (which is far better) a beautiful ſoul, a well-featured diſpoſition of mind, much grace and goodneſs; in which ſenſe, the Church (in the place laſt mentioned) is ſaid <hi>to look forth as the morning, to be fair as the Moon, and clear as the Sun.</hi> The name <hi>Day,</hi> doth very well ſhadow, both the virgin beauty of the body, and the divine unſpotted beauty of the ſoul. Secondly, he might call her ſo, thereby ſignifying, that as the day is ſweet and pleaſant, ſo was ſhe, both as to her bodily aſpect in comelineſs, and the aſpect of
<pb n="1005" facs="tcp:48669:518"/> her ſoul in holineſs. Thirdly, (ſay ſome) he called her name <hi>Day,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>na dies ape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ſuſturit uno dies.</note> becauſe beauty (bodily beauty they mean) is of no long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, it is but, as it were, for a day; like a flower, which a day opens and withers.</p>
                  <p>He called the ſecond <hi>Kezia,</hi> or as one of the Ancients ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, <hi>Caſſia,</hi> ſignifying <hi>ſpice and perfume,</hi> to note that ſhe was of a fragrant temper, of a winning diſpoſition and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. Grace and vertue yield the ſweeteſt ſmell in the noſtrils of God, and of all good men. The Church (<hi>Cant.</hi> 1.3.) ſaith of Chriſt, <hi>Becauſe of the ſavour of thy good ointments, thy name is an ointment poured forth; therefore do the virgins love thee.</hi> Theſe ointments were the precious graces of Chriſt. 'Tis ſo in ſome proportion, with all the godly; their ointments (the unction of the Spirit poured upon them) caſt a delightful ſavour. <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> ſaith (<hi>Eccl.</hi> 7.1.) <hi>A good name is better than precious oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> A good name, ariſing from good qualities, from grace re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and acted, is the moſt precious ointment, more precious than all the ointments which affect the ſenſe. To be <hi>Jemima,</hi> beautiful in body as the day, and not to be <hi>Kezia,</hi> not to have a ſpirit ſweet as <hi>Caſſia,</hi> what is it, but a piece of pageantry, or gild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon a common poſt?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Job</hi> called the name of the 3d <hi>Keren-happuch,</hi> or, <hi>Horn of beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi> Firſt, with reſpect to her out-ſide, intimating, that ſhe was a great beauty. Some ſay, ſhe was called <hi>Keren-happuch</hi> by an <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiphraſis,</hi> becauſe <hi>ſhe needed not, much leſs uſed, the horn of beauty to make her ſelf beautiful;</hi> ſhe was even beauty it ſelf: Her natural beauty exceeded all that artificial beauty which proud women make ſhew of, by painting their faces. She was alſo <hi>a horn of beauty,</hi> as to her graces and ſpiritual endowments. Thus <hi>Job</hi> might give his daughters theſe names, not only with reſpect to the change of his condition, but conſidering the conditions of his daughters, both with reſpect to their bodily beauty, and the divine excellency of grace beſtowed upon their ſouls.</p>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>It is good to give names, exciting to vertue and to duty.</q>

                     </gap>poſition. 'Tis better to be a crooked ſhrub in bodily ſtature, than a tall ſtrait Palm-tree with a crooked mind, and a low ſpirit. To be named <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mima,</hi> as fair as Day; to be named <hi>Kezia,</hi> as ſweet as ſpice or perfume; to be called <hi>Keren-happuch,</hi> as beautiful as the very horn of beauty; what will it advantage any women, unleſs they have real vertues, and gracious qualities anſwering theſe names? Yea, theſe names will be real witneſſes againſt them at laſt, and fill their faces with ſhame. To profeſs our ſelves to be, or to have a name to be, what we are not, is to be deeply hypocritical; and to bear that in our names which we are not, nor take any care to be, is highly diſgraceful. But when names are fulfilled in perſons; when men and women, who wear good names, are or do the good ſignified by their names, how precious are their names! and their memories, how honorable! And when the good or vertues of the three feminine names in the Text meet and center in the perſon of any one woman; when <hi>Jemima,</hi> the day-light of true knowledge and underſtanding is joyned with <hi>Kezia,</hi> the perfume of reputation, aſcending from <hi>Keren-happuch,</hi> ſtore of beautiful graces, put forth in the gracious actions of a ſpotleſs and unblameable converſation; what Pencil is able to draw to the life the raviſhing features of ſuch a perſon? Such, I believe, were thoſe noble Ladies, <hi>Jobs</hi> daughters, named in the Text, which was the joy of their fathers heart, and the ſtaff of his old age.</p>
                  <p>Thus much of the names of <hi>Jobs</hi> daughters, and of the ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of them; both in reference to the then preſent change of <hi>Jobs</hi> eſtate, and the hope he had of their future good eſtate; with reſpect to the beauty and gracefulneſs of their bodies, but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to the beauty and graciouſneſs of their ſouls or minds.</p>

                  </p>

                  <p>Hence note;
<q>The bodily beauty of our children is a gift of God, and no ſmall one.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beauty is not only one of the excellencies of nature, but ſome part of Gods image in man, and much reſpected in women.<note place="margin">Species corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris ſimulacrum eſt mentis &amp; figura probita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis. <hi>Amb.</hi> l. <hi>2.</hi> de virgin.</note> The beauty of the body, bears the image of a beautiful mind, and is a figure of holineſs; hence that Scripture phraſe, <hi>The beauty of holineſs.</hi> It is ſaid of <hi>Moſes, He was a goodly child;</hi> and of <hi>Sarah,</hi> that ſhe was a very beautiful woman; ſo beautiful, that <hi>Abraham</hi> was afraid her beauty might endanger him among ſtrangers. <hi>Rebeccah</hi> alſo was beautiful, and very fair;<note place="margin">Gratior eſt pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chro veniens è corpore virtus.</note> and though beauty is no grace, yet it is a grace to grace. <hi>Beauty is, and duly may be, a great attractive of love and affection:</hi> Though we know it is often an incentive to luſt, yet it is an attractive of true love. What is ſaid of the Church (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.11.) <hi>So ſhall the King greatly deſire thy beauty,</hi> thy ſpiritual or inward beauty, is true alſo of outward or corporal beauty. Beauty to ſome is a portion among men; to others, a favour from God. Beauty is a ſilent eloquence, a tacit perſwaſion, it works much. But conſider, I ſpeak of that beauty firſt, which is natural, not artificial; I ſpeak not of <hi>beauty out of a box,</hi> but of that which is laid on by the hand of God, that's a bleſſing and a mercy, then eſpecially, when it is joyned with better beauty. Only remember, though bodily beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be a bleſſing, it is but an inferior bleſſing; it is a gift of God, yet an inferior gift: And there are many conſiderations which may keep them humble in their own thoughts, who are moſt beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful in the eyes of others.</p>
                  <p>For, Firſt, As beauty is a bleſſing, ſo it is a ſnare oftentimes; and that in two reſpects.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It proveth a ſnare to them that have it.<note place="margin">Faſtus ineſt pulchris, ſequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turque ſuperbia formam.</note> If they have not grace, it maketh them proud and vain; ſuch are often given up to new-fangled inventions; their natural beauty will nor ſerve
<pb n="1010" facs="tcp:48669:521"/> them, they muſt have artifical ſet-offs. Again, much beauty maketh many diſdainful of others; and they who are ſo, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the diſdain of God; and it had been much better for ſuch, if they had been the verieſt <hi>Doudes</hi> (as ſome call unhandſome ones) or the moſt deformed creatures in the world. Therefore (I ſay) remember there is a ſnare in beauty to thoſe that have it; yet by how much beauty hath the more temptation in it, by ſo much are they the more to be commended, who being beautiful, overcome thoſe temptations, and continue humble, modeſt, chaſt, diſcreet, and diligent, avoiding evil, with all the occaſions of it, turning from every vanity, and doing good.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Beauty is often a ſnare to others. When the Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Captive Ladies were preſented to <hi>Alexander the Great,</hi> he call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, <hi>The ſores or pain of the eyes;</hi> He was afraid they might wholly conquer him, who had conquered ſo great a part of the world. What reaſon have any to be proud of that, which may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnare, and ſo undo, both themſelves and others?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Conſider there is nothing more frail, nor ſooner loſt than bodily beauty. A little ſorrow, a few tears, ſpoil and fully a a fair face; a fit of ſickneſs withereth beauty, and, inevitably, old age will do it;<note place="margin">Eſt exigui do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num breve temporù. <hi>Sen.</hi> in Hippol.</note> at beſt, 'tis quickly gone, and every day, when once at beſt, abates it; the longer you have it, the leſs you have of it. Some conceive (as I toucht before) that <hi>Job</hi> called his eldeſt daughter <hi>Jemima, Day,</hi> becauſe beauty laſteth but as it were a day; one day bloweth it, and another day blaſteth it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Formae omnes inſidiantur.</note>Thirdly, Beauty endangers the weaker ſex to become a prey to the luſts of adulterous men, who often lye in wait for ſuch a booty. So then, though beauty be a bleſſing, yet we have little reaſon to be proud of it, if theſe three things be true (as who can deny the truth of any one of them) which have been ſaid of it; and three times three things more might be ſaid of it, with as much truth, to take all off from over-much valuing it, or to abate our valuation of it.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, above all, look to the beauty of the mind, that's a beauty worth the ſtriving after; and that is trueſt bodily beauty, which is adorned with ſoul-beauty, or when the beauty of come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs is aſſociated with the beauty of holineſs. It had been no great matter of commendation to <hi>Jobs</hi> daughters, that they were
<pb n="1011" facs="tcp:48669:521"/> the faireſt women in all the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nd, if they had not been the holieſt. The beauty of the mind is ten thouſand times more commendable than that of the body; the King of heaven deſires ſuch beauty. It is not a naturally fair face that will make the Lord Jeſus deſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e you; and as for an artificially fair, that will cauſe the Lord Jeſus to abhor you. <hi>The Kings daughter is all glorious within</hi> (Pſal. 45.13.) her glory is a ſpiritual glory. <hi>Solomon</hi> hath told us what natural beauty is without ſpiritual (<hi>Prov.</hi> 11.22.) <hi>As a jewel in a ſwines ſnout, ſo is a fair woman which is without diſcretion;</hi> eſpecially, that fair woman is ſo, <hi>who</hi> (as the Margin hath it) <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parteth from diſcretion.</hi> They are truly beautiful and lovely, who have beautiful diſpoſitions, and follow beautiful and lovely actions. The Lord ſaid of the Jewiſh Church (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.14.) <hi>Thy renown went forth among the heathen for beauty; for it was perfect through my comelineſs which I had put upon thee.</hi> But what was the comelineſs which God had put upon her? It was the comelineſs of divine gifts and graces planted in her, and exerciſed or held out by her. That's the ornament with which the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, the good women in the old time adorned themſelves, even <hi>the hidden man of the heart, a meek and quiet ſpirit</hi> (1 Epiſt. 3.4, 5.) And let men as well as women ſtrive for theſe orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. They that are deformed in perſon, may more than make it up, by being conformed to Chriſt in their ways and works. Better be deformed in body, and conformed to Chriſt, than to have a well-proportion'd comely body, and no conformity unto Chriſt. It hath been ſaid of ſome wiſe and worthy men, that <hi>their ſouls were ill-houſed,</hi> that is, they had ill ſhap'd or unhandſome bodies. But though the houſe of the body be mean and deſpicable, yet if the inhabitant, or the ſoul, be wiſe and good, that makes a mends for all outward deficiencies, yea, for deformities and monſtroſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; whereas if the houſe of the body be never ſo well framed and built, yet if it be inhabited by a proud, unclean, ignorant, impious ſoul, how doth that ſpoil, defile, and diſhonour that body, and make it no better than a darkſome dungeon.</p>
                  <p>So far concerning the names of <hi>Jobs</hi> daughters, who being qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified in body and mind according to the import of their names, were themſelves portion enough to any husband; yet <hi>Job</hi> did not put them off ſo, but gave an honourable ſhare of his plentiful eſtate to them, as it followeth,
<q>
                        <pb n="1012" facs="tcp:48669:522"/>And their father gave them inheritance among their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And well they deſerved it. <hi>Their father gave them.</hi> He made the diſtribution to prevent contention, which often falls out among children (and poſſibly might among <hi>Jobs</hi>) about their fathers eſtate. This was a high favour, and ſomewhat unuſual, to give daughters inheritance among their brethren; they uſe only to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit, when they have no brethren. For among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and probably among the <hi>Idumeans,</hi> it was a cuſtome, and it paſt into a law among the <hi>Jews,</hi> that ſons ſhould have the whole inheritance; the reaſon was, becauſe their families and inheritances were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved diſtinct by the male, not ſo by the females. The Hebrew word for a male ſignifies <hi>Remembrance,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">

                     </note> but that for a female <hi>Forgetfulneſs;</hi> becauſe daughters loſe the name of their family in marriage, and therefore daughters did not inherit, but when there was no male iſſue. Thus it was in the caſe of the daughters of <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lophehad,</hi> their father left no ſon, &amp; ſo they inherited (<hi>Num.</hi> 27.7.) An immoveable inheritance came not to daughters; they had only a moveable inheritance.<note place="margin">Illud <hi>Inter,</hi> vel ut in Hebraeo eſt in medio fratrum aequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litatem quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munem ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem denotat. <hi>Pined.</hi>
                     </note> But <hi>Job</hi> giving his daughters inheritance among their brethren, implyeth (as ſome Interpreters conceive) that they had an equal inheritance in lands with their brethren, which is alſo the opinion of our Annotators; as if out of love to them, and in reward of their vertues, he gave to every one of them, as to his ſons, a portion of land to inherit, ſo that they ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red proportionally with their brethren, by their fathers Will and Teſtament, and were coheirs with them in his eſtate equally.</p>

                     </note>Yet thoſe words, <hi>among or in the midſt of their brethren,</hi> note, faith another Expoſitor, only an equality in their good qualities &amp; vertues. I ſuppoſe, if you take <hi>equally</hi> in <hi>a ſtrict ſenſe,</hi> that is, juſt as much, foot for foot, penny for penny, they did not inherit equally; but if we take it in <hi>a common or large ſenſe,</hi> ſo they had as great an inheritance as their b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ethren, they had as much for daughters, as their brethren for ſons. <hi>Their fathers gave them inheritance among their brethren.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note, Firſt;
<q>It is the fathers duty to provide for his Children.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>(1 Tim. 5.8.) <hi>If any provide not for his own, and ſpecially
<pb n="1013" facs="tcp:48669:522"/> for thoſe of his own houſe, he hath denied the faith, and is worſe than an infidel.</hi> The Apoſtles meaning is, in that point, he hath denied the faith, and doth not carry it like a believer, no, nor ſo well as unbelievers or infidels commonly do.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Their father gave them inheritance.</p>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>It is the fathers priviledge to diſpoſe of his eſtate to his children.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Children muſt not take their portions; their father muſt give it them. Children muſt not carve to themſelves: It is the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the father to diſpoſe of what he hath, according to right and reaſon, and the law of the place.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Who were they that had this gift, they were his daughters, <hi>Their father gave them inheritance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>Daughters are to be provided for, as well as ſons.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some fathers are all for their ſons, and neglect their daughters altogether. Sons ſhould not be denied their priviledge, and daughters ſhould not be unprovided for. Sons bear up the name of the family, and daughters may bring both ſtrength and honour to the family; by matching into worthy families.</p>
                  <p>Note, Fourthly;
<q>The better daughters are, the better ſhould parents, father or mother, do and provide for them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The reaſon why <hi>Job</hi> went ſo high, to give his daughters inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance among their brethren, was, becauſe his daughters were not only beautiful, but dutiful, and though women by ſex, yet of a maſculine ſpirit. The very grammer of the Text (as ſome take notice) leads us to this ground of their fathers bounty and noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to them; he dealt with them as with ſons, becauſe they had the vertues of ſons;; for in three places the Holy Ghoſt uſeth the maſculine affixe (מ <hi>mem</hi>) where (according to ordinary rule) he ſhould uſe the feminine (נ <hi>nun</hi>) to ſhew (ſay they) that <hi>Job</hi> was not moved by fond affection to his daughters, but ſound judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; he ſeing them exceed their ſex in vertue, equall'd them in his fatherly proviſion, with thoſe who were of a more excellent
<pb n="1014" facs="tcp:48669:523"/> ſex, and dealt with them as with ſons in their degree.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Obſerve;
<q>Children ought to be ſatisfied with their fathers pleaſure in diſpoſing his eſtate among them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>We do not hear that there was any diſcontent in the ſons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the daughters had ſo much; nor in the daughters, becauſe they had no more: both reſted in what their father was pleaſed to do for them. How much more ſhould we reſt content with that portion and inheritance which our father in heaven provides for us? and indeed he will give all his daughters at laſt inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance among his ſons: For as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh with reſpect to grace, ſo 'tis true in reſpect to glory, <hi>There is neither male nor female; but Chriſt is all and in all.</hi> The grace of God is not more to the male than to the female; and, as it is in the giving of grace here, ſo it will be in the diſtribution of glory hereafter: Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and ſiſters, husbands and wives, who are heirs of the ſame grace of life, ſhall be all heirs together in the life of glory, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> in the glorious life; and therefore let us be content with what por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or inheritance our heavenly father is pleaſed to give us, to allor, or allow us in this life.</p>

                     </gap>ve to report the opinion, both of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Writers, and of ſeveral others, both Greek and Latine, concerning that point.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It is generally agreed by the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Writers, and by moſt of the Latines, that <hi>Job</hi> was threeſcore and ten years old at the concluſion of his trouble; and if he were ſeventy when his trouble ended, adding an hundred and forty more after the end of his trouble, it makes up juſt two hundred and ten years, as the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral account of his whole life. Thus the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Doctors conclude the race of <hi>Jobs</hi> life, as long as the abode of the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Egppt,</hi> after their coming thither, till their going out.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The ſeventy Interpreters give another reckoning, both of the time he lived after his affliction, and of the time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and ſo conſequentially of his whole life; for thus they tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate, <hi>After this trouble,</hi> Job <hi>lived an hundred and ſeventy-years; and all the dayes which</hi> Job <hi>lived, were two hundred and forty years.</hi> Thus they render the Text, but by what warrant I do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand. The ground of this addition, by which ſome endeavour to preſerve the credit of that tranſlation, is this; The Septua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gint (ſay they) by <hi>after this,</hi> do not underſtand only the time when <hi>Job</hi> was juſt come out of his troubles, but, by <hi>after this,</hi> they mean the whole time that <hi>Job</hi> was recovering out of his trouble, and growing up into that greatneſs. As if the meaning of thoſe words, <hi>after this,</hi> were to be taken thus: After <hi>Jobs</hi> cattel were doubled, and his Family was compleated, after he had ſeven ſons and three daughters born unto him, and after his daughters ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
<pb n="1017" facs="tcp:48669:524"/> to be according to their names, and the report made of them in the former context, the faireſt women in all the Land of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>z;</hi> and after he had diſpoſed of them in marriage, to his comfort and content, after all this was in doing and done, he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved an hundred and forty years. Now, for the doing of all this, they allow thirty years, which being added to the hundred and forty years in the Text, make up the full ſum of an hundred and ſeventy years, as they tranſlate; to which, if we add ſeventy years, which is ſuppoſed to have been the time of his life, when his troubles ended, then the total amounts to two hundred and forty years, which the Septuagint in their tranſlation ſay he lived.</p>
                  <p>But it may ſuffice to mention this, it being only the opinion, and poſſibly the miſtake of thoſe ancient Tranſlaters. We have no more in Scripture, but that he lived an hundred and forty years after his troubles were ended; and taking it ſtrictly ſo, he muſt needs be a very old man, for he was a perfect man, and had ten children before his troubles began.</p>
                  <q>After this lived <hi>Job</hi> an hundred and forty years.</q>
                  <p>But why doth the Spirit of God reckon up his years? Surely to ſet forth a further bleſſing beſtowed upon <hi>Job,</hi> than as yet had been named, even the bleſſing of long life. All that is ſpoken of him, is in a way of mercy; and to make the meaſure of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies full, this is added or caſt in, that <hi>he lived</hi> after the dayes of his trouble were ended, <hi>an hundred and forty years.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>Long life is to be reckoned among divine bleſſings; and 'tis a right-hand bleſſing <hi>(Prov. 3.16.)</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Job</hi> had many bleſſings of this life, but his long life on earth was the chiefeſt of meer earthly bleſſings. The firſt Ages of the world had very long livers: <hi>Adam,</hi> the firſt man, lived well to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a thouſand years, compleat nine hundred and thirty years, after he was created (<hi>Gen.</hi> 5.5.) which being in a perfect mans eſtate, we may well reckon him as a man of neer a thouſand years old, and neerer to a thouſand than <hi>Methuſalah,</hi> when he dyed. That whole Chaprer is a clear proof, that all before the Flood lived to a great age.</p>
                  <pb n="1018" facs="tcp:48669:525"/>
                  <p>Four reaſons may be aſſigned, why the thread of mans life was drawn out to ſo great a length, in thoſe early ages of the world.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That they might learn the works of Creation, and be skilled in the courſe of nature, which, having no books nor ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent ſtudies of men, they muſt collect by obſervation.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, They lived long, that they might inſtruct others in what themſelves had obſerved.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, They lived long, that mankind might be multiplied; for of thoſe long livers (<hi>Gen.</hi> 5.) when the firſt-born is mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it is ſtill added, they lived ſo many hundred years after, and begat ſons and daughters.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, They lived very long, that they might both invent and perfect thoſe Arts and Sciences with which the world after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward abounded, when drawn into writing, and ſet forth by rule. And though after the Flood, the years of the longeſt livers were much ſhort of theirs, yet the holy Patriarchs received a great ſhare of his bleſſing. <hi>Abraham</hi> lived an hundred ſeventy and five years (<hi>Gen.</hi> 25.7.) <hi>Iſaac</hi> lived ſomething longer, an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fourſcore years (<hi>Gen.</hi> 35.20.) <hi>Jacob</hi> lived an hundred forty and ſeven (<hi>Gen.</hi> 47.28.) <hi>Joſeph</hi> lived an hundred and ten years (<hi>Gen</hi> 50. <hi>ult) Job,</hi> if we take in that common ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the antecedent part of his life, lived longer than any of theſe, even two hundred and ten years. The fifth Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath this promiſe (<hi>Exod.</hi> 20.12.) <hi>Honour thy Father and thy Mother, that thy dayes may be long in the Land, which the Lord thy God giveth thee.</hi> And the Apoſtle calls that the firſt Commandement with promiſe (<hi>Eph.</hi> 6.2.) that is, the firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement with an explicite promiſe (all the Commandements have promiſes implyed to thoſe that obey them) <hi>Eliphaz</hi> aſſured <hi>Job</hi> of this bleſſing, in caſe of his repentance (Chap. 5.26.) <hi>Thou ſhalt come to thy grave in a full age, like as a ſhock of Corn cometh in his ſeaſon:</hi> And in this he was a true Prophet.</p>
                  <p>Now, that long life is a bleſſing, I would ſhew briefly, under theſe ſix conſiderations.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It is a bleſſing to have a long opportunity of doing good, of being uſeful and ſerviceable to our generation; long life gives an advantage for that.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is a bleſſing to have opportunity to gain experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; Firſt, of the various providences of God towards men, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="1019" facs="tcp:48669:525"/> in wayes of judgement or of mercy. Secondly, to get ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences of the manners of men, of the vanity, unfaithfulneſs and inconſtancy of ſome men, and of the goodneſs, faithfulneſs and conſtancy of others. Though we ſometimes ſmart in getting our experiences, yet it may be a great bleſſing to have them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It is a bleſſing to have an opportunity to hold forth the grace of God to us, and the graces of God in us, by a holy example. The longer we live a natural life, the more we may ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt the power of a ſpiritual life, to thoſe among whom we live.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, It is a bleſſing to have opportunity for improvement and growth in grace, to attain the higheſt ſtature in, and pitch of holineſs. This benefit we may make of long life, even encreaſe in grace, as our years encreaſe, and grow better as we grow older.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, It is a bleſſing to have opportunity to bring up our children in the nurture and fear of God; long life gives liberty for this.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, it is a bleſſing to behold the bleſsing of God upon our poſterity; long life gives us opportunity for this bleſsing, and this was <hi>Jobs</hi> bleſsing eminently. In all theſe reſpects, and many more might be added, long life is a bleſsing.</p>
                  <p>Yet, let me give this corrective, <hi>Long life is but a common bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing;</hi> it is no diſtinguiſhing bleſsing, it is not a certain love-token from God to man. Bad men have lived long, as appears both in ſacred and common Hiſtories. Old age is then a bleſsing, and good indeed, when we are old in goodneſs, or grow old doing good. <hi>Solomons</hi> concluſion reacheth this fully (<hi>Prov.</hi> 16.31.) <hi>The hoary head is a crown of glory, if it be found in the way of righteouſneſs:</hi> And <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us in <hi>Eccleſiaſtes, Better is a child that will be ruled, than an old and fooliſh King that will receive no counſel.</hi> When we may ſay of any, as the Lord ſaid of ſome (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 23.43.) <hi>O ye that are old in adulteries;</hi> when any are old in ſin, woe to ſuch an old age. Better to die young, than live to old age, and then die in ſin. To live to be old men, the old man not dying in us, O how ſad! To ſee ſin young, when the man is old, how odious a ſight is that! Then only old age is good, when we are good in old age. They only die in a good old age (as it is ſaid of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> Gen. 25.8.) who are good dying old. <hi>The ſinner of a
<pb n="1020" facs="tcp:48669:526"/> hundred years old ſhall die accurſed. (Iſa.</hi> 65.20.) So then, it is knowing, not ignorant old age; it is prudent, not fooliſh old age; it is gracious, not vicious old age, which is indeed the bleſsing; and therefore, though it be a bleſsing, look upon it as a common bleſsing. As riches are good to us, our ſelves being good; ſo is old age, ſuch is a life of many years in this world, good only to thoſe who are good, and do good.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, When it is ſaid, <hi>Job</hi> lived an hundred and forty years, we are not to take <hi>his living</hi> for a bare continuance or indurance in life, for ſo many years; but we are to underſtand his life or living ſo long,<note place="margin">Vivere eſt valere.</note> with the cloathing of it, with the good of it: <hi>he lived,</hi> that is, he lived comfortably, honourably, peaceably, this hundred and forty years. We commonly ſay, <hi>To live is to be well; to live, is to flouriſh.</hi> Some live, whoſe life is a kind of death. As they who live in (ſinful) pleaſure, are dead while they live, ſo alſo are they who live in great worldly ſorrow. <hi>Job</hi> lived comfortably and contentedly all that long time of his latter life, even an hundred and forty years.</p>
                  <p>Hence note, Secondly;
<q>Long life, in health, peace and proſperity, is a bleſsing indeed.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>To live long in the enjoyment of good, is very good. <hi>What man is he</hi> (ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 34.12.) <hi>that deſireth life, and loveth many dayes, that he may ſee good? Keep thy tongue from evil,</hi> &amp;c. To live long and <hi>ſee good,</hi> that is, enjoy good, is the utmoſt that can be deſired in this life. That's the bleſſing, or the good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed in the renewed ſtate of <hi>Jeruſalem (Iſa.</hi> 65.) where, after the Lord had ſpoken of new heavens and new earth, he adds, at the 22d verſe, <hi>They ſhall not build, and another inhabit; they ſhall not plant, and another eat; for as the dayes of a tree, are the dayes of my people, and mine elect ſhall long enjoy the work of their hands.</hi> He doth not ſay, they ſhall live long, but they ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy long; that which they have built and planted, none ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade nor take away from them. Some conceive, this hath refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the thouſand years, propheſied of (<hi>Rev.</hi> 20.) wherein the Church ſhall enjoy perfect felicity in this world. To live long in the ſweet enjoyments of health, honour, peace and plenty, for ſoul and body, is a full bleſsing. I grant, ſome good men live long, who yet do not alwayes enjoy good; their old age eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="1021" facs="tcp:48669:526"/> is accompanied and encumbered with many bodily diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers and grievous pains. Though grace ſets us above the decayes of nature, and the troubles of this life, yet grace doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt nor give us priviledge from either; ſo that greedineſs after many years, is commonly a greedineſs only after many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities. <hi>Iſaac</hi> was a good old man, yet 'tis ſaid of him, that <hi>when he was old, his eyes waxed dim, ſo that he could not ſee (Gen.</hi> 27.1.) Old age, and dim eyes, and deaf ears, ſhaking hands, and palſied trembling joynts, with manifold diſeaſes, are ſeldom found aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: Therefore, <hi>Job</hi> had an extraordinary bleſsing, to live long and free from all theſe evils, and ſo have any who do ſo. <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zillay</hi> was a good old man, yet (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.25.) he was ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nummed, and his natural ſenſes ſo enfeebled, that he did not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy his life; <hi>Can I</hi> (ſaid he to <hi>David,</hi> who invited him to a Court-life, <hi>Can I) any more taſt what I eat or drink?</hi> &amp;c. That's a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed old age, when we live long, and enjoy comfort with our lives, chiefly when we enjoy the comforts, and act the duties of a ſpiritual life.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Conſider, <hi>Job</hi> was afflicted but a few months we are ſure, not many years, but God gave him an hundred and forty years of proſperity in this world, after his affliction.</p>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>God ſometimes doth, and alwayes can recompence our ſhort ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings with long comfortable enjoyments, even in this life.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Joſeph,</hi> for his thirteen or fourteen years ſlavery and impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment in <hi>Egypt,</hi> had fourſcore years liberty and high advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there. And though the Lord doth nor alwayes, nor often make ſuch compenſations in this world; yet he will compenſate all the ſufferings of his faithful ſervants, with longer, not only comfortable, but glorious enjoyments, yea, with an eternal en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of glory in the world to come (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17.)</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Note;
<q>The Lord can make our old age, our extream old age, even a youth to us, or as comfortable to us as our youth.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He can give health and ſtrength to the very laſt, he can give a ſpring in the winter of our age. Thus it was with <hi>Job;</hi> he did not only live long, but flouriſhed in the health of his body, as
<pb n="1022" facs="tcp:48669:527"/> much as in the plenty of his eſtate. The Lord can forbid diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, he can forbid the Gout, the Stone, or any other pain, to touch the perſon of an old man, if he pleaſeth. Some are even afraid to be old, becauſe of the infirmities of old age; but God, who continues life, can prevent or preſerve us from the natural, as well as the providencial evils of it. <hi>Solomon (Eccl.</hi> 12.1.) calleth old age, <hi>the evil day, and the years wherein there is no pleaſure;</hi> and he uſeth it as an argument to move thoſe who are young, to remember their Creator: yet God is able to make old age a good day to us, and to lengthen out our pleaſures (thoſe pleaſures that are ſutable to old age) as long as he is pleaſed to lengthen out our lives; ſo that, the comforts and contentments of our lives, ſhall run parallel with the length of our lives, to the end of our lives. Thus <hi>Job</hi> lived, he lived comfortably, he lived healthful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Lord preventing the decays or uſual dilapidations of his houſe of clay, as will appear further in the next words. <hi>After this</hi> Job <hi>lived an hundred and forty years,</hi>
                     <q>And ſaw his ſons, and his ſons ſons, even four generations.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>That is, <hi>Job</hi> lived to be a great great Grandfather; he ſaw his ſons,<note place="margin">Quartam gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rationem intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligo incluſivè, ita ut intelliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur vidiſſe eti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am abnepotes, hi enim ſunt in quarto gradu à progenitore ſcil. Abavo. <hi>Piſc.</hi>
                     </note> and his Grand-children, and his great Grand-children, and his great great Grand-children, four generations. <hi>Joſeph (Gen.</hi> 50.23.) lived to ſee but the third generation, he was only a great Grand-father. Many among us live to be great Grand-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and great Grand-mothers; but to be a great great Grand-father, that is, to ſee the fourth generation, is very rare. This is recorded of <hi>Job,</hi> not only to ſet forth the greatneſs of his age, but alſo to ſhew the greatneſs of his bleſsing, and the exceeding greatneſs of the mercy and goodneſs of God to him, in multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Family; he ſaw a numerous iſſue, to take comfort in all that latter part of his life. <hi>He ſaw</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>his ſons, and his ſons ſons, even four generations.</hi> The learned in that Language, take notice,<note place="margin">Verbo <hi>videndi</hi> pucundiſſimus filioram ac no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potum conſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</note> that the Hebrew word rendred, <hi>ſaw,</hi> implieth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light; and doubtleſs, <hi>Job</hi> had a moſt delightful ſight of <hi>his ſons, and his ſons ſons.</hi> It is no where ſaid, that <hi>Job</hi> ſaw his ſheep, or his oxen, or any of his riches, to take delight in them; but <hi>Job ſaw his ſons, and his ſons ſons;</hi> this ſight was thouſand times more pleaſing to him, than the ſight of his fourteen thouſand ſheep, or of his thouſand yoak of oxen.</p>
                  <pb n="1023" facs="tcp:48669:527"/>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>To have and enjoy a numerous family, is greatly contentful to man, and a great bleſſing of God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Job</hi> received a great bleſſing, when he had ſons and daughters of his own, as many as before; but when he <hi>ſaw his ſons, and his ſons ſons, even to the fourth generation,</hi> that was the crown of all his outward bleſsings. <hi>Eliphaz</hi> fore-ſpake this of him, upon ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of his repentance, and profiting under the correcting hand of God (Chap. 5.25.) <hi>Thou ſhalt know alſo that thy ſeed ſhall be great, and thy off-ſpring as the graſs of the earth.</hi> The children of all men, or all the children of men, are as graſs for fadingneſs (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.6.) But when <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſaid, <hi>Thy off-ſpring ſhall be as the graſs of the earth,</hi> his meaning was, they ſhall flouriſh as the graſs, and they ſhall be many, very many, as the graſs of the earth. <hi>David (Pſal.</hi> 127.3, 4, 5:) ſpeaks of this great bleſsing, the multiplying of the ſeed of the righteous, as their great contentment; <hi>Lo, children are the heritage of the Lord, and the fruit of the womb is his reward. As arrows in the hand of a mighty man, ſo are children of the youth: happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them;</hi> that is, he hath a great out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward happineſs. Many children may contribute to our happineſs many wayes, though ſome have had many unhappineſſes in one. The next <hi>Pſalm</hi> inſiſts upon the ſame mercy, under other meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phors; <hi>Thy Wife ſhall be as the fruitful Vine by the ſides of thy houſe, thy children like Olive-plants round about thy Table; Lo, thus ſhall the man be bleſſed that feareth the Lord.</hi> And (<hi>verſ.</hi> 6.) <hi>Yea, thou ſhalt ſee thy childrens children, and peace upon Iſrael.</hi> It is a great affliction, a grief of eyes, yea, a breaking of the heart, to behold bad children; but how ſweet a ſight is it, to behold good and obedient children, and them many! There are two conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons very grievous to ſee our children in. Firſt, to ſee them in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery. <hi>Rachel (Jer.</hi> 31.15. <hi>Mat.</hi> 2.) <hi>mourned for her children, and would not be comforted, becauſe they were not;</hi> ſhe ſaw them murdered before her eyes. Such a ſight had <hi>Zedekiah (Jer.</hi> 50.10.) the King of <hi>Babilon</hi> brought his children, and ſlew them before his eyes; he made him ſee that horrid ſpectacle, and then put out his eyes (<hi>verſ.</hi> 11.) Secondly, to ſee children ſin, and going on in a courſe of ſin; that is a greater, a far greater affliction than the
<pb n="1024" facs="tcp:48669:528"/> former. It is ſaid (<hi>Gen.</hi> 26.34.) <hi>When</hi> Eſau <hi>was forty years old, he took to wife</hi> Judeth, <hi>the daughter of</hi> Berith <hi>the</hi> Hittite, <hi>which was a grief of mind to</hi> Iſaac <hi>and</hi> Rebecca. To ſee their ſon match among the prophane and uncircumciſed, both in heart and fleſh, was a cut, a wound, a deep wound in their ſpirits. Again (Chap. 27. <hi>ult.) Rebecca ſaid to Iſaac, I am weary of my life, becauſe of the daughters of Heth. If Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, ſuch as theſe which are of the daughters of the Land, what good ſhall my life do me?</hi> Better be out of the world, than ſee my ſons miſcarry. Theſe two ſights, to ſee children ſuffering, or to ſee them ſinning, are a pain, not only to the eyes, but to the hearts of parents. But to ſee them, Firſt, Proſperous in their way; Secondly, Pious, keeping the way of the Lord; to have and ſee ſuch children, and childrens Children, to the third and fourth ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, how delightful is this! The Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> profeſſed (3 <hi>Epiſt. ver.</hi> 4.) <hi>I have no greater joy, than to hear that my children walk in the truth.</hi> He means his ſpiritual children, thoſe whom he had converted to the faith, and begotten to Chriſt in the miniſtery of the Word. O what a joy was it to that holy Apoſtles heart, to ſee them walk anſwerably to the profeſſion of the Goſpel, and his expectation! Now as that was ſo great a joy to him, that he had no greater; ſo 'tis an unſpeakable joy when godly parents ſee their natural children ſpiritual, and walking in the truth. To ſee children new born, to ſee them gracious, and to ſee them proſperous alſo, what a bleſſed ſight is this! And this was the ſight doubtleſs which <hi>Job</hi> had, he ſaw his children, <hi>His ſons, and his ſons ſons,</hi> to the fourth generation. His bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs, as to all without him in this life, was at the higheſt, when he ſaw the proſperity of his children, both in ſoul and body. Thus <hi>Job</hi> was bleſſed every way, he was bleſſed with riches, bleſſed with long life, bleſſed in the multiplication of his family; he was bleſſed alſo in his death, as appeareth in the next and laſt words of this Chapter and Book.</p>

<pb n="1025" facs="tcp:48669:528"/> dye is the conſuming end of all our lives, and to a good man 'tis an entrance into eternal life; Such, and <hi>ſo</hi> Job <hi>died.</hi> The Lord having ſpoken of his life, is not ſilent about his death; The ſtory, the holy ſtory brings <hi>Job</hi> to his grave: and that could not but be a bleſſed death, which was the cloſe of a gracious life. <hi>So</hi> Job <hi>died.</hi> Death is the ſeparation of the ſoul from the body; 'tis the ſleep of the body in the grave, and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Death takes all ſooner or latter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Job</hi> lived a long time, but he did not out-live death;<note place="margin">Mors ultima clauſula vitae. Mors ultima linea rerum.</note> he enjoyed an hundred and forty years proſperity in this world, yet he left the world; He lived long, yet a day came when he could not live a day longer. 'Tis ſaid of all the long livers (<hi>Gen.</hi> 5.) <hi>They died.</hi> Adam <hi>lived nine hundred and thirty years, and he died.</hi> Seth <hi>lived nine hundred and twelve years, and he died. Methuſelah</hi> (the longeſt liver in this world) <hi>lived nine hundred ſixty and nine years, and he died.</hi> Here <hi>Job lived an hundred and forty, and ſo he dyed. David</hi> put the queſtion of all men (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.48.) <hi>What man is he that liveth and ſhall not ſee death?</hi> How great or how good, how rich or how wiſe, how ſtrong or how valiant ſoever any man living is, he muſt dye. How long ſoever any man hath lived in this world, he muſt dye, for the world muſt dye; there muſt be a diſſolution of <hi>all things,</hi> and therefore a diſſolution of <hi>all men</hi> (Pſal. 82.6, 7.) <hi>I ſaid, ye are gods, but ye ſhall dye like men.</hi> Kings and Princes, who have the priviledge to be <hi>called gods,</hi> have not the priviledge <hi>of God,</hi> not to dye like men. This is a common theam, I intend not to ſtay upon it; only, let me tell you, death will overtake us all ſooner or later, upon a double account.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Becauſe it is appointed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Becauſe it is deſerved. It is appointed unto men once to dye</hi> (Heb. 9.27.) and all men have deſerved to dye, to dye eternally, and therefore much more to dye naturally (<hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12.) <hi>As by one man ſin entred into the world, and death by ſin, and ſo death paſt upon all men for that all have ſinned.</hi> Now ſeing the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all men is a dying condition, receive theſe four cautions.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Prepare for death.</hi> There is no avoiding it at the long run, therefore be ready to entertain it at laſt; and, becauſe we
<pb n="1026" facs="tcp:48669:529"/> may dye at any time, be preparing for death at all times. How miſerable are they who are ſo old that they cannot live, and yet ſo unprepared that they are afraid to dye? <hi>Job</hi> died, and we muſt: If ſo, Is it not our wiſdome to prepare for death?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Submit quietly to the arreſt of death. There is no ſtriving with the decrees of God. Our death is under a divine appointment (<hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 8.8.) <hi>There is no diſcharge in that war,</hi> no priviledge to be pleaded, no exemption, no preſcription. Your ſtrength cannot ſtand againſt the aſſaults of death, your prudence and policy cannot find any way of eſcape from it, nor can your piety or godlineſs deliver you out of the hands of natural death. <hi>As there is no work, nor deviſe, nor knowledge in the grave whither we are going</hi> (Eccleſ. 9.10.) ſo there is no knowledg, no device, no wiſdom, can keep us from going into the grave, no, not our graces. Grace is as ſalt to the ſoul, preſerving it from moral corruption for ever: But it cannot keep the body from natural corruption in this world,<note place="margin">Mors eſt nobis nimis domeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, utpote quam in viſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus noſtris circumſerim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>. <hi>Plutarch.</hi> in Conſol. ad Apoll.</note> becauſe our graces in this world are mingled with corruption. Death is domeſtical to us, that is, we have the ſeed of it within our ſelves, we carry it daily in our bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els and in our boſomes; therefore ſubmit quietly to it, for there is no avoiding it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Seing all muſt dye, get that removed which is the troubler of a death-bed, and the ſting of death; get that removed which makes death bitter, get that removed which makes death, <hi>the King of terrours,</hi> ſo terrible, that is, ſin. This ſhould be our ſtudy all the days of our life, to get rid of ſin, to be dying to ſin daily; becauſe we muſt dye at laſt, and may dye, for all that we know, or can aſſure our ſelves, any day we live (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.56.) <hi>The ſting of death is ſin.</hi> Whenſoever, or in what way ſoever we dye, it will be well with us, if the ſting of death be firſt pull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out; and whenſoever we dye, after never ſo long a life, it will be miſerable, if we dye in our ſins; as Chriſt told the Jews in the higheſt threat, <hi>I go away, and ye ſhall dye in your ſins (John</hi> 8.21.) They that dye in their ſins, dye a double death at once, a temporal and an eternal death together. And to thoſe who have got the ſting of death pulled out, that is, the guilt of ſin removed and waſhed off by the blood of Chriſt, I would,</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Take this caution. If you would have death eaſie to you, dye more and more to ſin daily. Some, who are dead to ſin,
<pb n="1027" facs="tcp:48669:529"/> may find much life of ſin remaining in them; and they who have much of the life of ſin in them will never dye eaſily, they will find ſtrong bands in their death, which, in another ſenſe, ſome wicked men find not (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.4.) While either ſin, or ſelf, or the world are lively in us, death will be greivous to us: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let them who are dead to ſin, never think themſelves dead enough to it while they live; they who are moſt dead to ſin and the world, have the ſweeteſt and moſt comfortable paſſage out of the world. <hi>So</hi> Job <hi>dyed,</hi>
                     <q>Being old.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It muſt needs be that <hi>Job</hi> was an old man, when he had lived an hundred and forty years after all his changes before this change came: Why then is it added, he died <hi>being old, or being an old man?</hi> Surely, to teach us this leſſon.</p>
                  <q>Old age and death cannot be far aſunder.</q>
                  <p>'Tis a truth, young men and death are not very far aſunder, youth and death are at no great diſtance; but when we ſee an old man, we may conclude, <hi>that death and he are very near neighbours.</hi> While we ſee an old man with his ſtaff in his hand, we may ſay, he carrieth a rapper in his hand, by which at every ſtep he knocks at the door of the grave. There is no man, not the youngeſt man, that can reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on certainly upon one day beyond what he hath, and therefore <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> admoniſheth us (<hi>Prov.</hi> 27.1.) <hi>Beaſt not of to-morrow, for thou knoweſt not what a day may bring forth.</hi> And the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> checks thoſe, who would reckon upon a day, he tells them upon the matter, <hi>That they reckon without their hoaſt</hi> (James 4.13.) <hi>Go to now, ye that ſay to day, or to-morrow we will go into ſuch a City, and continue there a year, and buy, and ſell, and get gain:</hi> And then at the 14th verſe, <hi>Whereas ye know not what ſhall be on the morrow;</hi> for (ſaith he) <hi>What is your life? it is even a vapour that appeareth for a little while, and then vaniſheth away.</hi> They that are youngeſt have not a day, nor an hour in their power to reckon upon; what then have they that are old? We may ſay of them, <hi>They are even paſt their reckoning.</hi> A woman near her time will ſometimes ſay, <hi>ſhe hath but a day to reckon;</hi> and ſome will ſay, <hi>they have never a day to reckon:</hi> old men may ſay ſo, <hi>they have not a day to reckon. Young men may dye; old men muſt dye:</hi> Then let old men be much in the meditation of
<pb n="1028" facs="tcp:48669:530"/> death, let them be often looking into their graves; their gray hairs that do ſo, are found in the way of wiſdom. Job <hi>dyed, being old:</hi> There was no longer ſtaying for him in this world. Once more,</p>
                  <p>Job <hi>dyed being old,</hi>
                     <q>And full of days.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is a twofold fullneſs.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, A fullneſs of ſatiety.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, A fullneſs of ſatisfaction.</p>
                  <p>They are full in a way of ſatiety, who loath that which they are filled with, 'tis burthenſome to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>m. They are full in a way of ſatisfaction, who having enough, are pleaſed, and deſire no more. Some expound this Text of <hi>Job,</hi> in the former ſence, he was <hi>full of days,</hi> that is, he had a fullneſs of ſatiety upon him, he had liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo long, that his life was a burden to him, he had lived till he was weary of living, his life was tedious and grievous to him. It is ſaid (<hi>Revel.</hi> 9.6.) <hi>In thoſe days ſhall men ſeek death, and ſhall not find it; and ſhall deſire to dye, and death ſhall flee from them.</hi> That which moſt flee from, ſome purſue, and it fleeth from them. None are ſo unfit to dye, as they who upon the account ſpoken of in that Text, ſeek death and deſire to dye. I do not conceive, that <hi>Job</hi> was full of days in the former notion, as the ſtomack may be full of meat and loath it, or be burthened with it, but as having had enough of it, though well liked to the laſt morſel. And I am ſure he was not full of days, when he dyed in the latter notion, as one wearied with the troubles of his life; for all his latter days were a bleſſing to him, and he bleſſed in them all: His laſt days in this world being his beſt days of worldly enjoyment, he could have no reaſon upon any worldly account to deſire a departure out of the world.</p>
                  <p>I grant, a good man though he hath not lived many days may be full of days, even to wearineſs, by reaſon of his temptations, corruptions, and ſins; of which kind of wearineſs the Apoſtle ſpeaks (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.2.) <hi>In this</hi> (earthly houſe of the body) <hi>we grown earneſtly, deſiring to be clothed upon with our houſe, which is from heaven.</hi> And upon this account poſſibly, <hi>Job</hi> himſelf might be weary of his life, and deſire the death of his body, that he might be delivered from the body of that death. But <hi>Jobs</hi>
                     <pb n="1029" facs="tcp:48669:530"/> worldly life was as ſweet as it was long, he was as full of bleſſings as he was of days; and therefore, doubtleſs, he was only ſatisfied with living, not tired with it: He did not loath his natural life, nor did he hunger after a longer life in this world; he hungred after eternity, not time: He did not hunger after a longer life, as they do who have their portion in this life, how long ſoever they have lived. A worldly man is never ſatisfied with living in the world; he never hath his belly full of living here, while he ſees he may (as <hi>Job</hi> might) fill his belly with the good things of this life. But as <hi>Job</hi> had lived very long, and very well on earth, ſo he knew there was a better life to be had in heaven; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was full of days, both as having had many, and as having no deſire after more on earth. As he was not (which <hi>David</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precated, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.24.) <hi>taken away in the midſt of his days;</hi> ſo he was willing to come to the end of his days; and for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, might well be ſaid to dye, <hi>being old and full of days.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Theſe words, ſo <hi>Job died, being old and full of days,</hi> may note as his willingneſs to dye, ſo the eaſineſs of his death; he was come to a full ripeneſs for death. Fruit that is fully ripe is ſoon gathered, and ſometimes drops off alone from the tree. <hi>Job</hi> was every way ripe for death; his body was ripe, <hi>he was full of days;</hi> his ſoul was ripe, he was full of grace: ſurely then his was a ſpontaneous death, a very ſweet way of dying. His natural ſtrength was not much (being old) to make reſiſtance againſt death; and his ſpiritual ſtrength was ſo much, that it cauſed him to make no reſiſtance againſt it, or rather at once joyfully to embrace and overcome it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Theſe words, ſo <hi>Job dyed being full of days,</hi> may have this ſpiritual meaning; <hi>His days were full.</hi> He did not live empty days, or void, blank days; but as he was full of days, ſo his days were full, full of good works and holy duties. That mans days are empty, though he be full of days, or how many days ſoever he hath lived, who hath lived in vanity, and done little good with his life. But we have reaſon to ſay, <hi>Job dyed full of days,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his days were full of good done, as well as of good received; he had not a long being only, but a long life in the world, living to good, yea, his beſt in duty both to God and man. Thus <hi>Job dyed being old, and full of days.</hi> From this latter part of the verſe,</p>
                  <pb n="1030" facs="tcp:48669:531"/>
                  <p>Obſerve;
<q>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> When a godly man dyeth, he is ſatisfied with the time he hath lived, he hath his fill of days, he craves no more.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though no length of this life can ſatisfie him, yet he is ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the length of his life. A godly man in ſome caſes may crave a little more time; He may ſay, as (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.24.) <hi>O take me not away in the midſt of my days,</hi> and (as elſewhere) <hi>O ſpare me a little, that I may recover my ſtrength, before I go hence, and be no more</hi> (Pſal. 39.13.) Yet this is a truth ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as to good old men (living as <hi>Job</hi> had done) when they dye, they have had their fill of living. A Heathen ſaid, and he ſpake it after a heatheniſh manner;<note place="margin">Si mihi quis Deus largiatur ut ex hac aetate repueraſcam, &amp; in cunis va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giam valdè re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſem. <hi>Cato.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>If any God would give me the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledg to be young again, and to cry in a Craile, I would not thank him for it, I have had living enough.</hi> If a vertuous Heathen hath ſaid ſo by the light of reaſon and morality; then, doubtleſs, a godly Chriſtian may much more ſay ſo through the power of faith and grace. It cannot be ſaid of all men who dye (as <hi>Job</hi> did) being old, that they in this notion <hi>dyed</hi> (as <hi>Job</hi> did) <hi>full of days:</hi> For as ſome godly young men have been fully ſatisfied with a few days, and have ſaid they have lived as long as they deſired, and could ſay with <hi>Paul, We deſire to be deſolved, and to be with Chriſt,</hi> which is far better (<hi>Phil.</hi> 1.23.) Yet ſome old men are very much unſatisfied with their many days; ſome old men would be young again: This argues they have made but little improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their days, or that they have got little, if any thing, of that all their days, which ſhould be the ſtudy of every day, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the death of Chriſt, and ſo a readineſs for a better life. For an old man to wiſh himſelf young again, is like one who with great labour hath clamber'd up a ſteep hill, and wiſheth he were at the foot or bottome of it again; 'tis as if a man, who (having been long toſt in a ſtorm, between rocks and ſands) is got near a ſafe harbour, ſhould wiſh himſelf out at ſea again. They have not a true taſt, much leſs, a lively hope of that life which is to come, who would return to this upon ſuch hazardous and uneaſie terms?</p>
                  <pb n="1031" facs="tcp:48669:531"/>
                  <p>Secondly, As theſe words note a readineſs or a willingneſs to dye,</p>
                  <p>Obſerve;
<q>A good man is willing to leave this world.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He is not thruſt nor forced out of it, but departs; he is not pluck't off, but falls off like ripe fruit from the tree; <hi>His ſoul is not required of him</hi> (as 'tis ſaid of the rich man, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.20.<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</note>) but given up, and reſigned by him; he is not taken, but goes out of the world. It is ſaid indeed (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 57.1.) <hi>Merciful men are taken away</hi> (by Gods commiſſion given to death) <hi>from the evil to come;</hi> but they are not taken away from (as being unwilling to part with, and leave) any preſent good. A gracious man hath uſually a readineſs to dye, in a twofold notion. Firſt, As readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſignifies preparedneſs; Secondly, As readineſs ſignifies a willingneſs to dye: And always the firſt readineſs promotes the ſecond. The more prepared any one is to dye, the more willing he is to dye. That man can ſay, <hi>Lord, now let thy ſervant depart in peace,</hi> whoſe eye of faith hath ſeen his ſalvation. <hi>We</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, ſpeaking of believers, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.8.) <hi>are willing to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from the body,</hi> that is, to dye. And the word there uſed ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies not only the freeſt choice, but (if I may ſo ſpeak) the <hi>good will</hi> or <hi>good pleaſure</hi> of mans will, as it often ſignifies God's. As a godly man hath a peculiar way of living, ſo of dying; and the reaſon of both, is, becauſe he ſees bleſſed eternity beyond time, and himſelf, by a well-grounded (that is, a Scriptural) hope, a partaker of the bleſſedneſs of it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Note;
<q>They dye full of days, who fill their days, or whoſe days are full.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>That is, who fill their days with or whoſe days are full of the fruits of righteouſneſs, of faith and repentance, of love and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritableneſs. <hi>Stephen</hi> (Acts 6.8.) <hi>was full of faith and power.</hi> They dye full of days in old age, who, as it is ſaid (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 92.14.) <hi>bring forth</hi> (ſuch) <hi>fruit in their old age;</hi>

                     </note> who dye as <hi>Dorcas</hi> (Acts 9.36.) <hi>full of good works, and almeſ-deeds which they have done.</hi> It was ſaid of a famous Painter, <hi>No day past him without drawing a line.</hi> A <hi>Romane</hi> Emperour ſaid, <hi>I have loſt a day,</hi> when
<pb n="1032" facs="tcp:48669:532"/> he did no good that day. We may well reckon thoſe days loſt in which we do no good, in which we draw not ſome white line, ſome golden line of grace and holineſs. Then what account will their days come to, who paſs not a day, but they draw black lines, filthy lines of ſin and wickedneſs, or whoſe days are all blotted with the worſt abominations of the day they live in? If thoſe days are empty and loſt, wherein we do no good, and are not made better; what then becomes of their days, and where will they be found, but in the Devils Almanack, who do nothing but evil, and daily become worſe and worſe? So then, they only dye full of days, who live doing the will of God, and denying their own; who live mortifying corruptions, and reſiſting temptations; who live exerciſing their graces, and anſwering their duties to God and man: This, this is to live our days, and to dye full of days.</p>
                  <p>Again, as their days are full, who are full of grace in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and of good works towards men; ſo are theirs who are full of the mercies and bleſſings of God, eſpecially, theirs, whoſe days are full of ſoul mercies and bleſſings, whoſe hearts are full of peace with God, full of joy in God, full of aſſurance of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God. They whoſe days are filled with theſe divine enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, dye full of days, how few days ſoever they have lived in this world: They who live thus, live many days in one day; they who live thus, have the taſt and firſt fruits of eternity every day; and therefore cannot but be ſatisfied with their days, be they many or be they few.</p>

<pb n="1033" facs="tcp:48669:532"/> even in this world; yet that which doth chiefly ſatisfie them, is, that long life, of which the longeſt life in this world is but a ſhadow, and to which it is a very nothing. What is this long life? Surely, not a life of an hundred and forty years long, as <hi>Job's</hi> was. <hi>Job</hi> was ſo ſatisfied with the length of his life, that he was willing to the (as hath been ſhewed) but <hi>Job</hi> was not ſo ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with it, as to take that for his long life.

                     <hi>Iſaac</hi> alſo it is ſaid (<hi>Gen.</hi> 35.28, 29.) <hi>He died, being old and full of dayes:</hi> both had their fill of time; but that which filled them both, and that which only can fill any, whoſe lives are yet mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured by time, is the hope of a bleſſed eternity.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall cloſe the Point with an anſwer to this queſtion; why no more is ſaid of <hi>Job,</hi> but, That <hi>he died being old and full of dayes,</hi> whereas in both thoſe places laſt named, concerning <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſaac,</hi> it is not only ſaid, that they <hi>died being old and full of days,</hi> but this is added, <hi>And were gathered to their people.</hi> Abraham <hi>died, and was gathered to his people:</hi> Iſaac <hi>dyed, and was gathered to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:</hi> Why is it not alſo ſaid of <hi>Job,</hi> ſo good a man, dying full of dayes, and fuller of graces, <hi>that he was gathered to his people?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſaac</hi> lived and died among a people, who were (as themſelves were) in Covenant with God; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>Job</hi> lived among the <hi>Idumeans,</hi> ſome affirming him to be of the poſterity of <hi>Eſau,</hi> others, of <hi>Abraham,</hi> by his ſecond wife <hi>Ketu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah:</hi> Now all the ſons which <hi>Abraham</hi> had by her, he <hi>ſent away from Iſaac his ſon (while he yet lived) Eaſtward into the Eaſt Country</hi> (Gen. 25.6.) So that it being doubtful (at leaſt) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the people, among whom <hi>Job</hi> lived, were a godly people or
<pb n="1034" facs="tcp:48669:533"/> no, and that they were not, being more probable (as was ſhewed, if not concluded, in opening the firſt verſe of the firſt Chapter; for this reaſon I ſay) we may ſuppoſe (for the Scripture determines nothing in this matter) that when the death of <hi>Job</hi> was ſpoken of, nothing was ſpoken of his being gathered to his people. <hi>So Job died being old and full of dayes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>This is that Job, <hi>who was,</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>Firſt, A ſorrowful man, yea, even a man of ſorrows (for a time among men) as ſome expound his name.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>A man hated</hi> (by Satan at all times) as others ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound his name.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, A man highly approved and loved of God, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the teſtimony which he gave of him, both firſt and laſt.</p>
                  <q>This is that Job, <hi>who was,</hi>

                  <p>Firſt, Famous for the afflictions with which God exerciſed and tryed him to the utmoſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, More famous for his patience and conſtancy under thoſe afflictions and tryals.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Moſt famous for his wonderful deliverance out of thoſe afflictions and tryals.</p>
                  <q>This is that Job, <hi>who was,</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>Firſt, Famous for his riches and proſperity.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, More famous for his vertues and integrity.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Moſt famous for his victory over Satan in his deepeſt adverſity.</p>
                  <q>This is that Job, <hi>who was,</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>Firſt, Reviled by his Wife.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Reproached by his Friends.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Deſerted by his neareſt Relations, in the day of his greateſt need.</p>
                  <q>This is that Job, <hi>who was,</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>Firſt, Unjuſtly accuſed of, charged with, cenſured for, the worſt of iniquities.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Who ſtoutly maintained his own innocency againſt all thoſe cenſures and charges.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Who was clearly acquitted from them all, by the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of his own conſcience alwayes, and by the teſtimony of God himſelf in the end.</p>
                  <q>This is that Job, <hi>who was,</hi>
                  </q>
                  <pb n="1035" facs="tcp:48669:533"/>
                  <p>Firſt, Greatly diſtreſſed by the malice of the devil, through the permiſsion of God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Mightily ſupported againſt the malice of the devil, by the power of God, in all his diſtreſſes.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Fully reſolved to truſt in God with all his heart, though he died under his hand, in never ſo great diſtreſs.</p>
                  <q>This is that Job, <hi>who,</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>Firſt, In the greatneſs of his pain, expoſtulated ſometimes with God over-boldly; yet,</p>
                  <p>Secondly, At the laſt ſubmitted and humbled himſelf at the foot of God meekly.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Was honoured as a Mediator for his miſtaken friends, and accepted in it by God graciouſly.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Once more,</hi> This is that Job, <hi>who,</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>Firſt, After his reſtoring, was filled with the bleſsings of this life.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Lived long, even to fulneſs of dayes, in the full en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of thoſe bleſsings.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Died peaceably, and paſſed ſweetly into the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a better, of a longer, even an eternal life.</p>
                  <p>Thus I am come to the end of <hi>Job,</hi> and to the end of the Book of <hi>Job;</hi> yet before I end let me leave theſe five words, as ſo many Uſes of the whole Book of <hi>Job.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, While you live in this world, live in the expectation of, and preparation for changes: <hi>Job</hi> met with them, and who may not?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Be patient under all the troubleſom changes which you meet with in this world: <hi>Job</hi> is your pattern.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Never meaſure the heart of God towards you, by his hand upon you; judge not of your ſpiritual eſtate, by what ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in your temporal. That was the grand miſtake of <hi>Jobs</hi> friends, and it was his honour to withſtand them in it, and to ſtand faſt to his integrity, in the loweſt fall of his eſtate in this world.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, What-ever God doth to you, or with you, ſubmit freely to him: So did <hi>Job</hi> at firſt.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, and laſtly, How low ſoever you are brought, yet hope for a good iſſue, poſsibly, in this life, aſſuredly in that life which is to come. <hi>Job</hi> found both at laſt.</p>
                  <p>To cloſe all, There are examples of two ſorts recorded in the
<pb n="1036" facs="tcp:48669:534"/> holy Scriptures. Firſt, for caution, <hi>To the intent we ſhould not luſt after evil things, as they alſo luſted.</hi> Secondly, for imitation, <hi>To the intent we ſhould do good things, which they al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>o did; and ſuffer evil things, with the ſame mind, and in the ſame manner, as they likewiſe ſuffered.</hi> Holy <hi>Job</hi> may be to us an example of caution in ſome things, for even he had (and who hath not) his failings: He al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o may be an example in many things, how both to do good, and ſuffer evil. And among all imitable examples (except that of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, of whom in ſome reſpects, <hi>Job</hi> may be called a type, and the things which hap'ned to him in his ſufferings, may be called (as the Apoſtle uſeth the word in another caſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.11.) types of what hap'ned to Chriſt in his; I ſay, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all imitable examples, except his) this of <hi>Job</hi> is one of the moſt emi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>nt in doing, &amp; the moſt eminent of all in ſuffering. Let him therefore be our pattern to do and ſuffer by, our copy in both to write by, our mirror or looking-glaſs to obſerve the diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſures, and compoſe the features and motions, both of our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and inward man by; let us admire and follow his unſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted integrity in morals, his ſervent zeal about ſpirituals, his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaken faith, and hope for eternals; let us admire and follow his moderation in a high eſtate, his contentation in a low eſtate, his ſtedfaſtneſs with, and for God, in every eſtate.</p>
                  <p>He that ſtayeth in the bare ſpeculation of what is written by inſpiration from God in the Text, or of what is written through the help of God, by the ſtudy of man in the Expoſition of this Book, <hi>is like unto a man, beholding his natural face in a glaſs</hi> ('tis the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> his compariſon, in the firſt Chapter of his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to the ſcattered Tribes) <hi>for he beholdeth himſelf, and goeth his way, and ſtraightway forgetteth what manner of man he was,</hi> that is, he forgets his own ſpots &amp; defects, and ſuffers them to encreaſe to more ungodlineſs: But he that reduceth or brings down his ſpeculation to action at all times, and to a preparation for ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and free ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>bmiſsion to the will of God, without any hard thoughts of God, in hard times, and ſo conforming himſelf to what he ſeeth in this glaſs, continueth in it; this man ſhall be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed (as <hi>Job</hi> was, though not in the ſame manner as <hi>Job</hi> was) both in doing and ſuffering; and after he hath ſuffered a while, ſhall be perfected and lifted up far above the reach of ſuffering, and (which is far better) above the fear of ſinning any more for ever.</p>
